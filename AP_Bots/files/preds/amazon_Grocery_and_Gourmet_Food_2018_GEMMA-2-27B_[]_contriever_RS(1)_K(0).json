The flavor is smooth and slightly floral, with a hint of sweetness. I appreciate that it's sourced directly from high mountain estates in South India, which speaks to its quality. While I can't speak to its weight loss benefits, I do find it to be a refreshing and enjoyable tea to sip on throughout the day.  The 25 cup yield is a nice bonus. \n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an Amazon customer that likes to write reviews for products.
