However, WSNs system designers must fulfill the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements imposed by the applications (and users). Very harsh and dynamic physical environments and extremely limited energy/computing/memory/communication node resources are major obstacles for satisfying QoS metrics such as reliability, timeliness and system lifetime. The limited communication range of WSN nodes, link asymmetry and the characteristics of the physical environment lead to a major source of QoS degradation in WSNs. This paper proposes a Link Reliability based Two-Hop Routing protocol for wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The protocol achieves to reduce packet deadline miss ratio while consid- ering link reliability, two-hop velocity and power efficiency and utilizes memory and computational effective methods for estimating the link metrics. Numerical results provide insights that the protocol has a lower packet deadline miss ratio and longer sensor network lifetime. The results show that the proposed protocol is a feasible solution to the QoS routing problem in wireless sensor networks that support real-time applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.82}, {"id": "1111", "output": "\"Empowering Learner-Centered Education through Information Technology: A Knowledge Transfer Framework for Effective Learning Processes\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Of course, such phenomena are observed similarly in learning/teaching means, methods and environments. Information technology enforces learners to be free from the spatio-temporal constraints, and provides the ubiquitous learning environment. Now, when we investigate our learning/teaching means we cannot design learning/learning procedures without effective utilization of information technology.\n\nIn this paper, we discuss how to make use of information technology with a view to supporting the learning work of each learner fruitfully and successively. The learning activity is not an action-based work but is composed of various kinds of repeatedly-planned works. Thus, the learning process should be designed under the goal to be attained stepwise. In particular, it is important in the application of information technology for learning to estimate the understanding degree and feedback the estimated result to learners. We discuss this viewpoint on the basis of our knowledge transfer scheme that the learning is to transfer knowledge in the outside of learner into the inside of learner, such as brain, notes, etc.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "1112", "output": "Cross-Modal Cross-Domain Person Re-Identification via Dual Alignment Network for Robust Performance", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Most of the current works rely on a supervised training manner. However, in real-world applications, manual collection of pair-wise RGB-Infrared (IR) person data is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, when a trained model is directly used in another domain, there is usually a significant performance drop. To overcome the above problems, we make the first attempt to transfer the learned model to a new RGB-IR domain which is unlabeled. The practical problem covers two kinds of challenges, i.e., cross-modal (RGB-Infrared) and cross-domain (different dataset) person Re-ID. Previous works have often considered only one of them either cross-modal or cross-domain. In this work, we propose a dual alignment network (DAN) to solve the RGB-Infrared cross-modal cross-domain person Re-ID problem. This network consists of three parts: Domain Adversarial Alignment component (DAA), Pseudo Label Generation module for target domain (PLG), and Cross-Modal Alignment component (CMA). These three modules complement and promote the model to learn domain-invariant and modality-invariant person representations. Further, we propose a protocol of cross-modal cross-domain person Re-ID by synthesizing target domains by adding random noise, adjusting the lighting intensity, and changing the background color, respectively. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets under the same cross-modalities across domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "1113", "output": "\"Accelerating Discrete Optimization with Massively Parallel Architectures: A GPU-Based Approach for Efficient Inference and Scalability\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Optimizing Aggregated Costs in Artificial Intelligence\", \"Massively Parallel Architectures for Discrete Optimization\", \"GPU-Based Techniques for Efficient Inference\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The optimization of the aggregated cost of a network of cost functions arises in a variety of problems including  (WCSPs),  (DCOP), as well as optimization in stochastic variants such as the tasks of finding the  (MPE) in . Inference-based algorithms are powerful techniques for solving discrete optimization problems, which can be used independently or in combination with other techniques. However, their applicability is often limited by their compute intensive nature and their space requirements. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a novel inference-based technique, which exploits modern massively parallel architectures, such as those found in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), to speed up the resolution of exact and approximated inference-based algorithms for discrete optimization. The paper studies the proposed algorithm in both centralized and distributed optimization contexts. The paper demonstrates that the use of GPUs provides significant advantages in terms of runtime and scalability, achieving up to two orders of magnitude in speedups and showing a considerable reduction in execution time (up to 345 times faster) with respect to a sequential version.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1114", "output": "\"Unveiling Microbial Complexity: Advances in Meta-barcoding and the Challenges of Large-Scale Bioinformatic Analysis\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

If the investigation is aimed only at the microbiome taxonomic structure, a target-based metagenomic approach, here also referred as Meta-barcoding, is generally applied. This approach commonly involves the selective amplification of a species-specific genetic marker (DNA meta-barcode) in the whole taxonomic range of interest and the exploration of its taxon-related variants through High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies. The accessibility to proper computational systems for the large-scale bioinformatic analysis of HTS data represents, currently, one of the major challenges in advanced Meta-barcoding projects.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "1115", "output": "\"Predicting Multi-SNS Posting Decisions through Affordance-Based Modeling of Social Network Features\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This, in turn, requires advanced test solutions that have to respond to challenges posed by automotive parts. This paper presents Stellar BIST - a deterministic two-level compression scheme for in-system automotive test. The proposed solution seamlessly integrates with any sequential test compression scheme and takes advantage of the fact that certain clusters of test vectors detect many random-resistant faults where a cluster consists of a parent pattern and its transformed derivatives. Stellar BIST involves generating vectors based on simultaneous and multiple complements of scan slices of encodable parent patterns. The multiple complements are also skewed between successive patterns to diversify the resultant tests. The new scheme elevates compression to values unachievable through conventional reseeding-based solutions and provides significant trade-offs between area and time, critical for in-system automotive applications. Experimental results obtained for large industrial designs with stuck-at and transition faults illustrate feasibility of the proposed test scheme and are reported herein.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "11111", "output": "Action Observation with Speed Discrepancy: Exploring the Influence of Lateralized ERD Suppression in the Human Mirror Neuron System", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The activation of hMNS response to action observation remains controversial for several reasons. Researches have found the influence of different speed factor for brain\u2019s ERD suppression, but lack of exploring the influence of different speed discrepancy of left and right movements. To explore how is the discrepancy movements of left and right under different speeds influence ERD suppression, this paper invited six healthy subjects to participate action observation experiment under four different speeds (low, moderate, fast, and finalistic). Meanwhile, four different discrepancy speed ratios of movements are applied for such four different speeds to explore the influence of speed discrepancy on the left and right for the hMNS lateralized modulation effect. For the recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals under different action observation stimulus, this paper selected the occipital and sensorimotor brain regions and used the convolutional neural network to classify EEG signals and measure the ERD suppression. Experimental results have shown that the action observation stimulus with different speed discrepancies improved the lateralized activity during low and moderate speeds, and significantly improved the lateralized activity than non-discrepancy during fast and finalistic speeds. We also analyzed the temporal, spectral, and classification characteristics for speed discrepancy, and discussed that the stimulus material design with speed discrepancy could greatly improve the lateralized modulation of ERD suppression. Action observation material with speed discrepancy of left and right movements could generate significant ERD suppression differences on lateralization of the brain, which could be used to build a more complex and robust brain-computer interface.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.68}, {"id": "11112", "output": "Understanding the Adoption of Program Transformation Languages in Industry: A Survey-Based Analysis of Developer Familiarity, Comfort, and Refactoring Habits.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The results show that while source code transformation languages can fill a needed niche in refactoring, research must motivate their application.

Fuzzy logic was an extension of Boolean logic so that it allowed using not only Boolean values to express reality. One kind of basic logical operations in fuzzy logic are so- called fuzzy implications. From over eight decades a number of different fuzzy implications have been described [3] - [16]. In the family of all fuzzy implications the partial order induced from [0,1] interval exists. Pairs of incomparable fuzzy implications can generate new fuzzy implications by using min (in f) and max (sup) operations. As a result the structure of lattice is created ([1], page 186). This leads to the following question: how to choose the correct functions among basic fuzzy implications and other generated as described above. In our paper, we propose a new method for choosing implications. Our method allows to compare two fuzzy implications. If the truth value of the antecedent and the truth value of the implication are given, by means of inverse fuzzy implications we can easily optimize the truth value of the implication consequent. In other words, we can choose the fuzzy implication, which has the greatest or the smallest truth value of the implication consequent or which has greater or smaller truth value than another implication. Primary results regarding this problem are included in the paper [14].\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.34}, {"id": "11116", "output": "\"Robust High-Resolution DOA Estimation via Robust Steering Vector Estimation for Imperfect Arrays\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Robust DOA Estimation via Robust Steering Vector Estimation\", \"High-Resolution DOA Estimation with Array Pre-Calibration\"]\n\n<features>\n\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

When the basis matrix of a sparse DOA estimation framework is derived from an ideal model, array errors cannot be handled which causes performance deterioration. Array pre-calibration via robust steering vector estimation yields an improved overcomplete basis matrix. It alleviates the delicate problem of selecting the regularization parameter of the optimization problem and improves the performance significantly. Thus, closely spaced sources can be resolved in the presence of severe array imperfections, even at low SNRs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.12}, {"id": "11117", "output": "\"Enhancing Situational Awareness in Nuclear Power Plants through Expert Supervisory Systems for Human-Machine Interface Monitoring\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While assessing the feasibility of the proposed framework, we reflect on implementation challenges and review key enabling state-of-the-art technologies for EYE-on-HMI framework.

Many further problems can be solved by SAT Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers, which extend SAT solvers to handle additional types of constraints. However, building efficient SMT solvers is often very difficult. In this paper, we define the concept of a Boolean monotonic theory and show how to easily build efficient SMT solvers, including effective theory propagation and clause learning, for such theories. We present examples showing useful constraints that are monotonic, including many graph properties (e.g., shortest paths), and geometric properties (e.g., convex hulls). These constraints arise in problems that are otherwise difficult for SAT solvers to handle, such as procedural content generation. We have implemented several monotonic theory solvers using the techniques we present in this paper and applied these to content generation problems, demonstrating major speed-ups over SAT, SMT, and Answer Set Programming solvers, easily solving instances that were previously out of reach.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "11119", "output": "Interactive Exploration of 3D Image-Based Reconstructions: A Hybrid Approach to Orbiting and Feedback Provision for Point-of-Interest Visualization", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we consider a particular virtual travel maneuver that is important for this type of virtual navigation---orbiting to photos that can see a point-of-interest (POI). The main challenge with this particular type of orbiting is how to give appropriate feedback to the user regarding the existence and information of each photo in 3D while allowing the user to manipulate three degrees-of-freedom (DoF) for orbiting around the POI. We present a hybrid approach that combines features from two baselines---proxy plane and thumbnail approaches. Experimental results indicate that users rated our hybrid approach more favorably for several qualitative questionnaire statements, and that the hybrid approach is preferred over both baselines for outdoor scenes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "11120", "output": "\"Unlocking Natural Conversations in Fashion Retail: A Human-Centric Approach to Interactive Image Retrieval\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we introduce the Fashion IQ dataset to support and advance research on interactive fashion image retrieval. Fashion IQ is the first fashion dataset to provide human-generated captions that distinguish similar pairs of garment images together with side-information consisting of real-world product descriptions and derived visual attribute labels for these images. We provide a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the Fashion IQ data, and present a transformer-based user simulator and interactive image retriever that can seamlessly integrate visual attributes with image features, user feedback, and dialog history, leading to improved performance over the state of the art in dialogbased image retrieval. We believe that our dataset will encourage further work on developing more natural and realworld applicable conversational shopping assistants.(1)\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "11121", "output": "\"Optimizing Physical and Cognitive Function in Elderly Populations through Exergaming: A Proof-of-Concept Study\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The framework is divided into kinematic mapping and quadratic programming based whole-body inverse kinematics. In the kinematic mapping, the human motion obtained through a data acquisition device is transformed into a reference motion that is suitable for the robot to follow. To address differences in the kinematic configuration and dynamic properties of the robot and human, quadratic programming is used to calculate the joint angles of the robot considering self-collision, joint limits, and dynamic stability. To address dynamic stability, we use constraints based on the divergent component of motion and zero moment point in the linear inverted pendulum model. Simulation using Choreonoid and a locomotion experiment using the HUBO2+ demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework. The proposed framework has the potential to reduce the preview time or offline task computation time found in previous approaches and hence improve the similarity of human and robot motion while maintaining stability.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "11123", "output": "\"Formalizing Interactive MAPE Components with the MAPE Specification Language (MSL): A Front-end for Self-Adaptive System Design\"\n\nor\n\n\"MAPE Specification Language (MSL): A Domain-Specific Language for Modeling and Executable Specification of Interactive MAPE Patterns\"\n\nor\n\n\"Defining and Exec", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In case of large, complex and decentralized systems, multiple interacting MAPE loops are introduced. Some common design patterns of interactive MAPE components have been proposed in the literature; however, a well-defined way to document them and to express the semantics of their interactions is still missing. This paper presents a domain-specific language, MAPE Specification Language (MSL), as modeling front-end to define and instantiate common patterns of interacting MAPE components when architecting the adaptation logic of a self-adaptive system. We also provide a semantic mapping (implemented by a model generator) to transform MSL descriptions of MAPE pattern instances into formal executable models based on the formalism of self-adaptive Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Such a mapping provides a link to the modeling back-end of ASMs for formally specifying and analyzing the behavior of instances of MAPE patterns.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "11124", "output": "\"Determining the Number of Clusters in Ensemble Radial Basis Function Networks via the Chinese Restaurant Process for Radar Data Analysis\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A set of radial basis function networks is one of the most popular method as a base classifier. However, considering that the unsupervised method including clustering is frequently applied in the learning schemes of the radial basis function networks, there is an important issue to solve that the number of cluster must be determined in advance. Most of partitional clustering algorithms including k-means clustering are sensitive to the number of clusters. In this paper, we replace the k-means clustering algorithm in the learning scheme into the Chinese restaurant process, which does not need to determine the number of cluster. With real problems in the radar data analysis, the proposed method shows better results in the experiment.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "11125", "output": "\"Automating 3D Content Creation: A Machine Learning Approach to Bridging the Gap between 2D and 3D Technologies\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Each agent wants to obtain exactly one resource. Both agents and resources are spatially located on a road network and the movement of the agents is constrained to the road network. This problem applies to various transportation applications including: vehicles (agents) searching for parking (resources) and taxicabs (agents) searching for clients to pick up (resources). In this work, we design search algorithms for such scenarios. We model the problem in different scenarios that vary based on the level of information that is available to the agents. These scenarios vary from scenarios in which agents have complete information about other agents and resources, to scenarios in which agents only have access to a fraction of the data about the availability of resources (uncertain data). We also propose pricing schemes that incentivize vehicles to search for resources in a way that benefits the system and the environment. Our proposed algorithms were tested in a simulation environment that uses real-world data. We were able to attain up to 40% improvements over other approaches that were tested against our algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "11127", "output": "\"Coordinated Routing and Caching for Scalable Named Data Networking: A Comparative Study of CoRC and Vanilla NDN\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

NDN allows in-network caching as a built-in functionality; however, if network nodes make caching decisions individually, duplicate copies of the same content may exist among nearby nodes. To address these problems, we propose Coordinated Routing and Caching (CoRC) that mitigates routing scalability and enhances the efficiency of the in-network storage. CoRC aligns the routing and caching mechanisms to manage the same content namespace for better performance. We evaluate CoRC (and its variants) with Vanilla NDN in terms of the cache hit ratio, hop count, and traffic load by running software routers on Amazon EC2. To demonstrate the feasibility of CoRC, we also implement and test the processing time of CoRC forwarding in Linux machines.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "11128", "output": "\"Unveiling Coherence through Conversational Discourse: An Unsupervised Joint Model for Microblog Topic Extraction\"\n\nor\n\n\"Conversational Contextualization for Effective Topic Modeling: A Joint Approach to Microblog Message Analysis\"\n\nor\n\n\"Rooted in Conversational Dynamics: A Novel Unsupervised Framework for", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To address this issue, we organize microblog messages as conversation trees based on their reposting and replying relations, and propose an unsupervised model that jointly learns word distributions to represent: 1 different roles of conversational discourse, and 2 various latent topics in reflecting content information. By explicitly distinguishing the probabilities of messages with varying discourse roles in containing topical words, our model is able to discover clusters of discourse words that are indicative of topical content. In an automatic evaluation on large-scale microblog corpora, our joint model yields topics with better coherence scores than competitive topic models from previous studies. Qualitative analysis on model outputs indicates that our model induces meaningful representations for both discourse and topics. We further present an empirical study on microblog summarization based on the outputs of our joint model. The results show that the jointly modeled discourse and topic representations can effectively indicate summary-worthy content in microblog conversations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "11129", "output": "\"Cooperative Cellular-D2D Networks: Harnessing Device-to-Device Connections for Enhanced Throughput and Efficiency\"\n\nor\n\"Opportunistic D2D Connections for Cooperative Cellular Networks: A Promising Approach to Meet Increasing Throughput Demand\"\n\nor\n\"Device-to-Device Networking in Cellular Environments: Joint Operation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We encourage the analysis of eye movements as an unobtrusive and widely available way to measure cognitive load. In this paper, we report initial findings from a user study with 26 participants working on three visual search tasks that represent different levels of difficulty. Also, we linearly increased the cognitive demand while solving the tasks. This allowed us to analyze the reaction of individual eye movements to different levels of task difficulty. Our results show how pupil dilation, blink rate, and the number of fixations and saccades per second individually react to changes in cognitive activity. We discuss how these measurements could be combined in future work to allow for a comprehensive investigation of cognitive load in interactive settings.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "11131", "output": "\"Compact 3D LIDAR Sensor for Unmanned Aerial and Ground Vehicles: A Low-Cost, High-Performance Solution\"\n\nor\n\n\"A Novel, Contactless-Driven 3D LIDAR System for Compact and Lightweight Applications\"\n\nor\n\n\"Miniaturized 3D LIDAR for", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It has been challenging for researchers to find an optimal scalable solution for it. Self-healing is based on redundancy by adding spare cells to replace faulty cells when needed for recovery which makes an area overhead. One of main problem in current self-healing approaches is area overhead because they are based on redundancy (spare blocks). This paper presents an idea for self-healing without using redundancy through embryonic hardware where each cell is a universal cell. Therefore, the area overhead will be lower compared to previous works. The idea is based on using every active block as a spare cell for its neighbor through time multiplexing. In case of faulty cell, the neighbor cell will run its task as well as the task of the faulty cell successively in one clock cycle. The area overhead of the proposed technique is shown to be much lower than compared other approaches relying on spare cells. The proposed solution provides 50% chance of repairing.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "11135", "output": "Wireless Live TV (WiLiTV): A Cost-Efficient Architecture for High-Definition TV Content Distribution", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The VS application constitutes key video and image analytic elements that are processed by embedded systems aboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Real-time performance and energy constraints motivate the consideration of approximations to the VS algorithm. However, mission-critical UAV applications also demand stringent levels of resilience to soft errors that are exacerbated with higher altitude. In this work, we study the effects of three different types of software approximations on the application level resiliency (to soft errors) of the VS algorithm. We show that our approximations yield significant energy savings (up to 68%), with commensurate improvement in performance, without a degradation in the application resilience. Further, by proposing a novel quality metric (appropriate for the UAV vision analytics domain) for the summarized video output, we show that even though the rate of Silent Data Corruptions (SDCs) increases slightly (<2%), the impact of these SDCs on output quality is limited. Thus, we conclude that software approximation can be utilized to achieve significant gains in performance and energy without affecting application resiliency.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "11137", "output": "\"Energy Harvesting for Wireless Sensor Networks: Enabling the Exponential Growth of M2M Applications\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We use the depth sensors for both hands in real time music playing. In line with the development of 3D depth cameras, we implemented a set of 3D gesture-based instruments, such as Virtual Cello and Virtual Piano, which need precise finger tracking in 3D space. For hands tracking, model-based tracking for left hand and appearance-based tracking for right hand techniques are proposed. To detect finger gestures, our approaches consist number of systematic steps as reducing noise in depth map and geometrical processing for Virtual Cello. For Virtual Piano, we introduce the Neural Network (NN) method to detect special hand gestures. It has Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) structure with back propagation training.

We use Senz3D and Leap Motion due to a few technical benefits. Senz3D and Leap Motion use a closer distance to hands, thus detailed finger gestures can be precisely identified. In the past years, we announced a set of virtual musical instruments and the MINE Virtual Band. Our research work is tested on lab environment and professional theatrical stage.

Expert knowledge elicitation can help, and a strong line of work focuses on directly eliciting informative prior distributions for parameters. This either requires considerable statistical expertise or is laborious, as the emphasis has been on accuracy and not on efficiency of the process. Another line of work queries about importance of features one at a time, assuming them to be independent and hence missing covariance information. In contrast, we propose eliciting expert knowledge about pairwise feature similarities, to borrow statistical strength in the predictions, and using sequential decision making techniques to minimize the effort of the expert. Empirical results demonstrate improvement in predictive performance on both simulated and real data, in high-dimensional linear regression tasks, where we learn the covariance structure with a Gaussian process, based on sequential elicitation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "11140", "output": "\"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Spatial Digital Twin Development for Enhanced Safety Performance Evaluation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

By taking into consideration of the requirement on dynamic adaptability and incorporating the factors of insufficient conglomerate and incentive mechanisms in trust evaluation, we propose in this paper a dynamic trust evaluation model based on multiple factors that is suitable for open networks. In the proposed model, trust evaluation takes into consideration of direct trust that includes historical information to improve accuracy and recommendation trust that includes a bonus-penalty factor and the reliability of evaluation to improve reliability and efficiency. The calculation of integrated trust relies on solving the problem of determining the weights between direct trust and recommendation trust, resulting in a balanced weight factor being introduced into trust evaluation. In the interactions between network entities, the balanced weight factor changes dynamically as the interactions continue between the entities to make trust evaluation dynamically adaptable. Experimental results show that the proposed method can resist attacks from hostile entities, lower the influence of inaccurate or false recommendations from hostile entities and improve the accuracy of trust evaluation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "11143", "output": "\"Assessing the Validity of Competency Question-Driven Ontology Authoring: An Exploration of CQOA's Representational Accuracy\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Assessing the Validity of Competency Question-Driven Ontology Authoring\", \"Evaluating the Representational Power of CQOA in", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In addition, the medical institutions and companies who own these medical information systems wish to keep their models private when in use by outside parties. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computation over encrypted medical data while ensuring data privacy. In this paper we use private-key fully homomorphic encryption to design a cryptographic protocol for private Naive Bayes classification. This protocol allows a data owner to privately classify his or her information without direct access to the learned model. We apply this protocol to the task of privacy-preserving classification of breast cancer data as benign or malignant. Our results show that private-key fully homomorphic encryption is able to provide fast and accurate results for privacy-preserving medical classification.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "11145", "output": "\"Optimizing Button Activation: A Novel Approach to Enhanced Timeliness in Gaming and Music Interfaces\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Regular buttons are activated during the downward stroke, which occurs within the first 20 ms of a press. The remaining portion, which can be as long as 80 ms, has not been examined for button activation for reason of mechanical limitations. The paper presents a technique and empirical evidence for an activation technique called Impact Activation, where the button is activated at its maximal impact point. We argue that this technique is advantageous particularly in rapid, repetitive button pressing, which is common in gaming and music applications. We report on a study of rapid button pressing, wherein users' timing accuracy improved significantly with use of Impact Activation. The technique can be implemented for modern push-buttons and capacitive sensors that generate a continuous signal.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "11146", "output": "\"Probabilistic Mixture-Based Person Detection for Real-Time Applications\"\n\nor \n\n\"A Probabilistic Approach to Unsupervised Scene Modeling for Enhanced Person Detection\"\n\nor \n\n\"Real-Time Person Detection via Unsupervised Scene Modeling and Mixture Sampling\"\n\nor \n\n\"Mixture Distribution Modeling for Real-Time Person Detection in Probabil", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

WCN have three intrinsic characteristics that make forwarding faults more likely: inexpensive equipment, non-expert administration and openness. These characteristics hinder the robustness of network connectivity. We present KDet, a decentralized protocol for the detection of forwarding faults by establishing overlapping logical boundaries that monitor the behavior of the routers within them. KDet is designed to be collusion resistant, ensuring that compromised routers cannot cover for others to avoid detection. Another important characteristic of KDet is that it does not rely on path information: monitoring nodes do not have to know the complete path a packet follows, just the previous and next hop. As a result, KDet can be deployed as an independent daemon without imposing any change in the network, and it will bring improved network robustness. Results from theoretical analysis and simulation show the correctness of the algorithm, its accuracy in detecting forwarding faults, and a comparison in terms of cost and advantages over previous work, that confirms its practical feasibility in WCN.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "11148", "output": "\"Depth-Based 3D Facial Pose Tracking and Face Model Adaptation: A Unified Framework for Robust and Adaptive Recognition in Occluded Scenarios\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Specifically, we introduce a statistical 3D morphable model that flexibly describes the distribution of points on the surface of the face model, with an efficient switchable online adaptation that gradually captures the identity of the tracked subject and rapidly constructs a suitable face model when the subject changes. Moreover, unlike prior art that employed ICP-based facial pose estimation, to improve robustness to occlusions, we propose a ray visibility constraint that regularizes the pose based on the face model's visibility with respect to the input point cloud. Ablation studies and experimental results on Biwi and ICT-3DHP datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective and outperforms completing state-of-the-art depth-based methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "11149", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Real-Time Rendering of Complex Scenes\", \"Efficient Global Illumination for Large-Scale Environments\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- Use of \"scalable solution\" to convey innovative approach\n- Mention of \"sublinear performance", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper we adopt an MPEG-21 representation of digital contents and propose a system that supports the users in their composition that takes into account the permissions of access/composition/modification that each single user or group can exercise on them. In our environment, users can retrieve digital content and data, check the authoring privileges that can be executed on the component resources to generate composite and aggregated contents, and verify the situations in which the composition can hide some privileges that exist in the original contents. When the user holds the privileges for the composition, a license can be automatically generated for the composite content that preserves the rights the user/group holds on the components. This environment supports collaboration among users belonging to different organizations that would like to work together in the realization of non trivial content/data aggregation processes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "11152", "output": "\"Exploring the Impact of Feature Reduction Techniques on Defect Prediction Models: A Comparative Study of Supervised and Unsupervised Approaches\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Most prior work on defect prediction uses software features, such as the number of lines of code, to predict whether a file or commit will be defective in the future. There are several reasons to keep the number of features that are used in a defect prediction model small. For example, using a small number of features avoids the problem of multicollinearity and the so-called \u2018curse of dimensionality\u2019. Feature selection and reduction techniques can help to reduce the number of features in a model. Feature selection techniques reduce the number of features in a model by selecting the most important ones, while feature reduction techniques reduce the number of features by creating new, combined features from the original features. Several recent studies have investigated the impact of feature selection techniques on defect prediction. However, there do not exist large-scale studies in which the impact of multiple feature reduction techniques on defect prediction is investigated. In this paper, we study the impact of eight feature reduction techniques on the performance and the variance in performance of five supervised learning and five unsupervised defect prediction models. In addition, we compare the impact of the studied feature reduction techniques with the impact of the two best-performing feature selection techniques (according to prior work). The following findings are the highlights of our study: (1) The studied correlation and consistency-based feature selection techniques result in the best-performing supervised defect prediction models, while feature reduction techniques using neural network-based techniques (restricted Boltzmann machine and autoencoder) result in the best-performing unsupervised defect prediction models. In both cases, the defect prediction models that use the selected/generated features perform better than those that use the original features (in terms of AUC and performance variance). (2) Neural network-based feature reduction techniques generate features that have a small variance across both supervised and unsupervised defect prediction models. Hence, we recommend that practitioners who do not wish to choose a best-performing defect prediction model for their data use a neural network-based feature reduction technique.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.65}, {"id": "11153", "output": "\"Efficient Continuous Reverse Skyline Query Processing for Mobile Devices\"\n\nor\n\n\"Pruning and Incremental Update for Continuous Reverse Skyline Query Processing in Mobile Environments\"\n\nor\n\n\"Real-time Reverse Skyline Query Processing with Device Mobility Consideration for Mobile Applications\"\n\nor\n\n\"Continuous Reverse Skyline Query Processing with Adaptive", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Elastic instabilities can arise, however, when rotating one precurved tube inside another. In contrast to prior work that considered only tubes of piecewise constant precurvature, we allow precurvature to vary along the tube's arc length. Stability conditions for a planar tube pair are derived and used to formulate an optimal design problem. An analytic formulation of the optimal precurvature function is derived, which achieves a desired tip orientation range while maximizing stability and respecting bending strain limits. This formulation also includes straight transmission segments at the proximal ends of the tubes. The result, confirmed by both numerical and physical experiment, enables designs with enhanced stability in comparison to designs of constant precurvature.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "11155", "output": "Context-aware key-value stores for geographically distributed event-based systems: Overcoming the trade-off between consistency and latency through relevance-based differential consistency guarantees.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Distributed event-based processing pipelines are envisioned to utilize the resources of densely geo-distributed infrastructures for low-latency responses - enabling real-time applications. Increasing complexity of such applications results in higher dependence on state, which has driven the incorporation of state-management as a core functionality of contemporary stream processing engines a la Apache Flink and Samza. Processing components executing under the same context (like location) often produce information that may be relevant to others, thereby necessitating shared state and an out-of-band globally-accessible data-store. Efficient access to application state is critical for overall performance, thus centralized data-stores are not a viable option due to the high-latency of network traversals. On the other hand, a highly geo-distributed datastore with low-latency implemented with current key-value stores would necessitate degrading client expectation of consistency as per the PACELC theorem. In this paper we exploit the notion of contextual relevance of events (data) in situation-awareness applications - and offer differential consistency guarantees for clients based on their context. We highlight important systems concerns that may arise with a highly geo-distributed system and show how Fogstore's design tackles them. We present, in detail, a prototype implementation of Fogstore's mechanisms on Apache Cassandra and a performance evaluation. Our evaluations show that Fogstore is able to achieve the throughput of eventually consistent configurations while serving data with strong consistency to the contextually relevant clients.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "11156", "output": "Structure-Preserving Signature Schemes with Tight Security Reduction: A Compact and Efficient Alternative", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Compared to the state-of-the-art tightly secure SPS scheme of Abe et al. (CRYPTO 2017), our scheme has smaller signatures and public keys (of about 56%, resp. 40% of the size of signatures and public keys in Abe et al.'s scheme), and a lower security loss (of O(logQ) instead of O(lambda), where lambda is the security parameter, and Q = poly(lambda) is the number of adversarial signature queries). While our scheme is still less compact than structure-preserving signature schemes without tight security reduction, it significantly lowers the price to pay for a tight security reduction. In fact, when accounting for a non-tight security reduction with larger key (i.e., group) sizes, the computational efficiency of our scheme becomes at least comparable to that of non-tightly secure SPS schemes. Technically, we combine and refine recent existing works on tightly secure encryption and SPS schemes. Our technical novelties include a modular treatment (that develops an SPS scheme out of a basic message authentication code), and a refined hybrid argument that enables a lower security loss of O(logQ) (instead of O(lambda)).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "11157", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.

However, the existence of data dependences across thread blocks may significantly impact the speedup by requiring global synchronization across multiprocessors (SMs) inside the GPU. To efficiently run applications with interblock data dependences, we need fine-granular task-based execution models that will treat SMs inside a GPU as stand-alone parallel processing units. Such a scheme will enable faster execution by utilizing all internal computation elements inside the GPU and eliminating unnecessary waits during device-wide global barriers.\n\nIn this paper, we propose Juggler, a task-based execution scheme for GPU workloads with data dependences. The Juggler framework takes applications embedding OpenMP 4.5 tasks as input and executes them on the GPU via an efficient in-device runtime, hence eliminating the need for kernel-wide global synchronization. Juggler requires no or little modification to the source code, and once launched, the runtime entirely runs on the GPU without relying on the host through the entire execution. We have evaluated Juggler on an NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU and obtained up to 31% performance improvement against global barrier based implementation, with minimal runtime overhead.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.89}, {"id": "11158", "output": "Learning Weights in Spiking Neural Networks for Non-Linear Control: A Feedback-based Approach to Inverse Model Learning and Continuous-Time Command Generation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Here, we employ a supervised scheme, Feedback-based Online Local Learning Of Weights (FOLLOW), to train a network of heterogeneous spiking neurons with hidden layers, to control a two-link arm so as to reproduce a desired state trajectory. The network first learns an inverse model of the non-linear dynamics, i.e. from state trajectory as input to the network, it learns to infer the continuous-time command that produced the trajectory. Connection weights are adjusted via a local plasticity rule that involves pre-synaptic firing and post-synaptic feedback of the error in the inferred command. We choose a network architecture, termed differential feedforward, that gives the lowest test error from different feedforward and recurrent architectures. The learned inverse model is then used to generate a continuous-time motor command to control the arm, given a desired trajectory.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "11159", "output": "Unmanned Aerial Networks for Disaster Response: Balancing Connectivity and Energy Management", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While many techniques such as transfer functions, volume segmentation or view distortion have been developed to address this, there is still room for improvement to better support the understanding of objects' vicinity. However, most existing Focus+Context fail to solve partial occlusion in datasets where the target and the occluder are very similar density-wise. For these reasons, we investigate a new technique which maintains the general structure of the investigated volumetric dataset while addressing occlusion issues. With our technique, the user interactively defines an area of interest where an occluded region or object is partially visible. Then our lens starts pushing at its border occluding objects, thus revealing hidden volumetric data. Next, the lens is modified with an extended field of view (fish-eye deformation) to better see the vicinity of the selected region. Finally, the user can freely explore the surroundings of the area under investigation within the lens. To provide real-time exploration, we implemented our lens using a GPU accelerated ray-casting framework to handle ray deformations, local lighting, and local viewpoint manipulation. We illustrate our technique with five application scenarios in baggage inspection, 3D fluid flow visualization, chest radiology, air traffic planning, and DTI fiber exploration.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "11163", "output": "\"Reformulating Face Sketch Synthesis via Neural Feature Maps: A 3D PatchMatch and Cross-Layer Optimization Approach\"\n\nor \n\n\"Capturing Hand-Drawn Sketch Style in Face Sketch Synthesis via Enhanced 3D PatchMatch and Cross-Layer Aggregation\"\n\nor \n\n\"Neural Feature Maps Based", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Existing face sketch synthesis methods learn the patch-wise sketch style from the training dataset containing photo-sketch pairs. These methods manipulate the whole process directly in the field of RGB space, which unavoidably results in unsmooth noises at patch boundaries. If denoising methods are used, the sketch edges would be blurred and face structures could not be restored. Recent researches of feature maps, which are the outputs of a certain neural network layer, have achieved great success in texture synthesis and artistic image generation. In this paper, we reformulate the face sketch synthesis problem into a neural network feature maps based optimization task. Our results accurately capture the sketch drawing style and make full use of the whole stylistic information hidden in the training dataset. Unlike former feature map based methods, we utilize the Enhanced 3D PatchMatch and cross-layer cost aggregation methods to obtain the target feature maps for the final results. Multiple experiments have shown that our approach imitates hand-drawn sketch style vividly, and has high-quality visual effects on CUHK, AR, XM2VTS and CUFSF face sketch datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "11164", "output": "\"Cost-Effective Crowdsourced Multiview Live Streaming: A Quality of Experience Driven Resource Allocation Approach\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Advancements in technology and prevalence of video capturing devices result in massive multi-sourced (aka crowdsourced) live video broadcasting over the Internet. A single scene may be captured by multiple spectators from different angles (views), enabling an opportunity for interactive multiview video by integrating these individually captured views. Such multi-sourced multiview video offers more realistic and immersive experience of a scene. In this paper, we present a Quality of Experience (QoE) driven, cost effective Crowdsourced Multiview Live Streaming (CMLS) system. The CMLS aims to minimize the overall system cost by selecting optimal cloud site for video transcoding and the number of representations, based on the view popularity and viewer's available bandwidth. In addition, we present a QoE metric considering delay and received video quality. We formulate the selection of optimal cloud site and number of representations to meet the required QoE as a resource allocation problem using Integer Programming (IP). Moreover, we present a Greedy Minimal Cost (GMC) algorithm to perform resource allocation efficiently. We use real live video traces collected from three large-scale live video providers (Twitch.tv, YouTube Live, and YouNow) to evaluate our proposed strategy. We evaluate the GMC algorithm considering the overall cost, QoE, video quality, and average latency between viewers and transcoding location. We compare our results with the optimal solution and the state-of-the art policy used in a popular video steaming system. Our results demonstrate that the GMC achieves near optimal results and substantially outperforms the state-of-the art policy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "11165", "output": "Based on the provided abstract, I will generate a title using the similar abstract-title pairs and features.\n\nTitle: Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks with Modular Decomposition Strategies", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Therefore inferring the GRN is crucial to studying diseases related to malfunctioning of the cell. Even with high-throughput technology, time series expression data is still limited compared to the network size, which poses significant challenge to inferring large GRN. Since GRNs are known to be modular, or hierarchically modular, we propose to exploit this by first inferring an initial GRN using CLINDE, then decomposing it into possibly overlapping subnetworks, then re-learning the subnetworks using either CLINDE or DD-lasso, and lastly merging the subnetworks. We have performed extensive experiments on synthetic data to test this strategy on both modular and hierarchically modular networks with 500 and 1000 genes, using either a long time series or several short time series. Results show that the strategy does improve GRN inference with statistical significance. Also, the algorithm is robust to different variance and slight deviation of Gaussianity for the error terms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "11166", "output": "\"Mitigating Agile Paradoxes: A Conceptual Model for Waste Creation in Dependable Software Development\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Nevertheless, we experienced some pitfalls in the application of agile processes in dependable software systems. We present here the experiences we gathered in the construction of high-quality industrial software. Moreover, we will digest our experiences into a conceptual model of waste creation. This model will be refined to a case study where we take appropriate measurements in order to provide empirical evidence for it. Finally, we discuss the implications of the developed model, which helps to estimate the trade-off between agile and traditional software processes.

It greatly facilitates static Web content distribution due to its information-centric communication paradigm, novel in-network caching, and name-based routing features. However, NDN still lacks efficient support for dynamic Web applications. Specifically, the inefficient communications are attributed to inherent features of NDN, such as its being multisource and multicast, as well as its decoupling of content from location. A dynamic Web request generally includes dozens of Interest packets. Since NDN lacks efficient support for the session persistence of dynamic Web applications, existing name-based forwarding strategies cannot effectively forward those Interest packets that belong to the same session to the specific server in cases where multiple server clusters are deployed by the Application Service Provider (ASP). This, therefore, leads to the packet retransmission problem: retransmitted Interest packets waste network resources and degrade the performance of dynamic Web applications. How to effectively maintain session persistence is worth considering for an NDN network. To this end, we design and implement a system framework that aims to enhance dynamic Web applications over NDN through a session-oriented approach. First, we propose a session-based forwarding model that maintains a virtual connection during an online interaction. Second, we design a robust forwarding scheme that can balance the dynamic content traffic with a fault recovery capability. Finally, we implement our approach and conduct experiments on the ndnSIM, network topology in the simulation is designed based on the China Education and Research Network 2. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves network utilization and reduces the service delay, i.e., 90.36%, 50.23% utilization improvement and 84.83%, 45.68% service delay reduction, respectively, compared with two existing approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "11168", "output": "\"Simultaneous Relational Discovery and Behavior Learning for Autonomous Decision-Making\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These individual problems do not provide enough parallelism and then, these must be computed as a batch. Today, vendors such as Intel and NVIDIA are developing their own suite of batch routines. Although most of the works focus on computing batches of fixed size, in real applications we can not assume a uniform size for all set of problems. We explore and analyze different strategies based on parallel for, task and taskloop OpenMP pragmas. Although these strategies are straightforward from a programmer's point of view, they have a different impact on performance. We also analyze a new prototype provided by Intel (MKL), which deals with batch operations (cblas_dgemm_batch). We propose a new approach called grouping. It basically groups a set of problems until filling a limit in terms of memory occupancy or number of operations. In this way, groups composed by different number of problems are distributed on cores, achieving a more balanced distribution in terms of computational cost. This strategy is able to be up to 6\u00d7 faster than the Intel (MKL) batch routine.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "11170", "output": "\"Enhancing File Access Security in Virtual Machines: A Novel Approach to Redirection and Policy-Based Protection\"\n\nor \n\n\"Transparent and Tamper-Resistant File Access Redirection in Virtual Machines: A Gemini Framework\"\n\nor \n\n\"Redirection and Protection of Sensitive Files in Virtual Machines: A Study on Gemini's Security", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For the same level of localization accuracy, the loss in performance due to Rayleigh fading with known phase is shown to be about 5dB compared to the case with no fading. Unknown phase causes an additional 1dB loss.

Existing works mainly rely on the kinematic equations for UAV\u2019s mobility modeling, while its dynamic equations are usually missing. As a result, the planned UAV trajectories are piece-wise line segments in general, which may be difficult to implement in practice. By leveraging the concept of state-space model, a control-based UAV trajectory design is proposed in this paper, which takes into account both of the UAV\u2019s kinematic equations and the dynamic equations. Consequently, smooth trajectories that are amenable to practical implementation can be obtained. Moreover, the UAV\u2019s controller design is achieved along with the trajectory optimization, where practical roll angle and pitch angle constraints are considered. Furthermore, a new energy consumption model is derived for quad-rotor UAVs, which is based on the voltage and current flows of the electric motors and thus captures both the consumed energy for motion and the energy conversion efficiency of the motors. Numerical results are provided to validate the derived energy consumption model and show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "11174", "output": "\"Shadows in AR: A Tradeoff Between Photorealism and Depth Perception Accuracy\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Shadows in AR\", \"Depth Perception in AR Displays\", \"Augmented Reality Rendering Techniques\", \"Spatial Perception in AR\"]\n\n<features>\n\nwordcloud:\n  - cast\n  - shadows\n  -", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In the current study, we examine how the way we render cast shadows\u2013which act as an important monocular depth cue for creating a sense of contact between an object and the surface beneath it\u2013impacts spatial perception. Over two experiments, we evaluate people's sense of surface contact given both traditional and non-traditional shadow shading methods in optical see-through augmented reality (OST AR), video see-through augmented reality (VST AR), and virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays. Our results provide evidence that nontraditional shading techniques for rendering shadows in AR displays may enhance the accuracy of one's perception of surface contact. This finding implies a possible tradeoff between photorealism and accuracy of depth perception, especially in OST AR displays. However, it also supports the use of more stylized graphics like non-traditional cast shadows to improve perception and interaction in AR applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "11175", "output": "Scalable Payment Services through Service Line Engineering: Mapping Nonfunctional Requirements to Horizontal and Vertical Scalability", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the interaction between horizontal scalability, feature variability and stringent performance and security concerns for these heterogeneous payment applications and stakeholders is not always cleat; which creates tension (and sometimes interference) in the successful development of these services. In this work, we identify crucial nonfunctional requirements for payment services and present a simple framework to map these requirements to existing approaches to achieve both horizontal and vertical scalability. We report on experiences with applying a service line engineering (SLE) approach towards payment services that combines cloud computing and SPL to support feature customization in a multi tenant payment service. We conclude with practical experiences and several lessons learned after applying this SPL engineering methodology on our industrial e-payment use case.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "11176", "output": "Temporal and Spatial Query Optimization for Large-Scale Knowledge Graphs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The efficiency of SPARQL querying on large-scale knowledge graphs has attracted increasing research efforts. In this paper, we propose a template-based query approach, which involves temporal, spatial, and domain-specific constraints to focus on certain resources of interest. Furthermore, query results which include a set of RDF triples are visualized in graph format to display entities and relationships in a user-friendly manner. We also analyze the visualized graph with ranking, partitioning, filtering, and statistics. Various template-based queries are designed and evaluated on the knowledge graph of DBpedia. It can be observed that template-based queries with temporal-spatial and domain-specific constraints can effectively facilitate users to obtain target answers by filtering out irrelevant information.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.28}, {"id": "11177", "output": "\"Integrating Model-Driven Engineering and Collective Adaptive Systems: A Domain-Specific Language for Comprehensive Design\"\n\nor\n\n\"CAStlE: A Unified Approach to Collective Adaptive System Design through a Domain-Specific Language\"\n\nor\n\n\"Enabling Holistic Collective Adaptive System Design with CAStlE: A DSL", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These three separate aspects are woven seamlessly by the DSL to constitute a complete CAS design. Moreover, each of the defined views conveys the creation of a corresponding model editor, which allows for the three aspects of a CAS to be independently designed by CAStlE.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "11178", "output": "Plane Formation in Three-Dimensional Euclidean Space: A Necessary and Sufficient Condition for Fully Synchronous Robots", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Motivated by this, we investigate the plane formation problem that requires a swarm of robots moving in the three-dimensional Euclidean space to land on a common plane. The robots are fully synchronous and endowed with visual perception. But they do not have identifiers, nor access to the global coordinate system, nor any means of explicit communication with each other. Though there are plenty of results on the agreement problem for robots in the two-dimensional plane, for example, the point formation problem, the pattern formation problem, and so on, this is the first result for robots in the three-dimensional space. This article presents a necessary and sufficient condition for fully synchronous robots to solve the plane formation problem that does not depend on obliviousness, i.e., the availability of local memory at robots. An implication of the result is somewhat counter-intuitive: The robots cannot form a plane from most of the semi-regular polyhedra, while they can form a plane from every regular polyhedron (except a regular icosahedron), whose symmetry is usually considered to be higher than any semi-regular polyhedron.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "11179", "output": "\"Enhancing Image Quality via Hybrid CSC-CNN and ACSC Approaches: A Comparative Study\"\n\nor \n\n\"Super-Resolution Enhancement via Cascaded Sparse Coding and Convolutional Neural Networks: A Novel ACSC Method\"\n\nor \n\n\"Advancing Image Resolution with Hybrid CSC-CNN and ACSC: A Comprehensive Investigation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In order to reflect this evolution of knowledge, KBs should be expanded with the new knowledge and contracted from the obsolete one. This problem is well-studied for propositional but much less for first-order KBs. In this work we investigate knowledge expansion and contraction for KBs expressed in DL-Lite, a family of description logics (DLs) that underlie the tractable fragment OWL2QL of the Web Ontology Language OWL2. We start with a novel knowledge evolution framework and natural postulates that evolution should respect, and compare our postulates to the well-established AGM postulates. We then review well-known model and formula-based approaches for expansion and contraction for propositional theories and show how they can be adapted to the case of DL-Lite. In particular, we show intrinsic limitations of model-based approaches: besides the fact that some of them do not respect the postulates we have established, they ignore the structural properties of KBs. This leads to undesired properties of evolution results: evolution of DL-Lite KBs cannot be captured in DL-Lite. Moreover, we show that well-known formula-based approaches are also not appropriate for DL-Lite expansion and contraction: they either have a high complexity of computation, or they produce logical theories that cannot be expressed in DL-Lite. Thus, we propose a novel formula-based approach that respects our principles and for which evolution is expressible in DL-Lite. For this approach we also propose polynomial time deterministic algorithms to compute evolution of DL-Lite KBs when evolution affects only factual data.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.18}, {"id": "11181", "output": "Contextualizing Community Formation in the Internet of People: A Framework for Altruistic and Resource-Conscious Collaborative Computing", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The Internet of People (IoP) is a recent paradigm where devices become proxies of their users, and can act on their behalf. To realize IoP, new policies and rules for how devices can take actions are required. The role of context information grows as devices act autonomously based on the environment and existing social relationships between their owners. In addition, the social profiles of device owners determine e.g. how altruistic or resource-conserving they are in collaborative computing scenarios. In this paper we focus on community formation in IoP, a prerequisite for enabling collaborative scenarios, and discuss main challenges and propose potential solutions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "11182", "output": "\"Quantifying the Impact of Cryptographic Vulnerabilities on Web Application Security: A Systematic Evaluation of HTTPS Weaknesses\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, HTTPS is based on the SSL/TLS protocol suites that have been shown to be vulnerable to various attacks in the years. This has required fixes and mitigations both in the servers and in the browsers, producing a complicated mixture of protocol versions and implementations in the wild, which makes it unclear which attacks are still effective on the modern Web and what is their import on web application security. In this paper, we present the first systematic quantitative evaluation of web application insecurity due to cryptographic vulnerabilities. We specify attack conditions against TLS using attack trees and we crawl the Alexa Top 10k to assess the import of these issues on page integrity, authentication credentials and web tracking. Our results show that the security of a consistent number of websites is severely harmed by cryptographic weaknesses that, in many cases, are due to external or related-domain hosts. This empirically, yet systematically demonstrates how a relatively limited number of exploitable HTTPS vulnerabilities are amplified by the complexity of the web ecosystem.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "11183", "output": "\"Global Contrast Analysis of Spatial Distribution: A Novel Approach to Saliency Measurement\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A rotational motion is leveraged, which can be detected by built-in motion sensors in most smartwatches, as input to provide item selection. Users control a cursor by rotating the smartwatch into different orientations using the proposed item selection gestures. To understand human wrist dexterity and the ability to perform rotational motion input along each degree of freedom on smartwatches, a human-factor study was performed. Except dexterity, users' consensus and agreement of user-defined rotational motion input gestures for selection and commitment on smartwatches in an exploratory user study were also observed. Based on both the studies, gestures roll and tilt are proposed as selection gestures, and shake and nod are used as commitment gestures. The item selection performance using the proposed gestures in 2D layouts in a user study was further evaluated. The study results showed that tilt-nod and tilt-shake are suitable for item numbers (4x3) and (5x5), respectively. Furthermore, due to high error rate for tilt-shake in (2x2) caused by false positive in shake detection, roll-shake with better social acceptance can be used as an alternative for smartwatches without a built-in front camera in (2x2).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "11185", "output": "\"Electromagnetic Crosstalk in SoC Design: A Shift from Capacitive to Magnetic Coupling Considerations\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The approach involves formulation of whole word point process model based on word specific spectral peak event in selected groups of mel banks. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on an isolated word recognizer on noisy speech samples (additive white Gaussian noise) at different SNR levels ranging from 0 dB to clean speech. The training is carried out with examples varying from 5 to 80. Performance comparison with HMM based system trained with mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features show an improvement of 8\u201317% (absolute) depending on SNR level when the number of training examples are less than 10. Since the approach relies only on positions and magnitudes of spectral peaks derived from spoken word examples without any language specific resources, the same can potentially be applied for any language. It is also shown that our approach recognizes those words better that are poorly recognized by HMMs across all SNR levels.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "11188", "output": "\"Unveiling the Enigma of Deep Neural Networks: A Philosophical and Hypothetical Exploration of Dataset Bias and Perturbation in Natural-Image Spaces\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Existing approaches to detect coordinated accounts either make very strict assumptions about coordinated behaviours, or require part of the malicious accounts in the coordinated group to be revealed in order to detect the rest. To address these drawbacks, we propose a generative model, AMDN-HAGE (Attentive Mixture Density Network with Hidden Account Group Estimation) which jointly models account activities and hidden group behaviours based on Temporal Point Processes (TPP) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to capture inherent characteristics of coordination which is, accounts that coordinate must strongly influence each other's activities, and collectively appear anomalous from normal accounts. To address the challenges of optimizing the proposed model, we provide a bilevel optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee on convergence. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method and training algorithm on real-world social network data collected from Twitter related to coordinated campaigns from Russia's Internet Research Agency targeting the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections, and to identify coordinated campaigns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging the learned model, we find that the average influence between coordinated account pairs is the highest. On COVID-19, we found coordinated group spreading anti-vaccination, anti-masks conspiracies that suggest the pandemic is a hoax and political scam.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "11190", "output": "Optimization of Smart Energy Management through Multi-Agent Systems in Shared Photovoltaic Networks: A European CoSSMic Project Overview", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These qualitative properties allow the user to select the most efficient members from the family of iterative schemes, in terms of stability and wideness of the sets of convergent initial guesses. These tools have been widely used in the case of iterative procedures for finding simple roots and only recently are being applied on the case of multiplicity m >\u20091. In this paper, by using weight function procedure, we design a general class of iterative methods for calculating multiple roots that includes some known methods. In this class, conditions on the weight function are not very restrictive, so a large number of different subfamilies can be generated, all of them are optimal with fourth-order of convergence. Their dynamical analysis gives us enough information to select those with better properties and test them on different numerical experiments, showing their numerical properties.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "11192", "output": "\"Enhancing Landmark-Based SLAM with Heterogeneous Representations and Extended Kalman Filtering\"\n\nor\n\n\"Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with Heterogeneous Landmarks: A Study on Extended Kalman Filtering and Landmark Representations\"\n\nor\n\n\"Fusion of Heterogeneous Landmarks in Visual SLAM using", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In classification paradigms, algorithms are developed that can distinguish between these processes. In this work, we apply tensor factorisation to a set of EEG data from a group of epileptic patients and factorise the data into three modes; space, time, and frequency with each mode containing a number of components or signatures. We train separate classifiers on various feature sets corresponding to complementary combinations of those modes and components and test the classification accuracy for each set. The relative influence on the classification accuracy of the respective spatial, temporal, or frequency signatures can then be analysed and useful interpretations can be made. Additionaly, we show that through tensor factorisation we can perform dimensionality reduction by evaluating the classification performance with regards to the number of components in each mode and also by rejecting components with insignificant contribution to the classification accuracy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "11195", "output": "Evaluating and Comparing the Efficacy of Statistical, Transform, Model, and Structural-Based Texture Features for DIR Analysis: A Computational Time Analysis and Comparative Study of 26 Texture Features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Perhaps as a result, little research has focused on younger kids' risk recognition and coping. Such knowledge is, however, critical for designing efficient safeguarding mechanisms for this age group. Through 12 focus group studies with 29 children aged 6-10 from UK schools, we examined how children described privacy risks related to their use of tablet computers and what information was used by them to identify threats. We found that children could identify and articulate certain privacy risks well, such as information oversharing or revealing real identities online; however, they had less awareness with respect to other risks, such as online tracking or game promotions. Our findings offer promising directions for supporting children's awareness of cyber risks and the ability to protect themselves online.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.72}, {"id": "11197", "output": "Blockchain-based Federated Learning with Reputation Mechanism for High-Quality Model Aggregation and Data Contribution Incentives", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Then, how to motivate the data owners to participate federated learning and contribute high-quality data is the crucial issue. In this article, a blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) with a reputation mechanism for high-quality model aggregation is proposed. Specifically, the blockchain transforms the federated learning into a decentralized and trustworthy manner. Over the blockchain, federated learning tasks, undertaken by smart contracts, can be conducted transparently and fairly. Besides, a reputation-constrained data contribution and reward allocation mechanism is designed to encourage data owners to participate in BFL and contribute high-quality data. The noncooperative game is adopted to analyze the behavior strategies of data owners. The existence of the unique equilibrium is proved and the equilibrium point indicates that the data owners can acquire highest reward with the contribution of the highest quality data. Thus, the model quality of BFL is guaranteed. Finally, simulations on the public data sets (MNIST and CIFAR10) demonstrate that BFL with a reputation mechanism can well promote the high-quality model aggregation of federated learning as well as can prevent malicious nodes from corrupting the training task.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "11198", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title.

A joint registration frame-work is proposed, based on physical Finite Element Method (FEM) elastic and interaction models. It first relies on a visual segmentation of the considered objects in the RGB images. The different segmented point clouds are then processed to estimate rigid transformations with on an ICP algorithm, and to determine geometrical point-to-point correspondences with the meshes. External forces resulting from these correspondences and between the current and the rigidly transformed mesh can then be derived. It provides both non-rigid and rigid data cues. A classical collision detection and response model is also integrated, giving contact forces between the objects. The deformations of the objects are estimated by solving a dynamic system balancing these external and contact forces with the internal or regularization forces computed through the FEM elastic model. This approach has been here tested on different scenarios involving two or three interacting deformable objects of various shapes, with promising results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.9}, {"id": "11199", "output": "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Policy Certificates in Reinforcement Learning: A Novel Approach to Enhance Accountability in High-Stakes Applications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Existing algorithms provide little information about their current policyu0027s quality before executing it, and thus have limited use in high-stakes applications like healthcare. In this paper, we address such a lack of accountability by proposing that algorithms output policy certificates, which upper bound the suboptimality in the next episode, allowing humans to intervene when the certified quality is not satisfactory. We further present a new learning framework (IPOC) for finite-sample analysis with policy certificates, and develop two IPOC algorithms that enjoy guarantees for the quality of both their policies and certificates.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111100", "output": "\"Enabling Scalable Collaboration: A Framework for Engineering Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Incorporating these models and design flows into our previously developed printed design system allows for robust circuit design. Additionally, we propose a reliability-aware routing solution for printed electronics technology based on the technology constraints in printing crossovers. The proposed methodology was validated on multiple benchmark circuits and can be easily integrated with the design automation tools-set.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.13}, {"id": "111102", "output": "Temporal and Spatial Information Extraction via Distant Supervision with Knowledge Graph Embeddings.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Dual optimization algorithms offer a scalable solution and can thus be applied to large distributed systems. Due to constraints on communication or limited computational power, most real-time applications of MPC have to deal with inexact minimization. We propose a modified optimization problem inspired by robust MPC which offers theoretical guarantees despite inexact dual minimization. The approach is not tied to any particular optimization algorithm, but assumes that the feasible optimization problem can be solved with a bounded suboptimality and constraint violation. In combination with a distributed dual gradient method, we obtain a priori upper bounds on the number of required online iterations. The design and practicality of this method are demonstrated with a benchmark numerical example.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111104", "output": "\"Real-Time Coronary Artery Centerline Extraction via Iterative Tracking and Convolutional Neural Network Estimation\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Real-Time Coronary Artery Centerline Extraction\", \"Automated Coronary Artery Centerline Extraction\"],\n[\"Coronary Artery Centerline Extraction via Iterative Tracking\", \"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the proportion of Chinese female practitioners in the computing industry is only about 7 percent, which is lower than 17% in the United States. Chinese women have not fully participated in the computing industry and their talents have not been fully utilized. Furthermore, the low proportion of women in computing is not conducive to gender diversity in the field of computing. As a Chinese idiom states \"Men and women work together, not tired (\"\u7537\u5973\u642d\u914d, \u5e72\u6d3b\u4e0d\u7d2f\")\", meaning that when men and women work together they will be very happy and efficient. In keeping with the Taoist notion of harmony between Yin and Yang we need to promote greater participation of women in computing. In this paper, we will discuss issues related to women in China's computing communities. First, we analyze the reasons for the low proportion of Chinese female practitioners in the computing industry. Then, we discuss measures to improve the computing environment for Chinese female employees. Next, we discuss the interesting phenomenon that the proportion of Chinese women in senior positions and the number of women entrepreneurs is relatively high. Finally, we give some suggestions to improve the ratio of Chinese female practitioners in computing.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111106", "output": "\"Advancements in Optical Flow Estimation: A Systematic Review of Variational Methods and Convolutional Neural Networks\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The proposed watermarking scheme is reversible because the original image can be recovered after extracting watermarks from the watermarked image, as long as it is not processed by an attacker. The scheme is robust because watermarks can still be extracted from watermarked images, even if it is undergone some malicious or normal operations like rotation and JPEG compression. It first selects two circles, which are centred at the centroid and the centre of image. Then, statistic quantities of these two circles are employed for robust watermark embedding by altering the pixels' value. The side information generated by above embedding process will be embedded as fragile watermarks at another stage to ensure the recovery of original image. Experimental results verify the high performance of the proposed algorithm in resisting various attacks, including JPEG compression and geometric transformation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.31}, {"id": "111109", "output": "\"Optimization of Threshold-Based Access Schemes for Mobile Sink Networks with Multi-Antenna Techniques and Rayleigh Fading Channels\"\n\nor \n\n\"Reliability, Security, and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Mobile Sink-Based Communication Networks with Randomly Deployed Receivers and Eavesdroppers\"\n\nor \n\n\"Threshold-Based Access Scheme", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Numerous approaches have been proposed for modeling miRNA-miRNA networks based on genomic sequences, miRNA-mRNA regulation, functional information and phenomics alone, or by integrating heterogeneous data. In addition, it is expected that miRNA-miRNA crosstalk can be reprogrammed in different tissues or specific diseases. Thus, transcriptome data have also been integrated to construct context-specific miRNA-miRNA networks. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art miRNA-miRNA network modeling methods, which range from genomics to phenomics, where we focus on the need to integrate heterogeneous types of omics data. Finally, we suggest future directions for studies of crosstalk of noncoding RNAs. This comprehensive summarization and discussion elucidated in this work provide constructive insights into miRNA-miRNA crosstalk.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.73}, {"id": "111111", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n\"Accelerating Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection through Parallel Fork Symbolic Execution\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Unfortunately, as reported, existing symbolic tools cost too much time, since they need to execute all paths to detect vulnerabilities. Thus, their accuracy is limited by time. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Park, the first general framework of parallel-fork symbolic execution for smart contracts. The main idea is to use multiple processes during symbolic execution, leveraging multiple CPU cores to enhance efficiency. Firstly, we propose a fork-operation based dynamic forking algorithm to achieve parallel symbolic contract execution. Secondly, to address the SMT performance loss problem in parallelization, we propose an adaptive processes restriction and adjustment algorithm. Thirdly, we design a shared-memory based global variable reconstruction method to collect and rebuild the global variables from different processes.

Over the decades that followed the field expanded, grew, and flourishes to this day. This paper describes the origins and development of the field in the words of many who were deeply involved. Unlike other published work focusing on technical issues, the emphasis here is on historical aspects that are not recorded elsewhere, providing a unique characterization of how the field was created and developed.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111113", "output": "\"Unlocking Creative Potential: Exploring the Intersection of BCIs, Art, and Human-Computer Interaction\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Their interest and creativity is now increasing because of the availability of affordable BCI devices and software that does not require them to invest extensive time in getting the BCI to work or tuning it to their application. Designers of artistic BCIs are often ahead of more traditional BCI researchers in ideas on using BCIs in multimodal and multiparty contexts, where multiple users are involved, and where robustness and efficiency are not the main matters of concern. The aim of this workshop is to look at current (research) activities in BCIs for artistic expression and to identify research areas that are of interest for both BCI and HCI researchers as well as artists/designers of BCI applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "111114", "output": "\"Scalable Error Analysis for Inexact Hardware Design: A Graph-Based Approach to Identifying Error-Prone Circuit Gates\"\n\nor \n\"Efficient Error Tolerance in Approximate Circuits: A Novel Algorithm for Identifying Gate-Level Error Sources\"\n\nor \n\"Graph-Based Error Propagation Analysis for Inexact Hardware", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Several techniques aim to identify circuit portions that can be discarded under an error constraint, but research on systematic methods to determine such error is still at an early stage. We herein illustrate a generic, scalable algorithm that determines the influence of each circuit gate on the final output. The algorithm first partitions the graph representing the circuit, then determines the error propagation model of the resulting subgraphs. When applied to existing approximate design frameworks, our solution improves their efficiency and result quality.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.13}, {"id": "111115", "output": "\"Query Effectiveness Perception and Crowdsourced Estimation of Information Retrieval Performance\"\n\nor \n\n\"User-Centered Evaluation of Query Variations in Information Retrieval: A Crowdsourced Study\"\n\nor \n\n\"Anticipating Query Effectiveness: A Comparative Analysis of Crowdsourced Ratings and Ranked Queries in Information Retrieval", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Recent work with such query variations has demonstrated that different queries can fetch notably divergent sets of documents, even when the queries have identical intents and superficial similarity. That is, different users might receive SERPs of quite different effectiveness for the same information need. That observation then raises an interesting question: do users have a sense of how useful any given query will be? Can they anticipate the effectiveness of alternative queries for the same retrieval need? To explore that question we designed and carried out a crowd-sourced user study in which we asked subjects to consider an information need statement expressed as a backstory, and then provide their opinions as to the relative usefulness of a set of queries ostensibly addressing that objective. We solicited opinions using two different interfaces: one that collected absolute ratings of queries, and one that required that the subjects place a set of queries into \"order\". We found that crowd workers are reasonably consistent in their estimates of how effective queries are likely to be, and also that their estimates correlate positively with actual system performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111116", "output": "\"Interpretable and Scalable Neural Semantic Parsing: A Transition System Approach to Domain-General Representations\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The semantic parser is trained end-to-end using annotated logical forms or their denotations. We achieve the state of the art on SPADES and GRAPHQUESTIONS and obtain competitive results on GEO-QUERY and WEBQUESTIONS. The induced predicate-argument structures shed light on the types of representations useful for semantic parsing and how these are different from linguistically motivated ones.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111117", "output": "Generalizing Volkmann and Topp's Results on p-Partite Uniform Hypergraphs: Conditions for Hypergraph Connectivity", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To this end, we consider a message-passing model that accommodates both synchronous and asynchronous composition of parallel components, in which BTs and other components execute and interact according to the communication patterns commonly adopted in robotic software architectures. We introduce a formal property specification language to encode requirements and build runtime monitors. We performed a set of experiments, both on simulations and on the real robot, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in a realistic application and its integration in a typical robot software architecture. We also provide an OS-level virtualization environment to reproduce the experiments in the simulated scenario.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.98}, {"id": "111119", "output": "\"Coordinating Collaborative Writing: An Exploration of GitHub's Direct and Pull-Based Methods for Task Interdependence and Audience Participation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Since GitHub offers unique features that are different from traditional ways of collaborative writing, it is interesting to investigate how GitHub features are used for writing. In this paper, we present the preliminary findings of a mixed-methods, case study of collaboration practices in a GitHub book project. We found that the use of GitHub depended on task interdependence and audience participation. GitHub's direct push method was used to coordinate both loosely- and tightly-coupled work, with the latter requiring collaborators to follow socially-accepted conventions. The pull-based method was adopted once the project was released to the public. While face-to-face and online meetings were prominent in the early phases, GitHub's issues became instrumental for communication and project management in later phases. Our findings have implications for the design of collaborative writing tools.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "111120", "output": "Concept Drift in Social Groups: Collaborative Dynamics in Recommender Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In the field of recommender systems, this issue is also widely observed, as known as temporal dynamics in user behavior. Furthermore, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic related contingencies, people shift their behavior patterns extremely and tend to imitate others' opinions. The changes in user behavior may not be always rational. Thus, irrational behavior may impair the knowledge learned by the algorithm. It can cause herd effects and aggravate the popularity bias in recommender systems due to the irrational behavior of users. However, related research usually pays attention to the concept drift of individuals and overlooks the synergistic effect among users in the same social group. We conduct a study on user behavior to detect the collaborative concept drifts among users. Also, we empirically study the increase of experience of individuals can weaken herding effects. Our results suggest the CF models are highly impacted by the herd behavior and our findings could provide useful implications for the design of future recommender algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.31}, {"id": "111121", "output": "Novel Student's t-Hidden Markov Model (t-SHMM) with Local Subspace Feature Learning for Enhanced Clustering Performance", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Using both our experimental data and a sophisticated database (DEAP dataset), we investigated the effects of familiarity on brain activity based on EEG signals. Focusing on familiarity studies, we allowed subjects to select the same number of familiar and unfamiliar songs; both resulting datasets demonstrated the importance of reporting self-emotion based on the assumption that the emotional state when experiencing music is subjective. We found evidence that music familiarity influences both the power spectra of brainwaves and the brain functional connectivity to a certain level. We conducted an additional experiment using music familiarity in an attempt to recognize emotional states; our empirical results suggested that the use of only songs with low familiarity levels can enhance the performance of EEG-based emotion classification systems that adopt fractal dimension or power spectral density features and support vector machine, multilayer perceptron or C4.5 classifier. This suggests that unfamiliar songs are most appropriate for the construction of an emotion recognition system.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "111123", "output": "\"Decentralized Virtualization of Community Solar and Energy Storage for Optimal Household Energy Management\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, such a group-owned system does not allow individual control over how the electricity generation from the solar array and energy stored in the battery is used for optimizing a home's electricity bill. To overcome this limitation, we propose vSolar, a technique that virtualizes community solar and battery arrays such that each virtual system can be independently controlled, regardless of others. Further, we present mechanisms and algorithms that allow homes with surplus energy to lend to homes with deficit energy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "111124", "output": "Iterative Curved Surface Fitting for Noise Reduction in Organized Point Cloud Data", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Samples included in a small sliding window positioned in PCD are successively fitted to a quadratic surface from upper left to lower right using a least squares method. In the iterative process, outliers of samples are asymptotically removed based on an evaluation index. This proposed method allows original PCD to be smoothed keeping its own shape feature. Then, the already developed stereolithography (STL) generator is used to produce triangulated patches from the smoothed PCD. The process allows to reconstruct 3D digital data of a real object written with STL format for reverse engineering from original PCD with noise. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed curved surface fitting method are demonstrated through actual smoothing experiments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "111125", "output": "Optimality Analysis in Cooperative Linear-Stochastic Difference Games: A Finite Horizon Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The performance criteria\u2019s convexity can be guaranteed naturally under the weighted matrices\u2019 constraints for the regular cooperative game, and the weighting technique can well characterize the Pareto optimality. We also establish a novel convexity criterion for the cost functionals of the indefinite cooperative game, in which we find that the minimization of the performance criteria\u2019s weighted sum is equivalent to the Pareto optimal strategies. To derive all the Pareto optimal strategies and solutions, we present a computing algorithm using the weighted difference Riccati equation and the weighted difference Lyapunov equation for the regular and the indefinite cases. We present a practical example in the economy to validate the results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "111126", "output": "\"Real-Time Visualization and Predictive Modeling of Wave Power Generation for Enhanced Energy Efficiency\"\n\nor\n\n\"Enhancing Wave Energy Conversion through Real-Time Monitoring and Predictive Analytics\"\n\nor\n\n\"Digital Twin-Based Visualization and Prediction of Wave Power Generation Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"Real-Time Wave Power Generation Monitoring and Forecasting using LSTM Neural", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, as the complexity of the network increases, the traffic congestion problems become major performance bottlenecks. An effective adaptive routing algorithm can help minimize path congestion through load balancing. However, conventional adaptive routing schemes only use current channel-based information to detect the congestion status. This information has difficulty showing the real congestion status under time-variant traffic patterns. To predict temporal network congestion, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based routing was proposed to identify the near-future non-congested path to a desired target according to historical network information. To design a high-efficiency ACO-based routing for traffic balancing in resource-limited NoCs, two major design issues should be considered, including 1) the selection efficiency and 2) the cost efficiency. In this paper, the design challenges and concepts of ACO-based adaptive routings are introduced. Besides, the representative related works are reviewed and summarized. Finally, we conclude the paper and point out the future works of ACO-based routing algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "111130", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.

In a general overview, sensor nodes of WSANs are responsible for data acquisition and sending them to a central node. The central node stores all the received data and performs reactions. Timing verification of WSAN applications to ensure schedulability of tasks is a challenge, and is generally performed by worst-case analysis. This process is error-prone and inherently conservative. On the other hand, using model checking for analyzing WSAN applications results in state space explosion even for middle-sized configurations. The reason is the necessity of considering the interleaving of the large number of sensors in WSANs. In this paper, we show how to build an actor-based model of WSAN applications, starting from sensor node-level and moving towards the full system, and we show how this compositional modeling improves analysability and modifiability. Realtime extension of actor model is appropriate for modeling WSAN applications where we have many concurrent and asynchronous processes, and interdependent realtime deadlines. We demonstrate the approach using a case study of a distributed realtime data acquisition system for high-frequency sensing, where Timed Rebeca is used for modeling. We use model checking to check the intra/inter-sensor node schedulability.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.12}, {"id": "111131", "output": "Comparative Analysis of Parametric Propagators for Pairs of Sum Constraints: A Theoretical and Practical Study", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our method derives digital controllers such that the corresponding closed-loop system, modeled as a sampled-data stochastic control system, satisfies a safety specification with probability above a given threshold. Our technique uses a fast solver and an optimization method to search for candidate controllers, which are then formally evaluated in closed-loop with the system in question by a verified solver. Unstable candidate controllers are discarded by efficiently checking a sufficient condition for Lyapunov stability of sampled-data nonlinear systems. We evaluate our technique on three case studies: an artificial pancreas model, a powertrain control model, and a quadruple-tank process.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111133", "output": "\"Optimizing Wireless LAN Association through Real-time Load-Aware Decision Making\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Operators and service providers remarkably increase the density of wireless access points in order to provide their subscribers with better connectivity and user experience. As a result, WLAN users usually find themselves covered by multiple access points and have to decide which one to associate with. In traditional implementations, most wireless stations would select the access point with the strongest signal, regardless of traffic load on that access point, which might result in heavy congestion and unfair load. In this paper, we propose a novel on-line association algorithm to deal with any sequence of STAs during a long-term time such as one day. the performance of our algorithm is evaluated through simulation and experiments. Simulation results show that our algorithm improves the overall WLAN throughput by up to 37%, compared with the conventional RSSI-based approach. Our algorithm also performs better than SSF (Strongest Signal First) and LAB (Largest Available Bandwidth) in the experiments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111134", "output": "Density Estimation via Score Matching: A Scalable, Inference-Free Framework for High-Dimensional Data", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This problem is especially challenging for complex high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality. A promising solution to this problem is given here in an inference-free hierarchical framework that is built on score matching. We revisit the Bayesian interpretation of the score function and the Parzen score matching, and construct a multilayer perceptron with a scalable objective for learning the energy (i.e. the unnormalized log-density), which is then optimized with stochastic gradient descent. In addition, the resulting deep energy estimator network (DEEN) is designed as products of experts. We present the utility of DEEN in learning the energy, the score function, and in single-step denoising experiments for synthetic and high-dimensional data. We also diagnose stability problems in the direct estimation of the score function that had been observed for denoising autoencoders.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111135", "output": "Automated Estimation of Item Difficulty for Social Studies Tests: A Novel Approach Based on Semantic Features and Machine Learning", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, pretesting is inefficient, and it can lead to item exposure. Hence, an increasing number of studies have invested considerable effort in researching the automated estimation of item difficulty. Language proficiency tests constitute the majority of researched test topics, while comparatively less research has focused on content subjects. This paper introduces a novel method for the automated estimation of item difficulty for social studies tests. In this study, we explore the difficulty of multiple-choice items, which consist of the following item elements: a question and alternative options. We use learning materials to construct a semantic space using word embedding techniques and project an item's texts into the semantic space to obtain corresponding vectors. Semantic features are obtained by calculating the cosine similarity between the vectors of item elements. Subsequently, these semantic features are sent to a classifier for training and testing. Based on the output of the classifier, an estimation model is created and item difficulty is estimated. Our findings suggest that the semantic similarity between a stem and the options has the strongest impact on item difficulty. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed estimation method outperforms pretesting, and therefore, we expect that the proposed approach will complement and partially replace pretesting in future.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111136", "output": "\"Accelerating Convergence and Hyperparameter Robustness in Deep Neural Networks via Second-Order Meta-Learning\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper presents a new CNN learning approach, based on second-order methods, aimed at improving: a) Convergence rates of existing gradient-based methods, and b) Robustness to the choice of learning hyper-parameters (e.g., learning rate). We derive an efficient back-propagation algorithm for simultaneously computing both gradients and second derivatives of the CNN's learning objective. These are then input to a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict optimal updates of CNN parameters in each learning iteration. Both meta-learning of the LSTM and learning of the CNN are conducted jointly. Evaluation on image classification demonstrates that our second-order backpropagation has faster convergences rates than standard gradient-based learning for the same CNN, and that it converges to better optima leading to better performance under a budgeted time for learning. We also show that an LSTM learned to learn a small CNN network can be readily used for learning a larger network.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111137", "output": "Based on the provided abstract and features, I generate the title:\n\n\"Neutrosophic Interval Statistical Method for Variable Sampling Plan Optimization: A Comparative Study with Classical Statistics\"\n\nUsing the similar abstract-title pairs from my past works: <similarpairs>\nUsing the features: <features>\nUsing the abstract-title pairs from other", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The variable control chart, using classical statistics, helps in making acceptance or rejection decisions about the submitted lot of the product. Furthermore, the sampling plan, using classical statistics, assumes the complete or determinate information available about a lot of product. However, in some situations, data may be ambiguous, vague, imprecise, and incomplete or indeterminate. In this case, the use of neutrosophic statistics can be applied to guide the experimenters. In this paper, we originally proposed a new variable sampling plan using the neutrosophic interval statistical method. The neutrosophic operating characteristic (NOC) is derived using the neutrosophic normal distribution. The optimization solution is also presented for the proposed plan under the neutrosophic interval method. The effectiveness of the proposed plan is compared with the plan under classical statistics. The tables are presented for practical use and a real example is given to explain the neutrosophic fuzzy variable sampling plan in the industry.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111138", "output": "Coupled Dynamical Systems: Dimensional Invariance Principles for Networked Systems with Scalar and Matrix Couplings", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Relevant problems on textit{collinear dynamical systems} and their variations are discussed recently by Montenbruck et. al. in cite{collinear2017SCL}, while in this paper we aim to provide a unified analysis to derive the dimensional-invariance principles for networked coupled systems, and to generalize the invariance principles for networked systems with more general forms of coupling terms. To be specific, we consider two types of coupled systems, one with scalar couplings and the other with matrix couplings. Via the textit{rank-preserving flow theory}, we show that any scalar-coupled dynamical system (with constant, time-varying or state-dependent couplings) possesses the dimensional-invariance principles, in that the dimension of the subspace spanned by the individual systemsu0027 solutions remains invariant. For coupled dynamical systems with matrix coefficients/couplings, necessary and sufficient conditions (for constant, time-varying and state-dependent couplings) are given to characterize dimensional-invariance principles. The proofs via a rank-preserving matrix flow theory in this paper simplify the analysis in cite{collinear2017SCL}, and we also extend the invariance principles to the cases of time-varying couplings and state-dependent couplings. Furthermore, subspace-preserving property and signature-preserving flows are also developed for coupled networked systems with particular coupling terms. These invariance principles provide insightful characterizations to analyze transient behaviors and solution evolutions for a large family of coupled systems, such as multi-agent consensus dynamics, distributed coordination systems, formation control systems, among others.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "111139", "output": "Optimization Techniques for Efficient Parallel Algorithm Implementation in High-Performance Computing Architectures.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Nonetheless, because the system is highly complex, operation and networking graph-based environments are time varying, and required information may not be available, it is difficult to leverage traditional optimization techniques to solve the optimal resource allocation problem. In this article, we propose a deep \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-network (DQN)-based scheme to address both bandwidth utilization and energy efficiency in a networking graph-based IIoT system. In detail, we design a DQN model that consists of two deep neural networks (DNNs) and a \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-learning model. The DNN network abstracts the features from the highly dimensional inputs and obtains the approximate \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-function for the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-learning model.

After the training process, the DQN model can select appropriate actions for the agents (i.e., robots in a smart warehouse in this study) to improve bandwidth utilization and energy efficiency. To evaluate our proposed scheme, we design a simulation environment to investigate a typical IIoT scenario: the actuation of robotics in a smart warehouse. We then implement the DQN model and conduct extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our scheme. Our experimental results confirm that our scheme can improve both bandwidth utilization and energy efficiency, as compared to other representative schemes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "111141", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Occlusion-Aware Active Perception for Efficient Robotic Object Existence Prediction\"\n\nUsing the similar abstract-title pairs, I found a pair that matches the topic and style of the abstract: \"Active Perception for Object Existence Prediction in Noisy Environments\"\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Though existing work shows that a robot with active perception can achieve various tasks, it is still unclear if occlusion reasoning can be achieved. To answer this question, we introduce the task of robotic object existence prediction: when being asked about an object, a robot needs to move as few steps as possible around a table with randomly placed objects to predict whether the queried object exists. To address this problem, we propose a novel recurrent neural network model that can be jointly trained with supervised and reinforcement learning methods using a curriculum training strategy. Experimental results show that 1) both active perception and occlusion reasoning are necessary to successfully achieve the task; 2) the proposed model demonstrates a good occlusion reasoning ability by achieving a similar prediction accuracy to an exhaustive exploration baseline while requiring only about 10% of the baseline's number of movement steps on average; and 3) the model generalizes to novel object combinations with a moderate loss of accuracy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111142", "output": "Optimizing Cascade Models for Learning-to-Rank Systems through Joint Stagewise Optimization and Backpropagation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A cascaded ranking architecture turns ranking into a pipeline of multiple stages, and has been shown to be a powerful approach to balancing efficiency and effectiveness trade-offs in large-scale search systems. However, learning a cascade model is often complex, and usually performed stagewise independently across the entire ranking pipeline. In this work we show that learning a cascade ranking model in this manner is often suboptimal in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. We present a new general framework for learning an end-to-end cascade of rankers using backpropagation. We show that stagewise objectives can be chained together and optimized jointly to achieve significantly better trade-offs globally. This novel approach is generalizable to not only differentiable models but also state-of-the-art tree-based algorithms such as LambdaMART and cost-efficient gradient boosted trees, and it opens up new opportunities for exploring additional efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs in large-scale search systems.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111143", "output": "\"Simulating Complex Biological Systems: A Hybrid Approach Combining Discrete Swarm Agents with Continuum Level Set Methods\"\n\nor \n\n\"Enabling Efficient Modeling of Biomedical Flows: A 3D Simulation Framework Integrating Discrete Swarm Agents and Continuum Level Set Methods\"\n\nor \n\n\"Swarm Coordination and Contin", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We present the multiple patterns that compose the EduCOR ontology, highlighting its cross-domain applicability and integrability with other ontologies. A demonstration of the proposed ontology on the real-life learning platform eDoer is discussed as a use case. We evaluate the EduCOR ontology using both gold standard and taskbased approaches. The comparison of EduCOR to three gold schemata, and its application in two use -cases, shows its coverage and adaptability to multiple OER repositories, which allows generating user-centric and labour-market oriented recommendations.

We provide one answer by exploiting an understanding of data and models on mirror neurons to extend a prior neurocomputational model of list learning by macaques, SCP1, which addressed results of the simultaneous chaining paradigm (SCP) to yield a new model, SCP2, that addresses social facilitation (observational learning) effects based on the SCP. SCP2 extends SCP1 by adding action-recognition elements and (vicarious) reward-processing elements to facilitate performance following observation of a demonstrator. Our simulations suggest prior experience is important for the observed facilitation and serves to bridge the (separately collected) neurophysiological and behavioral data.

Assessing nutritional information and nutrient volume from a meal is an important task for diabetes patients. At the moment, diabetes patients learn the assessment of BUs on a scale of one to ten, by learning correspondence of BU and meals from textbooks. We introduce a large scale data set of around 9k different RGB-D images of 60 western dishes acquired using a Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor. We recruited 20 diabetes patients to give expert assessments of BU values to each dish based on several images. For this task, we set a challenging baseline using state-of-the-art CNNs and evaluated it against the performance of human annotators. In our work we present a CNN architecture to infer the depth from RGB-only food images to be used in BU regression such that the pipeline can operate on RGB data only and compare its performance to RGB-D input data. We show that our inferred depth maps from RGB images can replace RGB-D input data at high significance for the BU regression task. In its best configuration, our proposed method achieves a RMSE of 1.53 BUs using RGB and inferred depth. Considering the variability among the raters themselves of RMSE = 0.89, we can show that our baseline method with depth prediction can extract reasonable nutritional information from RGB image data only.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "111151", "output": "\"Learning from Observed Dynamics: Unveiling Effective Policies from Unsupervised Data\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We propose to train a policy by unrolling a learned model of the environment dynamics over multiple time steps while explicitly penalizing two costs: the original cost the policy seeks to optimize, and an uncertainty cost which represents its divergence from the states it is trained on. We measure this second cost by using the uncertainty of the dynamics model about its own predictions, using recent ideas from uncertainty estimation for deep networks. We evaluate our approach using a large-scale observational dataset of driving behavior recorded from traffic cameras, and show that we are able to learn effective driving policies from purely observational data, with no environment interaction.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111152", "output": "\"Hardening Against Power Analysis Attacks: A Study on Decorrelating Current Consumption and Cryptographic Processing in Secure Hardware Implementations\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For simplicity, simplexes and Delta sets are restricted to the Euclidean plane. A planar simplex is either a vertex, a line segment or a filled triangle. In this study of image shapes, a planar Delta set is a sequence of ordered simplicial complexes. The basic approach is to approximate an image shape by decomposing an image region containing the shape into combinations of Delta sets called Delta complexes. This approach to image shapes is motivated by the ease with which shapes covered by Delta complexes can be measured and compared. A number of basic results directly related to shape analysis are also given in the context of Delta complex proximities.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111155", "output": "Video-Based Face Recognition: Benchmarking and Comparative Study of Video-to-Still, Still-to-Video, and Video-to-Video Scenarios", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Real-world video-based face recognition applications require techniques for three distinct scenarios: 1) Video-to-Still (V2S); 2) Still-to-Video (S2V); and 3) Video-to-Video (V2V), respectively, taking video or still image as query or target. To the best of our knowledge, few datasets and evaluation protocols have benchmarked for all the three scenarios. In order to facilitate the study of this specific topic, this paper contributes a benchmarking and comparative study based on a newly collected still/video face database, named COX1 Face DB. Specifically, we make three contributions. First, we collect and release a largescale still/video face database to simulate video surveillance with three different video-based face recognition scenarios (i.e., V2S, S2V, and V2V). Second, for benchmarking the three scenarios designed on our database, we review and experimentally compare a number of existing set-based methods. Third, we further propose a novel Point-to-Set Correlation Learning (PSCL) method, and experimentally show that it can be used as a promising baseline method for V2S/S2V face recognition on COX Face DB. Extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate that video-based face recognition needs more efforts, and our COX Face DB is a good benchmark database for evaluation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111156", "output": "\"Exploring Age Identity in Online Communities: A Multimodal Analysis of Visual and Linguistic Cues in Second Life\"\n\nor\n\n\"Unveiling Age in the Virtual Realm: A Comparative Study of Visual and Textual Indicators in Second Life\"\n\nor\n\n\"Age Identity in the Digital Age: A Mixed-Methods", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Research that does examine online communication by age largely focuses on linguistic elements. However, social identity approaches to group communication emphasize the importance of non-linguistic factors such as appearance and non-verbal behaviors. These factors are especially important to explore in online settings where traditional physical markers of age are largely unseen. To examine ways that users communicate age identity through both visual and textual means, we use multiple linear regression and qualitative methods to explore the behavior of 201 players of a custom game in the virtual world Second Life. Analyses of chat, avatar movement, and appearance suggest that although residents primarily used youthful-looking avatars, age differences emerged more strongly in visual factors than in language use.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111157", "output": "Analyse der Entwicklung der k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz in Deutschland im 20.

Theses biases can be informed by a multitude of non-verbal cues such as voice pitch and voice volume. This project explores how haptic effects, generated from speech, could attenuate listeners' perceived voice-related biases formed from a speaker's voice pitch. Promising preliminary results collected during a decision-making task suggest that the speech to haptic mapping and vibration delivery mechanism employed does attenuate voice-related biases. Accordingly, it is anticipated that such a system could be introduced in the workplace to equalize people's contribution opportunities and to create a more inclusive environment by reversing voice-related biases.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111159", "output": "Hierarchical Confidence Sets for Fine-Grained Categorization: A Semi-Automated Approach to Reducing Error Rates in Realistic Scenarios", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Standard, fully automated systems report a single estimate of the category, or perhaps a ranked list, but have non-neglible error rates for most realistic scenarios, which limits their utility. Instead, we propose a semi-automated system which outputs a it confidence set (CS)--a variable-length list of categories which contains the true one with high probability (e.g., a 99 % CS). Performance is then measured by the expected size of the CS, reflecting the effort required for final identification by the user. The implementation is based on a hierarchical clustering of the full set of categories. This tree of subsets provides a graded family of candidate CS's containing visually similar categories. There is also a learned discriminant score for deciding between each subset and all others combined. Selection of the CS is based on the joint score likelihood under a Bayesian network model. We apply this method to determining the species of a plant from an image of a leaf against either a uniform or natural background. Extensive experiments are reported. We obtain superior results relative to existing methods for point estimates for scanned leaves and report the first useful results for natural images at the expense of asking the user to initialize the process by identifying specific landmarks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "111160", "output": "\"Unsupervised Body Part Regression for Efficient Automatic Body Part Recognition in CT Volumes via Coordinate-Based CNN Loss Functions\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Recent deep learning methods demonstrate promising performance, with the requirement of large amounts of labeled images for training. The intrinsic structural or superior-inferior slice ordering information in CT volumes is not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based unsupervised body part regression (UBR) algorithm to address this problem. A novel unsupervised learning method and two inter-sample CNN loss functions are presented. Distinct from previous work, UBR builds a coordinate system for the human body and outputs a continuous score for each axial slice, representing the normalized position of the body part in the slice. The training process of UBR resembles a self-organization process: slice scores are learned from interslice relationships. The training samples are unlabeled CT volumes that are abundant, thus no extra annotation effort is needed. UBR is simple, fast, and accurate. Quantitative and qualitative experiments validate its effectiveness. In addition, we show two applications of UBR in network initialization and anomaly detection.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "111161", "output": "\"Dendritic Spine Morphology and Function: Unveiling the Diversity of Human Cortical Pyramidal Neurons Through Model-Based Clustering and 3D Reconstruction\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

They have a wide variety of morphologies, and their morphology appears to be critical from the functional point of view. To further characterize dendritic spine geometry, we used in this paper over 7,000 individually 3D reconstructed dendritic spines from human cortical pyramidal neurons to group dendritic spines using model-based clustering. This approach uncovered six separate groups of human dendritic spines. To better understand the differences between these groups, the discriminative characteristics of each group were identified as a set of rules. Model-based clustering was also useful for simulating accurate 3D virtual representations of spines that matched the morphological definitions of each cluster. This mathematical approach could provide a useful tool for theoretical predictions on the functional features of human pyramidal neurons based on the morphology of dendritic spines.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "111162", "output": "\"Simulating Hypoxic Adaptation in Fetal vs. Adult Ventricular Cells: A Comparative Analysis of Glycolytic Metabolism and Energy Homeostasis\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Neurite growth is astonishingly sensitive to shallow concentration gradients, but a widely observed feature of both growth and guidance regulation, with important consequences for development and regeneration, is that both are only elicited over the same relatively narrow range of concentrations. Here we show that all these phenomena can be explained within one theoretical framework. We first test long-standing explanations for the suppression of the trophic effects of nerve growth factor at high concentrations, and find they are contradicted by experiment. Instead we propose a new hypothesis involving inhibitory signalling among the cell bodies, and then extend this hypothesis to show how both growth and guidance can be understood in terms of a common underlying signalling mechanism. This new model for the first time unifies several key features of neurite growth regulation, quantitatively explains many aspects of experimental data, and makes new predictions about unknown details of developmental signalling.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111164", "output": "\"Decoding Digital Evidence: A Semantic Web Approach to Enhancing Forensic Reconstruction\"\n\nor\n\n\"Correlating Digital Footprints: Leveraging Semantic Web Technologies for Improved Forensic Analysis\"\n\nor\n\n\"Semantic Reconstruction of Digital Crimes: A Novel Method for Forensic Investigators\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Forensic investigations include recovery, analysis and presentation of information stored in digital devices and related to computer crimes. These activities often involve the adoption of a wide range of imaging and analysis tools and the application of different techniques on different devices, with the consequence that the reconstruction and presentation activities result complicated. This work presents a method, based on Semantic Web technologies, that helps digital investigators to correlate and present information acquired from forensic data, with the aim to get a more valuable reconstruction of events or actions in order to reach case conclusions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.0}, {"id": "111165", "output": "\"Parallelizing Convolutional Neural Networks via Coupled Ensembles: A Scalable Architecture for Efficient Representation Learning\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Building on existing state of the art models, we propose a reconfiguration of the model parameters into several parallel branches at the global network level, each branch being a standalone CNN. We show that this arrangement is an efficient way to significantly reduce the number of parameters while at the same time improving the performance. The use of branches brings an additional form of regularization. In addition to splitting the parameters into parallel branches, we propose a tighter coupling of these branches by averaging their log-probabilities. The tighter coupling favours the learning of better representations, even at the level of the individual branches, as compared to when each branch is trained independently. We refer to this branched architecture as \u201ccoupled ensembles\u201d. The approach is generic and can be applied to almost any neural network architecture. With coupled ensembles of DenseNet-BC networks and a 25M-parameter budget, we obtain error rates of 2.92%, 15.68% and 1.50% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN respectively. For the same parameter budget, DenseNet-Bchas an error rate of 3.46%, 17.18%, and 1.8% respectively. With ensembles of coupled ensembles of DenseNet-BC networks with a 50M-parameter budget, we obtain error rates of 2.72%, 15.13% and 1.42 % respectively on these tasks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111166", "output": "Integrated Optimization Approach for the Rail-Rail Transshipment Yard Scheduling Problem: A Single MILP Formulation\n\n<similarpairs>\nRail-Rail Transshipment Yard Scheduling Problem: A Single MILP Formulation\nIntegrated Optimization for the Rail-Rail Transshipment Yard Scheduling Problem\nMILP Model for the Rail", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A modern rail---rail train yard consists of huge gantry cranes that move the containers between the trains. In this context, we consider a rail---rail transshipment yard scheduling problem (TYSP) where the containers arrive to the hub and need to be placed on a train that will deliver them to their destination. In the literature, the problem is decomposed hierarchically into five subproblems, which are solved separately. First, the trains have to be grouped into bundles in which they visit the yard. Next, the trains have to be assigned to tracks within these bundles, namely parking positions. Then the final positions for the containers on trains have to be determined. Next, the container moves that need to be performed are assigned to the cranes. Finally, these moves have to be sequenced for each crane for processing. In this paper, an integrated MILP model is proposed, which aims to solve the TYSP as a single optimization problem.

The strength of our proposed formulation is demonstrated via computational experiments using the data from the literature.

Modeling and analyzing uncertain graphs has attracted a great deal of attention. Among the various graph analytic tasks studied, the extraction of dense substructures, such as cores or trusses, has a central role. In this paper, we study the problem of (k, \u03b3)-truss indexing and querying over an uncertain graph . A (k, \u03b3)-truss is the largest subgraph of , such that the probability of each edge being contained in at least k \u2212 2 triangles is no less than \u03b3. Our first proposal, CPT-index, keeps all the (k, \u03b3)-trusses: retrieval for any given k and \u03b3 can be executed in an optimal linear time w.r.t. the graph size of the queried (k, \u03b3)-truss. We develop a bottom-up CPT-indexconstruction scheme and an improved algorithm for fast CPT-indexconstruction using top-down graph partitions. For trading off between (k, \u03b3)-truss offline indexing and online querying, we further develop an approximate indexing approach (\u03f5, \u0394r)-APXequipped with two parameters, \u03f5 and \u0394r, that govern tolerated errors. Extensive experiments using large-scale uncertain graphs with 261 million edges validate the efficiency of our proposed indexing and querying algorithms against state-of-the-art methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111168", "output": "Geometric Disentangled Collaborative Filtering for Hybrid-Geometry Interactions: A Novel Approach to Unveiling Intent Factors in Non-Euclidean User-Item Spaces", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Existing CF approaches usually model interactions solely within the Euclidean space. However, the sophisticated user-item interactions inherently present highly non-Euclidean anatomy with various types of geometric patterns (i.e., tree-likeness and cyclic structures). The Euclidean-based models may be inadequate to fully uncover the intent factors beneath such hybrid-geometry interactions. To remedy this deficiency, in this paper, we study the novel problem of Geometric Disentangled Collaborative Filtering (GDCF), which aims to reveal and disentangle the latent intent factors across multiple geometric spaces. A novel generative GDCF model is proposed to learn geometric disentangled representations by inferring the high-level concepts associated with user intentions and various geometries. Empirically, our proposal is extensively evaluated over five real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of GDCF.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "111169", "output": "Automated Placement of Perspectively Corrected Projection Mapping Content Using Depth Cameras and Perceptual Criteria Optimization", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We analyze the geometry of physical surfaces and the viewing behavior of users over time using depth cameras. Our system measures user view behavior and simulates a virtual projection mapping scene users would see if content were placed in a particular way. OptiSpace evaluates the simulated scene according to perceptual criteria, including visibility and visual quality of virtual content. Finally, based on these evaluations, it optimizes content placement, using a two-phase procedure involving adaptive sampling and the covariance matrix adaptation algorithm. With our proposed architecture, projection mapping applications are developed without any knowledge of the physical layouts of the target environments. Applications can be deployed in different uncontrolled environments, such as living rooms and office spaces.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111170", "output": "Dynamic Rebalancing for Smart Bike-Sharing Systems: A Graph-Based Approach to Predictive Bike Redistribution", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

They provide a low-cost and environment-friendly transportation alternative and help reduce traffic congestion. However, these new services are still under development, and several challenges need to be solved. A major problem is the management of rebalancing trucks in order to ensure that bikes and stalls in the docking stations are always available when needed, despite the fluctuations in the service demand. In this work, we propose a dynamic rebalancing strategy that exploits historical data to predict the network conditions and promptly act in case of necessity. We use Birth-Death Processes to model the stations' occupancy and decide when to redistribute bikes, and graph theory to select the rebalancing path and the stations involved. We validate the proposed framework on the data provided by New York City's bike-sharing system. The numerical simulations show that a dynamic strategy able to adapt to the fluctuating nature of the network outperforms rebalancing schemes based on a static schedule.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111171", "output": "\"Enriching Visual Content through Bimodal Visual-Textual Indexing with Semantic Concepts for Improved Multimedia Coverage and Effectiveness\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This prompted us to investigate the use of both the web as a large information source from where to extract relevant contextual linguistic information and bimodal visual-textual indexing as a technique to enrich the vocabulary of index concepts. Our proposal is based on the signal/semantic approach for multimedia indexing which generates multifacetted conceptual representations of the visual content. We propose to enrich these image representations with concepts automatically extracted from the visual contextual information. We specifically target the integration of semantic concepts, which are more specific than the initial index concepts since they represent the visual content with greater accuracy and precision. Also, we aim to correct the faulty indexes resulting from the automatic semantic tagging. Experimentally, the details of the prototyping are given and the presented technique is tested in a web-scale evaluation on 30 queries representing elaborate image scenes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111172", "output": "\"Efficient Distributed Deep Neural Network Training via Pipeline Parallelism\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Its pipeline parallel computing model avoids the slowdowns faced by data-parallel training when large models and/or limited network bandwidth induce high communication-to-computation ratios. PipeDream reduces communication by up to 95% for large DNNs relative to data-parallel training, and allows perfect overlap of communication and computation. PipeDream keeps all available GPUs productive by systematically partitioning DNN layers among them to balance work and minimize communication, versions model parameters for backward pass correctness, and schedules the forward and backward passes of different inputs in round-robin fashion to optimize time to target accuracy. Experiments with five different DNNs on two different clusters show that PipeDream is up to 5x faster in time-to-accuracy compared to data-parallel training.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.29}, {"id": "111173", "output": "\"Securing the Cyber-Physical Ground: Integrating Secure Software Engineering into Systems Engineering for Autonomous Systems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, current systems engineering processes are not tailored to cyber-physical systems, or lack an integration with security engineering. In this paper, we integrate secure software engineering practices into an engineering process for cyber-physical systems. Thereby, we enable engineers to specify security requirements at the level of systems engineering, and to take effective countermeasures during both platform-independent and platform-specific software engineering. Our key contribution is the integration of threat models for tracing security requirements to countermeasures. We illustrate our approach by an autonomous car with high security requirements.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111174", "output": "Enhancing Developer Satisfaction and Productivity in Software Companies: A Multifaceted Approach to Employee Retention and Customer Satisfaction", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, it is widely acknowledged that the owl:sameAs construct is too blunt a tool for this purpose. It entails full equality between two resources independent of context. But whether or not two resources should be considered equal depends not only on their intrinsic properties, but also on the purpose or task for which the resources are used. We present a system for constructing context-specific equality links. In a first step, our system generates a set of probable links between two given datasets. These potential links are decorated with rich metadata describing how, why, when and by whom they were generated. In a second step, a user then selects the links which are suited for the current task and context, constructing a context-specific \"Lenticular Lens\". Such lenses can be combined using operators such as union, intersection, difference and composition. We illustrate and validate our approach with a realistic application that supports researchers in social science.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111176", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Efficient Distributed Algorithm Design for Large Data\"\n\"Communication-Efficient Clustering in Distributed Data\"\n\"Distributed Partial Optimization for Large-Scale Data\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- Use of \"sublinear\" and \"sub", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In the distributed setting communication typically dominates the query processing time. Thus it becomes crucial to design communication efficient algorithms for queries on distributed data. Simultaneously, it has been widely recognized that partial optimizations, where we are allowed to disregard a small part of the data, provide us significantly better solutions. The motivation for disregarded points often arise from noise and other phenomena that are pervasive in large data scenarios. In this paper we focus on partial clustering problems, k-center, k-median and k-means, in the distributed model, and provide algorithms with communication sublinear of the input size. As a consequence we develop the first algorithms for the partial k-median and means objectives that run in subquadratic running time. We also initiate the study of distributed algorithms for clustering uncertain data, where each data point can possibly fall into multiple locations under certain probability distribution.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111177", "output": "Improving Recognition of Gene Ontology Concepts through Compositional Synonym Generation Rules for Enhanced Biomedical Text Analysis", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this environment, organizations and companies adopt the Linked Data practices utilizing Semantic Web (SW) technologies, in order to publish their data and offer SPARQL endpoints (i.e., SPARQL-based search services). On the other hand, the dominant standard for information exchange in the Web today is XML. The SW and XML worlds and their developed infrastructures are based on different data models, semantics and query languages. Thus, it is crucial to develop interoperability mechanisms that allow the Web of Data users to access XML datasets, using SPARQL, from their own working environments. It is unrealistic to expect that all the existing legacy data (e.g., Relational, XML, etc.) will be transformed into SW data. Therefore, publishing legacy data as Linked Data and providing SPARQL endpoints over them has become a major research challenge. In this direction, we introduce the SPARQL2XQuery Framework which creates an interoperable environment, where SPARQL queries are automatically translated to XQuery queries, in order to access XML data across the Web. The SPARQL2XQuery Framework provides a mapping model for the expression of OWL-RDF/S to XML Schema mappings as well as a method for SPARQL to XQuery translation. To this end, our Framework supports both manual and automatic mapping specification between ontologies and XML Schemas. In the automatic mapping specification scenario, the SPARQL2XQuery exploits the XS2OWL component which transforms XML Schemas into OWL ontologies. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted in order to evaluate the schema transformation, mapping generation, query translation and query evaluation efficiency, using both real and synthetic datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.18}, {"id": "111179", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n\"Power-Aware Multithreading Framework for Reducing Leakage Energy in SMT Environments\"\n\nAlternatively, based on similar abstract-title pairs from my past works:\n\n\"Energy-Efficient Multithreading in SMT: A Probabilistic Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These approaches involve compilers inserting instructions into programs to shut down and wake up components as appropriate based on a compiler data-flow analysis. When applying the power gating control in compilers for multithreading programs, conventional methods can not be applied directly due to that the threads might share the same hardware resources. This paper presents a multithread power-gating framework composed of a multithread power-gating power model and a probabilistic time-slice based multithread power-gating algorithm for reducing the leakage energy when executing multithread programs on simultaneous multithreading (SMT) machines. Our framework estimates the energy usage of multithread as power controls for energy management. Compared to previous work, our method applies power control in multithread programs to the whole program of a concurrent thread region while the previous work only considers the head and tail of a concurrent region. We performed experiments by incorporating our power optimization framework into SUIF compiler tools and by simulating the energy consumption with a SMT simulator based on Wattch toolkits. The experimental results shows about 10% energy reduction in random generated graphs of multithread programs relative to one without power-gating, where leakage contribution was set to 30%. In OpenCL-based BSP kernels, our method reduces total energy by average of 35% that demonstrates our method is efficient on reducing leakage energy of multithread programs in SMT environment.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111180", "output": "\"Conciliating Stakeholder Views: A Semantics-Driven Requirements Language for Enhanced Analysis throughout the System Lifecycle\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In order to reduce inconsistencies, requirements analysis is an important issue of systems engineering. In this context, there is a need for conciliating views of several stakeholders from different domains and for tracing these requirements from specification to realization. The computerization of analysis, with the help of a clearly defined semantics linked to a non-specialist readable language, should lead to overcome this major issue. Several works already go into this direction. The most popular ones are dealing with natural language, easily understandable but with few semantics. Other approaches propose more formal notations, with stronger semantics but then being less affordable by stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a preliminary work that should drive us to define a language dedicated to requirements which combine the best of both worlds in order to ease requirements analysis throughout the system lifecycle.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "111181", "output": "\"Integrating Game-Based Learning with Peer Response: A Joyful Approach to Enhancing Student Motivation and Performance\"\n\nor \n\n\"Game-Based Peer Response: A Novel Framework for Fostering Student Engagement and Academic Achievement\"\n\nor \n\n\"Joyful Peer Response in Game-Based Learning Environments: An Empirical Investigation of", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Accordingly, we propose a joyful peer response (JPR), where game-based learning and peer response are integrated together. Furthermore, two empirical studies were conducted to investigate how high-and low-ability students perform in the JPR and how their perceptions are associated with their performance. Regarding the former, the findings suggest that the JPR is beneficial to high-and low-ability students. Regarding the latter, the findings imply that the writing performance of the high-ability students is majorly related to their perceptions of game elements. On the other hand, the writing performance of the low-ability students is related to their perceptions of both game elements and peer response.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111182", "output": "Adaptive Hardware Implementation of Ink Drop Spread Operator for Real-Time Pattern Classification Tasks in FPGA-Based Active Learning Method", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Active learning method (ALM) is a fuzzy learning algorithm inspired by human brain computations. Unlike traditional algorithms, which employ complicated computations, ALM tries to model human brain computations using qualitative and behavioral descriptions of the problem. The main computational engine in ALM is the ink drop spread (IDS) operator, but this operator imposes high memory requirements and computational costs, making the ALM algorithm and its hardware implementation unsuitable for some of the applications. This paper proposes an adaptive alternative method for implementing the IDS operator; a method which results in a marked reduction in the algorithm\u2019s computational complexity and in the amount of memory required and hardware. To check its validity and performance, the method was used to carry out modeling and pattern classification tasks. This paper used challenging and real-world datasets and compared with well-known algorithms (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and multi-layer perceptron) in software simulation and hardware implementation. Compared to traditional implementations of the ALM algorithm and other learning algorithms, the proposed FPGA implementation offers higher speed, less hardware, and improved performance, thus facilitating real-time application. Our ultimate goal in this paper was to present a hardware implementation with an on-chip training that allows it to adapt to its environment without dependency on the host system (on-chip learning).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "111183", "output": "\"Probabilistic Viewpoint Estimation and 3D Shape Completion from Monocular Video Sequences\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Differently from traditional approaches, this method does not require CAD models or manual supervision. Instead, using only video sequences showing object instances from a moving viewpoint, the method learns a deep neural network that can predict several aspects of the 3D geometry of such objects from single images. The network has three components. The first is a Siamese viewpoint factorization network that robustly aligns the input videos and learns to predict the absolute viewpoint of the object from a single image. The second is a depth estimation network that performs monocular depth prediction. The third is a shape completion network that predicts the full 3D shape of the object from the output of the monocular depth prediction module. While the three modules solve very different task, we show that they all benefit significantly from allowing networks to perform probabilistic predictions.

We focus on a realistic performance metric that considers reference signal (RS) transmission overhead. Finding the optimal subset of RRHs that maximize the network capacity is formulated as an integer programming problem. We develop two efficient algorithms based on greedy search and linear programming relaxation combined with gradient ascent search, respectively. Our simulation results reveal that a larger number of antennas do not always guarantee capacity increase in real communication environments due to RS transmission overhead. The proposed scheme adaptively determines the subset of RRHs considering RS transmission overhead and provides significant capacity gain over previous approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111186", "output": "Handling Missing Values and Variable Type Heterogeneity in Causal Discovery for Medical Research: A Novel Approach for Simulated and Real-World Data", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we consider two challenges in causal discovery that occur very often when working with medical data: a mixture of discrete and continuous variables and a substantial amount of missing values. To the best of our knowledge, there are no methods that can handle both challenges at the same time. In this paper, we develop a new method that can handle these challenges based on the assumption that data are missing at random and that continuous variables obey a non-paranormal distribution. We demonstrate the validity of our approach for causal discovery on simulated data as well as on two real-world data sets from a monetary incentive delay task and a reversal learning task. Our results help in the understanding of the etiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111187", "output": "Control of Linear Systems with Multiple Quantization Channels Using Composite Controllers and Linear Matrix Inequalities for H2 Performance", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We start by mapping the 3D surface onto a 2D domain as in traditional UV mapping to design a set of deformable flat panels called FlexMaps. For these panels, we design and obtain specific mechanical properties such that, once they are assembled, the static equilibrium configuration matches the desired 3D shape. FlexMaps can be fabricated from an almost rigid material, such as wood or plastic, and are made flexible in a controlled way by using computationally designed spiraling microstructures.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "111189", "output": "Channel Diameter and R\u00e9nyi Capacity: Tight Characterizations for Discrete Memoryless Channel Simulation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We present several achievability and infeasibility results, with tight characterizations in special cases. In particular, for the exact model, we fully characterize when a binary symmetric channel can be simulated from a binary erasure channel when there is no shared randomness. We also provide infeasibility and achievability results for the simulation of a binary channel from another binary channel in the case of no shared randomness. To do this, we use the properties of R\u00e9nyi capacity of a given order. We also introduce a notion of \u201cchannel diameter\u201d which is shown to be additive and satisfy a data processing inequality.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111190", "output": "Cross-Lingual Argumentation Mining: Developing Parallel Corpora and Direct Transfer Strategies for Enhanced Monolingual and Bilingual Performance", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this work, we show that the existing resources are, however, not adequate for assessing cross-lingual AM, due to their heterogeneity or lack of complexity. We therefore create suitable parallel corpora by (human and machine) translating a popular AM dataset consisting of persuasive student essays into German, French, Spanish, and Chinese. We then compare (i) annotation projection and (ii) bilingual word embeddings based direct transfer strategies for cross-lingual AM, finding that the former performs considerably better and almost eliminates the loss from cross-lingual transfer. Moreover, we find that annotation projection works equally well when using either costly human or cheap machine translations.

The storage of the containers is one of those operations that require proper management for the efficient utilisation of the yard, requiring rapid retrieval time and a minimum number of re-handlings. The main challenge is when containers of a different size, type, or weight need to be stored in a yard that holds a number of pre-existing containers. This challenge becomes even more complex when the date and time for the departure of the containers are unknown, as is the case when the container is collected by a third-party logistics company without any prior notice being given. The aim of this study is to develop a new system for the management of container yard operations that takes into consideration a number of factors and constraints that occur in a real-life situation. One of these factors is the duration of stay for the topmost containers of each stack, when the containers are stored. Because the duration of stay for containers in a yard varies dynamically over time, an \u2018ON/OFF\u2019 strategy is proposed to activate/deactivate the duration of stay factor constraint if the length of stay for these containers varies significantly over time. A number of tools and techniques are utilised for developing the proposed system including: discrete event simulation for the modelling of container storage and retrieval operations, a fuzzy knowledge-based model for the stack allocation of containers, and a heuristic algorithm called \u2018neighbourhood\u2019 for the container retrieval operation. Results show that by adopting the proposed \u2018ON/OFF\u2019 strategy, 5% of the number of re-handlings, 2.5% of the total retrieval time, 6.6% of the total re-handling time and 42% of the average waiting time per truck are reduced.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "111192", "output": "Uncertainty and Argumentation: A Probabilistic Framework for Quantifying and Qualifying Qualitative Uncertainty", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Due to a variety of interests, probabilistic argumentation is approached in the literature with different frameworks, pertaining to structured and abstract argumentation, and with respect to diverse types of uncertainty, in particular the uncertainty on the credibility of the premises, the uncertainty about which arguments to consider, and the uncertainty on the acceptance status of arguments or statements. Towards a general framework for probabilistic argumentation, we investigate a labelling-oriented framework encompassing a basic setting for rule-based argumentation and its (semi-) abstract account, along with diverse types of uncertainty. Our framework provides a systematic treatment of various kinds of uncertainty and of their relationships and allows us to back or question assertions from the literature.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111193", "output": "Interactive Spreadsheet Algorithmic Debugging: Fragmenting Spreadsheets for Enhanced Efficiency and User Experience", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To minimize such risks, various automated testing and debugging approaches for spreadsheets were proposed. In such approaches, often one main assumption is that the spreadsheet developer is able to indicate if the outcomes of certain calculations correspond to the intended values. This, however, might require that the user performs calculations manually, a process which can easily become tedious and error-prone for more complex spreadsheets. In this work, we propose an interactive spreadsheet algorithmic debugging method, which is based on partitioning the spreadsheet into fragments. Test cases can then be automatically or manually created for each of these smaller fragments, whose correctness or faultiness can be easier assessed by users than test cases that cover the entire spreadsheet. The annotated test cases are then fed into an algorithmic debugging technique, which returns a set of formulas that could have caused any observed failures, i.e., discrepancies between the expected and computed calculation outcomes. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the suggested decomposition approach can speed up the algorithmic debugging process and significantly reduce the number of fault candidates returned by the algorithm. An additional laboratory study shows that fragmenting a spreadsheet with our method furthermore reduces the time needed by users for creating test cases for a spreadsheet.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "111194", "output": "\"Integrating Control-Theoretic and Programmable Networking Approaches for Enhanced Cyber-Physical System Security\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The use of powerful, intelligent systems is one of the relevant solutions in the digitalisation that is now spreading in industry and business. Digitalisation brings increasing competition, slimmer margins for productivity and profitability and more pronounced requirements for effective planning, problem solving and decision making. This requires a transfer of knowledge from experts and experienced people to novice system operators\u2014and to automated, intelligent systems\u2014a transfer we call knowledge mobilisation. We will work out reasons for why digital coaching will be a key part of knowledge mobilisation and a key step in the development of instruments we need for the progress of digitalisation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111196", "output": "Lower Bounds for Learning Algorithms: A Matrix-Based Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

But in spite of the apparent availability of relational content, the semantics and granularity of these sources don't always match the requirements of specific tasks. Yet even when the coverage of explicit relational knowledge in a source seems inadequate, there may be implicit knowledge in the complete space of relation instances.\n\nIn this paper, we show that explicit relation instances in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) are insufficient for our task of detecting relations between concepts in Electronic Medical Records. But by mining UMLS for relational paths between pairs of concepts in a training set, then using generalizations of those paths as features in a classifier, we achieve better results on the relation detection task than using state-of-the-art, corpus-based relation extractors. We further show that by combining the mined path-based features with the features used in the corpus-based extractors, we achieve even better performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111198", "output": "Based on the provided features, I'll generate a title.

JR provides dynamic remote virtual machine creation, dynamic remote object creation, remote method invocation, dynamic process creation, rendezvous, asynchronous message passing, semaphores, concurrent invocation, and shared variables. This paper presents RJ, a package for Java that provides JR-like features. The paper gives an overview of RJ and its key features; describes the implications of RJ's design, including how RJ provides additional, useful flexibility; discusses the implementation of RJ; and gives qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our work with respect to feasibility and usability, experimentation, migration, and performance. RJ has been successful in meeting these goals and in providing insight into the trade-offs between using a concurrent programming language versus using the equivalent concurrent package. Our work has yielded a few surprises in dealing with some concurrent programming language features, in understanding the run-time performances of JR versus RJ programs, and in obtaining some additional, useful flexibility for concurrent programming applications.

However, deploying UAVs in tight, indoor spaces, especially close to humans, remains a challenge. One solution, when limited payload is required, is to use micro-UAVs, which pose less risk to humans and typically cost less to replace after a crash. However, micro-UAVs can only carry a limited sensor suite, e.g. a monocular camera instead of a stereo pair or LiDAR, complicating tasks like dense mapping and markerless multi-person 3D human pose estimation, which are needed to operate in tight environments around people. Monocular approaches to such tasks exist, and dense monocular mapping approaches have been successfully deployed for UAV applications. However, despite many recent works on both marker-based and markerless multi-UAV single-person motion capture, markerless single-camera multi-person 3D human pose estimation remains a much earlier-stage technology, and we are not aware of existing attempts to deploy it in an aerial context. In this paper, we present what is thus, to our knowledge, the first system to perform simultaneous mapping and multi-person 3D human pose estimation from a monocular camera mounted on a single UAV.

For this, we propose adequate mechanisms to represent the various components of Mizar. We express Mizar types in a uniform way, provide a common type intersection operation, allow reasoning about type inhabitation, and develop a type inference mechanism. We provide Mizar-like definition mechanisms which require the same proof obligations and provide same derived properties. Structures and set comprehension operators can be defined as definitional extensions. Re-formalized proofs from various parts of the Mizar Library show the practical usability of the specified foundations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.3}, {"id": "111202", "output": "\"Generic yet Discriminative: Exploring Multiple Metrics and Methods for Enhanced User Understanding in Content-Based Recommendation Systems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We assume having explicit ratings with time-stamps from each user. We integrate three different movie data sets, trying to avoid features specific for single data and try to be more generic. We use several metrics which were not used so far in the recommender systems domain. Besides classical rating approximation with RMSE and ratio of order agreement we study new metrics for predicting Next-k and at least 1-hit at Next-k. Using these Next-k and 1-hit we try to model display of our recommendation --- we can display k objects and hope to achieve at least one hit. We trace performance of our methods and metrics also as a distribution along each single user. We define transparent and complicated users with respect to number of methods which achieved at least one hit. We provide results of experiments with several combinations of methods, data sets and metrics along these three axes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111203", "output": "\"Advanced Machine Learning for Attributional Rule Induction in Meta-Analysis: A Novel Approach to Enhancing Predictive Accuracy and Interpretability in Metabolic Syndrome Diagnosis\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

By combining results of multiple studies, meta-analysis is able to increase confidence in its conclusions, validate particular study results, and sometimes lead to new findings. Extensive theory has been built on how to aggregate results from multiple studies and arrive to the statistically valid conclusions. Surprisingly, very little has been done to adopt advanced machine learning methods to support meta-analysis.In this paper we describe a novel machine learning methodology that is capable of inducing accurate and easy to understand attributional rules from aggregated data. Thus, the methodology can be used to support traditional meta-analysis in systematic reviews. Most machine learning applications give primary attention to predictive accuracy of the learned knowledge, and lesser attention to its understandability. Here we employed attributional rules, the special form of rules that are relatively easy to interpret for medical experts who are not necessarily trained in statistics and meta-analysis.The methodology has been implemented and initially tested on a set of publicly available clinical data describing patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). The objective of this application was to determine rules describing combinations of clinical parameters used for metabolic syndrome diagnosis, and to develop rules for predicting whether particular patients are likely to develop secondary complications of MS. The aggregated clinical data was retrieved from 20 separate hospital cohorts that included 12 groups of patients with present liver disease symptoms and 8 control groups of healthy subjects. The total of 152 attributes were used, most of which were measured, however, in different studies. Twenty most common attributes were selected for the rule learning process. By applying the developed rule learning methodology we arrived at several different possible rulesets that can be used to predict three considered complications of MS, namely nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), simple steatosis (SS), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "111204", "output": "\"Mitigating the Tension Between Expediency and Sustainability in Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Development: A Responsible AI Perspective\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

They form a bilateral competition market, where crowdsourcers compete for the limited sensing service and smartphone contributors compete for the limited budget from crowdsourcers. Each crowdsourcer has to select an \u201coptimal\u201d budget that can attract enough smartphone contributions. Each smartphone contributor has to decide the crowdsourcers to join, while a congested crowdsourcer may result in a low reward. To achieve the respective goals of crowdsourcers and smartphone contributors, the underlying rational and characteristics in this bilateral competition market needs to be better understood. In this paper, we present a game theoretic study of such a bilateral competition market. To be more practical, we consider the bounded rationality of smartphone contributors. We formulate the dynamic behavior of smartphone contributors as an evolutionary game and present an algorithm for the implementation of evolution process. To model the competition among crowdsourcers, we use a non-cooperative game. We prove the existence of Nash equilibrium and propose an iterative algorithm to achieve the Nash equilibrium.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111206", "output": "Temporal Query Language Extension for Relational Databases Using Interval Adjustment, Timestamp Propagation, and Attribute Scaling", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While SQL-based database management systems (DBMSs) are capable of supporting the management of interval data, the support they offer can be improved considerably. A range of proposed temporal data models and query languages offer ample evidence to this effect. Natural queries that are very difficult to formulate in SQL are easy to formulate in these temporal query languages. The increased focus on analytics over historical data where queries are generally more complex exacerbates the difficulties and thus the potential benefits of a temporal query language. Commercial DBMSs have recently started to offer limited temporal functionality in a step-by-step manner, focusing on the representation of intervals and neglecting the implementation of the query evaluation engine. This article demonstrates how it is possible to extend the relational database engine to achieve a full-fledged, industrial-strength implementation of sequenced temporal queries, which intuitively are queries that are evaluated at each time point. Our approach reduces temporal queries to nontemporal queries over data with adjusted intervals, and it leaves the processing of nontemporal queries unaffected. Specifically, the approach hinges on three concepts: interval adjustment, timestamp propagation, and attribute scaling. Interval adjustment is enabled by introducing two new relational operators, a temporal normalizer and a temporal aligner, and the latter two concepts are enabled by the replication of timestamp attributes and the use of so-called scaling functions. By providing a set of reduction rules, we can transform any temporal query, expressed in terms of temporal relational operators, to a query expressed in terms of relational operators and the two new operators. We prove that the size of a transformed query is linear in the number of temporal operators in the original query. An integration of the new operators and the transformation rules, along with query optimization rules, into the kernel of PostgreSQL is reported. Empirical studies with the resulting temporal DBMS are covered that offer insights into pertinent design properties of the article's proposal. The new system is available as open-source software.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111207", "output": "Location Injection Attacks: A Novel Threat to Anonymization and the Proposal of k-Trustee for Resilience", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A fundamental limitation of such mechanisms is that users and their location information in the system are inherently trusted by the Anonymization Server without any verification. In this paper, we show that such an issue could lead to a new class of attacks called location injection attacks which can successfully violate users\u2019 in-distinguishability among a set of users. We propose and characterize location injection attacks by presenting a set of attack models and quantifying the costs associated with them. We present and evaluate k-Trustee, a trust-aware location cloaking mechanism that is resilient to location injection attacks and guarantees a lower bound on the user\u2019s in-distinguishability. k-Trustee guarantees that each user in a given cloaked region can achieve the required k-Anonymity by including at least k-1 other trusted users in the cloaked region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of k-Trustee through extensive experiments in a real-world geographic map and our experimental results show that the proposed cloaking algorithm guaranteeing k-Trustee is effective against various location injection attacks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111208", "output": "\"RF-Wear: A Wearable, Low-Cost, and Washable Solution for Passive RFID-Based Skeleton Tracking\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In particular, the spread of social network services is allowing researchers in science and technology to share and develop their latest technologies at a fast rate. In the era of Big Data, there are increasing needs for a system that can infer analytical information about the research activities of such researchers, but no system that satisfies the requirements exists at the moment. Therefore, this study proposes a sematic complex event processing model for reasoning. The study then details an architecture in which such analytics is processed on a real-time basis in a distributed environment. With this architecture, researchers can easily monitor their individual research activities in an up to date manner and use such analytical data as a basis to set their future research directions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111210", "output": "Comparative Analysis of Cores and Dominance Cores in Fuzzy Cooperative Games", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The degree of bowel cleansing directly affects the possibility to detect diseases and may influence decisions on screening and follow-up examination intervals. An accurate assessment of bowel preparation quality is therefore important. Despite the use of reliable and validated bowel preparation scales, the grading may vary from one doctor to another. An objective and automated assessment of bowel cleansing would contribute to reduce such inequalities and optimize use of medical resources. This would also be a valuable feature for automatic endoscopy reporting in the future. In this paper, we present Nerthus, a dataset containing videos from inside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, showing different degrees of bowel cleansing. By providing this dataset, we invite multimedia researchers to contribute in the medical field by making systems automatically evaluate the quality of bowel cleansing for colonoscopy. Such innovations would probably contribute to improve the medical field of GI endoscopy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "111212", "output": "\"Establishing a Benchmark for Multiple Object Tracking: A Comprehensive Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Methods\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A special type of ultrasound technique, transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound can be used to measure blood flows in cerebral blood vessels through acoustic bone windows of the intact human skull. Although TCD ultrasound is commonly used to diagnose and monitor a range of neurovascular conditions, such as stroke, interpretation of the image content in the TCD scans and quick localization of the targeted blood vessels with it can be difficult due to inherent challenges of its unique image contrasts, relatively low image quality, and 2D nature of the technique in relation to the 3D brain anatomy that is invisible to the clinician. These drawbacks may hinder the efficiency and even accuracy of the TCS examinations, especially for novel users. To render the procedure more efficient and intuitive, we developed a prototype of augmented-reality system to guide the procedure by fusing a population-averaged probabilistic blood vessel atlas with camera footages of the patient. The system prototype was demonstrated with healthy subjects, and is expected to facility the clinical TCD examination, as well as to help in the educational context for new clinicians and clinical technicians.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "111214", "output": "Cooperative Network Design for Buffer-Aided Multi-Antenna Source and Relays: Mitigating Inter-Relay Interference Through Joint Precoding and Relay-Pair Selection", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Such a setup could represent a cellular downlink scenario, in which the source can be a more powerful wireless device with a buffer and multiple antennas, while a set of intermediate less powerful devices are used as relays to reach the destination. The main target is to recover the multiplexing loss of the network by having the source and a relay to simultaneously transmit their information to another relay and the destination, respectively. Successive transmissions in such a cooperative network, however, cause inter-relay interference (IRI). First, by assuming global channel state information (CSI), we show that the detrimental effect of IRI can be alleviated by precoding at the source, mitigating or even fully cancelling the interference. A cooperative relaying policy is proposed that employs a joint precoding design and relay-pair selection. Note that both fixed rate and adaptive rate transmissions can be considered. For the case when channel state information is only available at the receiver side (CSIR), we propose a relay selection policy that employs a phase alignment technique to reduce the IRI. The performance of the two proposed relay pair selection policies are evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art relaying schemes in terms of outage and throughput. The results show that the use of a powerful source can provide considerable performance improvements.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.69}, {"id": "111215", "output": "\"Assessing the Efficacy of Native Code Debugging Information in Source-Level Debugging\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this regard, many well-known algorithms are designed building on the assumption of signal subspace separation among user equipments (UEs), which is hardly satisfied in practice. To cope with this issue, our prior work introduced the concept of covariance shaping to enforce statistical orthogonality by exploiting the multiple antennas at the UE-side in the simple case of two UEs. This paper focuses on: i) extending the covariance shaping approach to a more general multi-user setting, and ii) evaluating its performance in several realistic scenarios, providing useful insights into its behavior and practical implementation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.69}, {"id": "111217", "output": "\"Automated Maintenance of Canned Patterns for Efficient Visual Graph Query Interfaces\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Efficient Maintenance of Canned Patterns for GUIs\"\n\"Automated Generation of Canned Patterns for Visual Subgraph Querying\"\n\"Adaptive GUI for Efficient Subgraph Query Formulation\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Unfortunately, manual generation of canned patterns is not only labour intensive but also may lack diversity to support efficient visual formulation of a wide range of subgraph queries. Recent efforts have taken a data-driven approach to select high-quality canned patterns for a gui automatically from the underlying graph database. However, as the underlying database evolves, these selected patterns may become stale and adversely impact efficient query formulation. In this paper, we present a novel framework called Midas for efficient and effective maintenance of the canned patterns as the database evolves. Specifically, it adopts a selective maintenance strategy that guarantees progressive gain of coverage of the patterns without sacrificing their diversity and cognitive load.

The validation checks if concurrent mutations interfered with the traversal to determine if the operation should proceed or restart. A fundamental challenge is to discover a necessary and sufficient validation check that has to be performed to guarantee correctness.\n\nIn this paper, we show a necessary and sufficient condition for validating traversals in search trees. The condition relies on a new concept of succinct path snapshots, which are derived from and embedded in the structure of the tree. We leverage the condition to design a general lock-free membership test suitable for any search tree. We then show how to integrate the validation condition in update operations of (non-rebalancing) binary search trees, internal and external, and AVL trees. We experimentally show that our new algorithms outperform existing ones.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111219", "output": "\"Adaptive Labeling for Large-Scale Annotated Corpora: A Bayesian Approach to Enhancing Annotator Efficiency and Accuracy\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Adaptive Labeling for Large-Scale Annotated Corpora\", \"Bayesian Methods for Annotator Training and Evaluation\"],\n[\"Improving Annotator Efficiency", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, such datasets depend on an enormous amount of human labeling effort. When the labels correspond to well-known concepts, it is straightforward to train the annotators by giving a few examples with known answers. It is also straightforward to judge the quality of their labels. Neither is true when there are thousands of complex domain-specific labels. Training on all labels is infeasible and the quality of an annotator's judgements may be vastly different for some subsets of labels than for others. This paper proposes a set of data-driven algorithms to 1) train image annotators on how to disambiguate among automatically generated candidate labels, 2) evaluate the quality of annotators\u2019 label suggestions, and 3) weigh predictions. The algorithms adapt to the skills of each annotator both in the questions asked and the weights given to their answers. The underlying judgements are Bayesian, based on adaptive priors. We measure the benefits of these algorithms on a live user experiment related to image-based plant identification involving around 1000 people. The proposed methods are shown to enable huge gains in annotation accuracy. A standard user can correctly label around $2\\\\%$ of our data. This goes up to $80\\\\%$ with machine learning assisted training and assignment and up to almost $90\\\\%$ when doing a weighted combination of several annotators\u2019 labels.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111220", "output": "\"Decoupling A/B Testing from Application Code: A Solution Based on Archface-U and Aspect Oriented Programming\"\n\nor\n\n\"Minimizing Code Complexity in A/B Testing: An Approach Utilizing Archface-U and AOP\"\n\nor\n\n\"Separating A/B Testing Logic from Application Code: A Proposal Lever", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In A/B testing, a developer has to implement multiple variations of application, assign each variation to a subset of the entire user population randomly, and analyze log data to decide which variation should be used as a final product. Therefore, it is challenging to keep the application code clean in A/B testing, because defining variations of software or assigning user to each variation needs the modification of code. In fact there are some existing tools to approach this problem. Considering such a context of A/B testing research, we propose the solution based on the interface Archface-U and AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) which aims to minimize the complication of code in A/B testing.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111221", "output": "Frame Freezing Quality of Experience Assessment Model for Mobile Video: A Novel No-Reference Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Four source video sequences with smooth motion intensity which were extracted from LIVE mobile database have been used to create different types of test sequences. Two subjective experiments are conducted with these distorted sequences, and the Differential Mean Opinion Scores (DMOS) are obtained. Then a QoE model is proposed based on the experimental results. This model can quantitatively measure the perceptual quality of users' experience when they are watching the frame freezing videos. Due to the lack of publicly available datasets, we establish a new database of mobile videos with frame freezing distortion based on the LIVE mobile database. The proposed model is compared with three other QoE assessment metrics on the new database, and the result shows the proposed model has a better performance than others.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111222", "output": "Feature-based articulatory phonology for sub-phonetic feature development and evaluation: A review", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Due to heterogeneous mobile devices, networks, and user preferences, the demands of transcoding source videos into different versions have increased significantly. However, video transcoding is a time-consuming task, and how to guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) for large video data is very challenging, particularly for those real-time applications that hold strict delay requirement such as live TV. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based online video transcoding (COVT) system aiming to offer economical and QoS guaranteed solution for online large-volume video transcoding. COVT utilizes the performance profiling technique to obtain the different performances of transcoding tasks in different infrastructures. Based on the profiles, we model the cloud-based transcoding system as a queue and derive the QoS values of the system based on the queuing theory. With the analytically derived relationship between QoS values and the number of CPU cores required for transcoding workloads, COVT is able to solve the optimization problem and obtain the minimum resource reservation for specific QoS constraints. A task scheduling algorithm is further developed to dynamically adjust the resource reservation and schedule the tasks so as to guarantee the QoS in runtime. We implement a prototype system of COVT and experimentally study the performance on real-world workloads. Experimental results show that the COVT effectively provisions a minimum number of resources for predefined QoS. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method under large-scale video data, we further perform simulation evaluation, which again shows that the COVT is capable of achieving economical and QoS-aware video transcoding in cloud environment.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.19}, {"id": "111224", "output": "Sparse Unmixing with Least Angle Regression-Based Constrained Sparse Unmixing (LARCSU): A Novel Approach for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery Analysis", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This approach involves reformulating the traditional linear spectral unmixing problem by finding the optimal subset of signatures in this spectral library using the sparse regression technique, and has greatly improved the estimation of fractional abundances in ubiquitous mixed pixels. Since the potentially large standard spectral library can be given a priori, the most challenging task is to compute the regression coefficients, i.e., the fractional abundances, for the linear regression problem. There are many mathematical techniques that can be used to deal with the spectral unmixing problem; e.g., ordinary least squares (OLS), constrained least squares (CLS), orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and basis pursuit (BP). However, due to poor prediction accuracy and non-interpretability, the traditional methods often cannot obtain satisfactory estimations or achieve a reasonable interpretation. In this paper, to improve the regression accuracy of sparse unmixing, least angle regression-based constrained sparse unmixing (LARCSU) is introduced to further enhance the precision of sparse unmixing. Differing from the classical greedy algorithms and some of the cautious sparse regression-based approaches, the LARCSU algorithm has two main advantages. Firstly, it introduces an equiangular vector to seek the optimal regression steps based on the simple underlying geometry. Secondly, unlike the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithms that introduce one or more multipliers or augmented terms during their optimization procedures, no parameters are required in the computational process of the LARCSU approach. The experimental results obtained with both simulated datasets and real hyperspectral images confirm the effectiveness of LARCSU compared with the current state-of-the-art spectral unmixing algorithms. LARCSU can obtain a better fractional abundance map, as well as a higher unmixing accuracy, with the same order of magnitude of computational effort as the CLS-based methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "111225", "output": "Dynamic Task Allocation and Service Migration in Edge-Cloud IoT Systems: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, due to the limited capacity of edge servers (ESs) and the dynamic computing requirements, the system needs to dynamically update the task allocation policy according to real-time system states. Service migration is essential to ensure service continuity when implementing dynamic task allocation. Therefore, this article investigates the long-term dynamic task allocation and service migration (DTASM) problem in edge-cloud IoT systems where users\u2019 computing requirements and mobility change over time. The DTASM problem is formulated to achieve the long-term performance of minimizing the load forwarded to the cloud while fulfilling the seamless migration constraint and the latency constraint at each time of implementing the DTASM decision. First, the DTASM problem is divided into two subproblems: 1) the user selection problem on each ES and 2) the system task allocation problem. Then, the DTASM problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and an approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. To tackle the challenge of vast discrete action spaces for DTASM task allocation in the system with a mass of IoT users, a training architecture based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is employed. Meanwhile, each action is divided into a differentiable action for policy training and one mapped action for implementation in the IoT system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based approach obtains the long-term optimal system performance compared to other benchmarks while satisfying seamless service migration.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111226", "output": "\"Efficient FPGA Emulation of Mixed-Signal Systems via Superposition-Based Digital-Analog Interfacing\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We represent the analog output of a block as a superposition of step responses to changes in its analog input, and the output is evaluated only when needed by the digital subsystem. Our architecture is therefore intended for digitally-driven systems; that is, those in which the inputs of analog dynamical blocks change only on digital clock edges. We implemented a high-speed link transceiver design using the proposed architecture on a Xilinx FPGA. This design demonstrates how our approach breaks the link between simulation rate and time resolution that is characteristic of prior approaches. The emulator is flexible, allowing for the real-time adjustment of analog dynamics, clock jitter, and various design parameters. We demonstrate that our architecture achieves 1% accuracy while running 3 orders of magnitude faster than a comparable high-performance CPU simulation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111227", "output": "\"Automated Feature Selection for Competitor Relationship Analysis: A Comparative Study of Expert-Curated and Automated Approaches\"\n\nor\n\n\"Feature Selection for Competitor Webpage Analysis: Evaluating Expert-Curated and Automated Methods for Enhanced Predictive Performance\"\n\nor\n\n\"Overcoming Domain-Specific Challenges in Competitor Relationship", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

One important resource for analyzing competitor relationships are business webpages, which can capture the mission, products, services, and key markets associated with a company. However, webpages also contain irrelevant, extraneous, or misleading text, hampering prediction. To address this challenge, predictive models use a process known as feature selection to identify only relevant terms. The diversity and specificity of business domains pose a challenge for automated approaches for feature selection. In this paper, we compare two approaches to feature selection: manually-curated lists of terms provided by experts and automated approaches to feature selection. We evaluate several approaches to feature selection and their impact on predicting competitor relationships, demonstrating that carefully designed automated feature selection approaches can surpass the performance of manually-curated word lists by 10%.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111228", "output": "Reusing Model Transformations in Model-Driven Engineering: A Comparative Analysis of Approaches and Their Reuse Mechanisms", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Radiomics is a recent medical imaging field that has shown during the past few years to be promising for achieving this personalization. However, a recent study shows that most of the state-of-the-art works in Radiomics fail to identify this problem as a multi-view learning task and that multi-view learning techniques are generally more efficient. In this work, we propose to further investigate the potential of one family of multi-view learning methods based on Multiple Classifier Systems where one classifier is learnt on each view and all classifiers are combined afterwards. In particular, we propose a random forest based dynamic weighted voting scheme, which personalizes the combination of views for each new patient to classify. The proposed method is validated on several real-world Radiomics problems.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111231", "output": "Based on the provided features, I'll generate a title.

The idea is to explore simultaneously, by relaxing some firing order constraints of persistent transitions (An enabled transition is persistent, if it cannot be disabled until its firing.), several equivalent sequences, while computing the convex hull of the abstract states reached by these equivalent sequences. However, unlike timed automata, in the TPN state space abstractions, the union of the abstract states reached by different interleavings of the same set of non conflicting transitions is not necessarily identical to their convex hull. Moreover, the convex hull over-approximation preserves neither the boundedness nor the reachability properties of the TPN. In this context, the main challenge is to establish sufficient conditions over transitions that ensure, in addition to their persistency, identity between the union and the convex hull of the abstract states reachable by their different interleavings. This paper shows how to weaken the sufficient conditions proposed in the literature, by taking into better account the structure, the marking, the static and the dynamic time parameters of the TPN.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111232", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will attempt to generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Smart Grids and Wireless Communication Protocols\", \"Wireless Metering Systems for Energy Efficiency\", \"Urban Propagation and Network Design for Smart Grids\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n[\"Use of technical", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Unfortunately, the lack of established and shared international standards represents a serious hindrance to be overcome for a complete development of a profitable market. The identification of suitable communication protocols and cost-effective network architectures represent a challenging aspect. In this framework, different network design solutions for wireless smart metering systems at 169 MHz are considered and investigated in this paper, aiming at cost efficient deployment based on extensive re-use of existing infrastructures in urban scenarios, namely, macro-cellular and lighting networks. Coverage assessment and frequency planning issues are addressed, together with an ad hoc measurement campaign carried out to fill the gap in the knowledge of urban propagation in the 169 MHz band. Results show that cost-effective deployment of the intelligent metering network is achievable. Notably, a spatial reuse factor larger than the overall number of available frequency channels might be necessary, thus meaning that the spectral resources shall be also allocated according to a time division scheme, where the hubs are switched off at turn. Anyway, this requirement should not affect the overall reading rate in practical applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111233", "output": "\"Algebraic Foundations of Sequential and Concurrent Programming: Unifying Laws and Calculi\"\n\nor \n\n\"Sequential and Concurrent Programming Laws: A Unified Algebraic Framework\"\n\nor \n\n\"From Algebra to Calculus: Deriving Laws for Sequential and Concurrent Programming\"\n\nor \n\n\"Unified Principles of Sequential and Concurrent Programming: A Study", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Because radars in the current form of a WRNS operate in distinct frequency bands, operating a WRNS consisting of a large number of radars is very costly in terms of frequency resource. In this paper, we propose a novel WRNS in which multi-site weather radars share the same frequency band. By employing pulse compression with nearly orthogonal polyphase codes and sidelobe removal processing, a weather radar of the proposed frequency-sharing WRNS addresses inter-site and intra-site interferences simultaneously. Through computer simulations, we show the feasibility of the proposed system taking the performance requirement of a typical single weather radar into account.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111238", "output": "\"Computational and Verifiable Solutions to Reachability Problems in Rewrite Theories with Membership Equational Logic\"\n\nor \n\"Reachability in Rewrite Theories: A Computational and Verifiable Framework\"\n\nor \n\"Rewrite Theories with Membership Equational Logic: A New Approach to Verifiable and Computable Reachability\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Applications that have to deal with big multimedia collections need to manage the volume of data and to effectively and efficiently search within these data. When providing similarity search, a multimedia retrieval system has to consider the actual multimedia content, the corresponding structured metadata (e.g., content author, creation date, etc.) and\u2014for providing similarity queries\u2014the extracted low-level features stored as densely populated high-dimensional feature vectors. In this paper, we present ADAM pro , a combined database and information retrieval system that is particularly tailored to big multimedia collections. ADAM pro follows a modular architecture for storing structured metadata, as well as the extracted feature vectors and it provides various index structures, i.e., Locality-Sensitive Hashing, Spectral Hashing, and the VA-File, for a fast retrieval in the context of a similarity search. Since similarity queries are often long-running, ADAM pro supports progressive queries that provide the user with streaming result lists by returning (possibly imprecise) results as soon as they become available. We provide the results of an evaluation of ADAM pro on the basis of several collection sizes up to 50 million entries and feature vectors with different numbers of dimensions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "111240", "output": "\"Adaptive Change Detection under Transient Dynamics: A Comparative Study of Dynamic Cumulative Sum Algorithms\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The observations within the different phases are generated by different distributions. The objective is to detect the change as quickly as possible, while controlling the average run length (ARL) to false alarm, when the durations of the transient phases are completely unknown. Two algorithms are considered: the dynamic Cumulative Sum (CuSum) algorithm, proposed in earlier work, and a newly constructed weighted dynamic CuSum algorithm. Both algorithms admit recursions that facilitate their practical implementation, and they are adaptive to the unknown transient durations. Specifically, their asymptotic optimality is established with respect to both Lorden\u2019s and Pollak\u2019s criteria as the ARL to false alarm and the durations of the transient phases go to infinity at any relative rate. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the adaptivity of the proposed algorithms and to validate the theoretical results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111241", "output": "Convercast Capacity of Wireless Networks: Achieving Optimal Rate through Power Assignment and Minimum Spanning Tree Scheduling", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

What rate of computation can be maintained, by properly choosing the aggregation tree, the TDMA schedule of the tree edges, and the transmission powers? This can be viewed as the convergecast capacity of a wireless network. We show here that the optimal rate is effectively a constant. This holds even in arbitrary networks, under the physical model of interference. This compares with previous bounds that are logarithmic (e.g., \u03a9(1/log n)). Namely, we show that a rate of \u03a9(1/log* \u0394) is possible, where \u0394 is the length diversity (ratio between the furthest to the shortest distance between nodes). It also implies that the scheduling complexity of wireless connectivity is O(log* \u0394). This is achieved using the natural minimum spanning tree (MST). Our method crucially depends on choosing the appropriate power assignment for the instance at hand, since without power control, only a trivial O(1/n) rate can be guaranteed. We also show that there is a fixed power assignment that allows for a rate of \u0394(1/log log \u0394). Surprisingly, these bounds are essentially best possible. No aggregation network can guarantee a rate better than O(1/log log \u0394) using fixed power assignment. Also, when using arbitrary power control, there are instances whose MSTs cannot be scheduled in fewer than \u03a9(1/log* \u0394) slots.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111242", "output": "\"User-Centered Source Selection: A Decision Support Framework for Optimizing Data Utility\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper we propose a user-driven approach to source selection that seeks to identify sources that are most fit for purpose. The approach employs a decision support methodology to take account of a user\u2019s context, to allow end users to tune their preferences by specifying the relative importance between different criteria, looking to find a trade-off solution aligned with his/her preferences. The approach is extensible to incorporate diverse criteria, not drawn from a fixed set, and solutions can use a subset of the data from each selected source, rather than require that sources are used in their entirety or not at all.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "111243", "output": "\"Adaptive Hybrid Integrator for Wide-Voltage Range \u0394\u03a3 ADCs: A Novel TSHI Architecture\"\n\nor \n\n\"Hybrid Integrator for High-Performance \u0394\u03a3 ADCs: A Two-Step TSHI Approach\"\n\nor \n\n\"Robust TSHI-Based \u0394\u03a3 ADC for Wide-Voltage", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our unsupervised learning approach relies on a new framework of cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks. Different from the image domain transfer problem, our style transfer problem involves two asymmetric functions: a forward function encodes example-based style transfer, whereas a backward function removes the style. We construct two coupled networks to implement these functions - one that transfers makeup style and a second that can remove makeup - such that the output of their successive application to an input photo will match the input. The learned style network can then quickly apply an arbitrary makeup style to an arbitrary photo. We demonstrate the effectiveness on a broad range of portraits and styles.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111245", "output": "Improving the Statistical Accuracy of Cloud Storage Availability Measurements through Bootstrap Averaging and Confidence Interval Analysis.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Though its measurement is included in any cloud monitoring system, the statistical accuracy of such measurements is often neglected. Such measurements may therefore be useless in SLA-related disputed between cloud providers and customers. In this paper Bootstrap Averaging (Bagging) is employed to assess the statistical accuracy when we measure the availability and the number of outages over a single period of time. The distribution and the confidence intervals are reported for a set of major cloud providers, using datasets built from customer reports. By using proper confidence intervals, the compliance of cloud providers with respect to target availability and outage figures can be checked.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111246", "output": "\"Parallelizing Adaboost via Sparse Collaboration: A Low-Communication Approach for Efficient Ensemble Learning\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Parallelizing Ensemble Methods via Sparse Communication\", \"Efficient Adaboost Variants via Distributed Learning\"]\n\n<features>\n\n</features>\n\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Experiments on 12 UCI datasets show that this approach is competitive in terms of generalization error but more efficient than Adaboost and two other parallel approximations of this algorithm.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.07}, {"id": "111247", "output": "Optimization of Simplex Growing Algorithm for Endmember Detection in High-Dimensional Data Sets", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Traditional security countermeasures cannot be directly applied to IoT technologies due to the different standards and communication stacks involved. Moreover, the high number of interconnected devices arises scalability issues; therefore a flexible infrastructure is needed able to deal with security threats in such a dynamic environment.

In this paper, we cope with the two jointly and explore the mutual influence between them. First we propose a convolutional neural network for image denoising which achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Second we propose a deep neural network solution that cascades two modules for image denoising and various high-level tasks, respectively, and use the joint loss for updating only the denoising network via back-propagation. We demonstrate that on one hand, the proposed denoiser has the generality to overcome the performance degradation of different high-level vision tasks. On the other hand, with the guidance of high-level vision information, the denoising network can generate more visually appealing results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating the benefit of exploiting image semantics simultaneously for image denoising and high-level vision tasks via deep learning.

While many solutions exist, they often take a theoretical approach, reasoning about protocol behavior with an abstract model that makes simplifying assumptions about the environment. This approach creates a gap between protocol implementations and the models used during design and analysis. In this paper, we take a system approach to continuous neighbor discovery: starting with the concrete technology of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) we build a protocol, called BLEnd, tailored to its constraints. Moreover, we also consider the very real effects of packet collisions, to our knowledge a first in this domain. Our ultimate goal is to directly empower developers with the ability to determine the optimal protocol configuration for their applications; in this respect, the slotless operation of BLEnd offers richer alternatives than state-of-the-art protocols. Developers specify the minimum discovery probability, the target discovery latency, and the maximum expected node density; these are used by an optimizer tool to parameterize the BLEnd implementation towards maximum lifetime. This paper shows that BLEnd not only achieves the user-specified goals, but does so more efficiently than analogous configurations of competing protocols.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.02}, {"id": "111253", "output": "\"Revisiting the Ancestral Genome Reconstruction: A Novel Approach to Mitigating the Impact of Genome Rearrangements on Phylogenetic Tree Evolution\"\n\nor \n\"Beyond Heuristics: A Novel Framework for Efficient Ancestral Genome Reconstruction in the Presence of Genome Rearrangements\"\n\nor \n\"Efficient", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

More particularly, as the principal forces that have led to major structural changes are genome rearrangements (such as translocations, fusions, and so on), understanding their underlying mechanisms, among other things via the ancestral genome reconstruction, are essential. In this problem, since finding the ancestral genomes that minimize the number of rearrangements in a phylogenetic tree is known to be NP-hard for three or more genomes, heuristics are commonly chosen to obtain approximations of the exact solution. The aim of this work is to show that another path is possible.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111254", "output": "\"Breathing Life into Immersion: Exploring the Potential of Direct Physiological Control in Virtual Reality Games\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Research has explored physiological input for enhancing immersion in single player games through indirectly controlled signals like heart rate or galvanic skin response. In this paper, we propose breathing as a directly controlled physiological signal that can facilitate unique and engaging play experiences through natural interaction in single and multiplayer virtual reality games. Our study (N = 16) shows that participants report a higher sense of presence and find the gameplay more fun and challenging when using our breathing actions. From study observations and analysis we present five design strategies that can aid virtual reality game designers interested in using directly controlled forms of physiological input.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "111255", "output": "Parameter Inference for Constrained Gaussian Processes: A Novel Approach for Efficient State and Parameter Estimation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Many trackers based on Discriminative correlation filter (DCF) have recently obtained promising performance, showing robustness to illumination variation. However, when the target objects undergo significant appearance variation due to intense illumination variation, the features extracted from the object will not have the ability to be discriminated from the background, which causes the tracking algorithm to lose the target in the scene. In this paper, in order to improve the accuracy and robustness of the Discriminative correlation filter (DCF) trackers under intense illumination variation, we propose a very effective strategy by performing multiple region detection and using alternate templates (MRAT). Based on parallel computation, we are able to perform simultaneous detection of multiple regions, equivalently enlarging the search region. Meanwhile the alternate template is saved by a template update mechanism in order to improve the accuracy of the tracker under strong illumination variation. Experimental results on large-scale public benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "111257", "output": "Autonomous Client Participation in Federated Learning: A Minority Game Approach to Reduce Volatility and Enhance Utility", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Most existing works assumed that the central parameter server (PS) determines the participation of clients implying that clients cannot make autonomous participation decisions. The above assumption is unrealistic because the participation in FL training may incur various cost and clients also have strong desire to be rewarded for participation. To address this problem, we design a novel autonomous client participation scheme to incentivize clients. Specifically, the PS provides a certain reward shared among participating clients for each training round. Clients decide whether to participate each FL training round or not based on their own utilities (i.e., reward minus cost). The process can be modeled as a minority game (MG) with incomplete information and clients end up in the minority side win after each training round because the reward of each participating client may not cover its cost if too many clients participate and vice verse. The challenge of autonomous participation schemes lies in lowering the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">volatility</i>\n of participating clients in each round due to the lack of coordination among clients. Through solid analysis, we prove that: 1) The volatility of participating clients in each round is very high under the standard MG scheme. 2) The volatility of participating clients can be reduced significantly under the stochastic MG scheme. 3) A coalition based MG is proposed, which can further reduce the volatility in each round. By conducting extensive experiments in real settings, we demonstrate that the stochastic MG-based scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of utility and volatility, and the coalition MG-based client participation scheme can further boost the utility by 39%-48% and reduce the volatility by 51%\u2013100%. Moreover, our algorithms can achieve almost the same model accuracy as that obtained by centralized client participation algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111258", "output": "\"Relative Transfer Function Estimation from Known Speech Phrases for Effective Far-Field Speech Capture Systems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To design effective spatial filters, we must first estimate the acoustic transfer functions between the source and the microphones. It is difficult to estimate these transfer functions if the source signals are unknown. However, in systems that are activated by a particular speech phrase, we can use that phrase as a pilot signal to estimate the relative transfer functions. Here, we propose a method to estimate relative transfer functions from known speech phrases in the presence of background noise and interference using template matching and time-frequency masking. We find that the proposed method can outperform conventional estimation techniques, but its performance depends on the characteristics of the speech phrase.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111259", "output": "\"Accelerating Pairwise Comparison Generation via Dataset Geometry and Algorithmic Acceleration\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Accelerating Pairwise Comparison Generation via Dataset Geometry\", \"Improving the Efficiency of Pairwise Comparison Label Generation\"]\n[\"Pairwise Comparison Label Generation\", \"Optimizing Pairwise Comparison Objective\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We study a natural experimental design objective, namely, D-optimality, that can be used to identify which $K$ pairwise comparisons to generate. This objective is known to perform well in practice, and is submodular, making the selection approximable via the greedy algorithm. A na\\\"ive greedy implementation has $O(N^2d^2K)$ complexity, where $N$ is the dataset size, $d$ is the feature space dimension, and $K$ is the number of generated comparisons. We show that, by exploiting the inherent geometry of the dataset--namely, that it consists of pairwise comparisons--the greedy algorithm's complexity can be reduced to $O(N^2(K+d)+N(dK+d^2) +d^2K).$ We apply the same acceleration also to the so-called lazy greedy algorithm. When combined, the above improvements lead to an execution time of less than 1 hour for a dataset with $10^8$ comparisons; the na\\\"ive greedy algorithm on the same dataset would require more than 10 days to terminate.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111260", "output": "\"Decomposing the Tight-Span of Totally Split-Decomposable Metrics into Canonical Polytopal Complexes\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper we determine the polytopal structure of the tight-span of a totally split-decomposable (finite) metric. These metrics are a generalization of tree-metrics and have importance within phylogenetics. In previous work, we showed that the cells of the tight-span of such a metric are zonotopes that are polytope isomorphic to either hypercubes or rhombic dodecahedra. Here, we extend these results and show that the tight-span of a totally split-decomposable metric can be broken up into a canonical collection of polytopal complexes whose polytopal structures can be directly determined from the metric. This allows us to also completely determine the polytopal structure of the tight-span of a totally split-decomposable metric. We anticipate that our improved understanding of this structure may lead to improved techniques for phylogenetic inference.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111261", "output": "\"Transforming Adversarial Examples: A Novel Latent Space Defense Against \u21130-Norm Attacks\"\n\nor\n\n\"Pixel-Level Defense: Space Transformation and One-Class Classifiers for \u21130-Norm Attack Mitigation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Latent Space Separation: A Novel Approach to Eliminate Perturbed Pixels", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Prior works of tackling \u21130 attacks can neither eliminate perturbed pixels nor improve the performance of the classifier in the recovered low-quality images. To address the issue, we propose a novel method, called space transformation pixel defender (STPD), to transform any image into a latent space to separate the perturbed pixels from the normal pixels. In particular, this strategy uses a set of one-class classifiers, including Isolation Forest and Elliptic Envelope, to locate the perturbed pixels from adversarial examples. The value of the neighboring normal pixels is then used to replace the perturbed pixels, which hold more than half of the votes from these one-class classifiers. We use our proposed strategy to successfully defend against well-known \u21130-norm adversarial examples in the image classification settings. We show experimental results under the One-pixel Attack (OPA), the Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), and the Carlini Wagner (CW) \u21130-norm attack on CIFAR-10, COVID-CT, and ImageNet datasets. Our experimental results show that our approach can effectively defend against \u21130-norm attacks compared with the most popular defense techniques.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111262", "output": "Maximal Cliques in Intersection Graphs of Homothetic Polygons: A Polynomial Bound for kDIR-CONV Graphs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It is known that convex-set intersection graphs, and also straight-line-segment intersection graphs may have exponentially many maximal cliques. On the other hand, in intersection graphs of homothetic triangles, the maximum number of maximal cliques is polynomial in the number of vertices. We extend the latter result by showing that for every convex polygon P with sides parallel to k directions, every n-vertex graph which is an intersection graph of homothetic copies of P contains at most nk inclusion-wise maximal cliques. We actually prove this result for a more general class of graphs, the so-called kDIR-CONV, which are intersection graphs of convex polygons whose sides are parallel to some fixed k directions. Moreover, we provide lower bounds on the maximum number of maximal cliques and generalize the upper bound to intersection graphs of higher-dimensional convex polytopes in Euclidean space. Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of the polynomial bound on the number of maximal cliques.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111263", "output": "Automating Scheduling in Industrial Engineering: A Comparative Analysis of TieSched and Its Precedents", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In past years, several constraint-based algorithms have been proposed for finding Pareto-optimal solutions to MOCO problems that rely on repeated calls to a constraint solver. Understanding the properties of these algorithms and analyzing their performance is an important problem. Previous work has focused on empirical evaluations on benchmark instances. Such evaluations, while important, have their limitations. Our paper adopts a different, purely theoretical approach, which is based on characterizing the search space into subspaces and analyzing the worst-case performance of a MOCO algorithm in terms of the expected number of calls to the underlying constraint solver. We apply the approach to two important constraint-based MOCO algorithms. Our analysis reveals a deep connection between the search mechanism of a constraint solver and the exploration of the search space of a MOCO problem.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111267", "output": "Forward Secure Blockchain Protocols: Establishing Unconditional Security in Semi-Synchronous Environments Against Fully-Adaptive Corruption", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper proposes a novel local descriptor, called the quaternionic local angular binary pattern (QLABP), for color image classification. QLABP is based on the quaternionic representation (QR) of color images such that it is able to handle all color components holistically as well as consider their relations. Using QR, the quaternionic angular information is further developed to account for more color characteristics. We provide two ways to derive the quaternionic angular information from different perspectives. A pattern encoding operation is finally conducted on the obtained angular information to obtain QLABP. The effectiveness of QLABP has successfully been evaluated by comparing with several state-of-the-art descriptors.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111270", "output": "Biomedical Image Classification with Fused Convolutional Neural Networks: Leveraging Shallow and Deep Features for Accurate Disease Diagnosis", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Therefore, more robust biomedical image analysis technology is needed to meet the requirement of the diagnosis and classification of various kinds of diseases using biomedical images. However, the current biomedical image classification methods and general non-biomedical image classifiers cannot extract more compact biomedical image features or capture the tiny differences between similar images with different types of diseases from the same category. In this paper, we propose a novel fused convolutional neural network to develop a more accurate and highly efficient classifier for biomedical images, which combines shallow layer features and deep layer features from the proposed deep neural network architecture. In the analysis, it was observed that the shallow layers provided more detailed local features, which could distinguish different diseases in the same category, while the deep layers could convey more high-level semantic information used to classify the diseases among the various categories. A detailed comparison of our approach with traditional classification algorithms and popular deep classifiers across several public biomedical image datasets showed the superior performance of our proposed method for biomedical image classification. In addition, we also evaluated the performance of our method in modality classification of medical images using the ImageCLEFmed dataset. Graphical abstract The graphical abstract shows the fused, deep convolutional neural network architecture proposed for biomedical image classification. In the architecture, we can clearly see the feature-fusing process going from shallow layers and the deep layers.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "111271", "output": "\"Conditions for Self-Orthogonality of Quasi-Cyclic Codes with Respect to Symplectic, Euclidean, and Hermitian Inner Products\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Despite the fact that the two components are dependent on each other, prior works often design detection and data association modules separately which are trained with separate objectives. As a result, one cannot back-propagate the gradients and optimize the entire MOT system, which leads to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, recent works simultaneously optimize detection and data association modules under a joint MOT framework, which has shown improved performance in both modules. In this work, we propose a new instance of joint MOT approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The key idea is that GNNs can model relations between variable-sized objects in both the spatial and temporal domains, which is essential for learning discriminative features for detection and data association. Through extensive experiments on the MOT15/16/17/20 datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our GNN-based joint MOT approach and show state-of-the-art performance for both detection and MOT tasks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "111274", "output": "\"Adaptive Compressive Sensing for Efficient Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Minimum Spanning Tree and Mobile Agent-based Greedy Shortest Path Approach\"\n\nor \n\n\"Compressive Data Gathering in WSNs: A Novel Minimum Spanning Tree and Mobile Agent-based Greedy Shortest Path Algorithm with Adaptive Sparsity", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The algorithm first of all uses a sparsity feedback mechanism to accurately estimate the sparsity k of the sensor measurements. It then uses Monte Carlo experiments to determine the minimum number of required measurements Mmin. According to the value of Mmin, the algorithm adaptively adjusts the number of measurements M in order to maximize its recovery performance. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm is superior to other compressive data gathering (CDG) algorithms in terms of energy balance, whilst the adaptive Mmin mechanism guarantees a reconstruction accuracy of at least 99%. Additionally, the sparse binary matrix used in the MST-MA-GSP algorithm offers better recovery of sparse zero-one data than other CDG-based measurement matrices.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111275", "output": "Monitoring and Management Framework for IoT Systems: Integrating AllJoyn, MongoDB, and Storm for Real-Time Analytics and Big Data Storage.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we propose a framework for the monitoring and management of IoT system that integrates the AllJoyn functionalities, useful to interconnect IoT devices, MongoDB, to implement Big Data storage, and Storm, to run real-time data analytics. We implemented the proposed framework and we tested its main functionalities in a smart home application scenario. In our experimentation, we investigated three different data patterns, i.e., regular, event-based, and automated, in order to evaluate performance of our framework in terms of response time under different operational conditions. Experimental results show that the latency of the monitoring and service strongly depends on the type of management application running in the system, whereas it is lightly affected by the data patterns.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111276", "output": "Radar Micro-Doppler Signatures for Gait Classification: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Home Security, Medical Diagnosis, Rehabilitation, and Assisted Living", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Therefore, software services that run on edge infrastructure must rely on failure resilience techniques for uninterrupted delivery. Unique combination of hardware, software, and network characteristics of edge services is not addressed by existing techniques that are designed or tailored for cloud services. In this work, we propose a novel method for evaluating the resilience of replicated edge services, which exploits failure dependencies between edge servers to forecast probability of service interruption. This is done by analyzing historical failure logs of individual servers, modeling temporal dependencies as a dynamic Bayesian network, and inferring the probability that certain number of servers fail concurrently. Furthermore, we propose two replica scheduling algorithms that optimize different criteria in resilient service deployment, namely failure probability and cost of redundancy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "111278", "output": "Automated Cartoonization of 3D Blendshapes for Identity Preservation in Real and Cartoon Face Spaces", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Given a pre-defined blendshape template of the real facial expressions and corresponding cartoonized blendshape template created by an artist, we represent the blendshapes of an identity in the real and cartoon face spaces with the deformations of the blendshape template in each space and learn a mapping between the deformations in the two spaces. To this end, our method decomposes the deformations in each space into two parts: an identity-independent part that is represented with the deformation gradient of the blendshape template, and an identity-dependent part that is modeled by a low-rank linear model. We regress the linear model for the real expressions from a 3D facial expression dataset. An algorithm is then introduced to regress the mapping between the linear models in the two spaces from a small set of real expressions and their cartoonized counterparts. At run time, given the blendshapes of a subject\u2019s real face and her 3D cartoon neutral face, our method automatically constructs the cartoonized blendshapes of the subject with the help of the cartoonized blendshape template and the learned mapping. Our method is user-independent and only requires a small set of 3D cartoonized expressions modeled by the artist for cartoon face rigging. We evaluate our method by creating cartoonized 3D facial animations for variant identities in two different artistic styles. The rigging results demonstrate that our method successfully preserves both artistic styles and personalized expressions of different identities.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111279", "output": "\"Exploiting Performance Complementarity in Automated Algorithm Selection: A Survey of Research and Future Directions for Discrete and Continuous Problems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This is particularly pronounced for computationally hard problems, where in most cases, no single algorithm defines the state of the art; instead, there is a set of algorithms with complementary strengths. This performance complementarity can be exploited in various ways, one of which is based on the idea of selecting, from a set of given algorithms, for each problem instance to be solved the one expected to perform best. The task of automatically selecting an algorithm from a given set is known as the per-instance algorithm selection problem and has been intensely studied over the past 15 years, leading to major improvements in the state of the art in solving a growing number of discrete combinatorial problems, including propositional satisfiability and AI planning. Perinstance algorithm selection also shows much promise for boosting performance in solving continuous and mixed discrete/continuous optimisation problems. This survey provides an overview of research in automated algorithm selection, ranging from early and seminal works to recent and promising application areas. Different from earlier work, it covers applications to discrete and continuous problems, and discusses algorithm selection in context with conceptually related approaches, such as algorithm configuration, scheduling or portfolio selection. Since informative and cheaply computable problem instance features provide the basis for effective perinstance algorithm selection systems, we also provide an overview of such features for discrete and continuous problems. Finally, we provide perspectives on future work in the area and discuss a number of open research challenges.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111280", "output": "Based on the provided abstract and features, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Automorphisms for Efficient Sphere-Packing Bounds in Subblock-Constrained Codes\"\n\nUsing the provided similar abstract-title pairs:\n- \"Sphere-Packing Bounds for Subblock-Constrained Codes\"\n- \"Automorphisms for Efficient Sphere-Packing in Codes", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Such applications built atop reliable or unreliable protocols and they expose different characteristics. Additionally, with regard to the application context (e.g., emergency response operations), several Quality of Service (QoS) requirements must be satisfied. To study QoS in IoT applications, the provision of a generic performance analysis methodology is required. Queueing network models offer a simple modeling environment, which can be used to represent IoT interactions by combining multiple queueing model types for building queueing networks. The resulting networks can be used for performance analysis through analytical or simulation models. In this paper, we present several types of queueing models that represent different QoS settings of IoT interactions, such as intermittent mobile connectivity, message drop probabilities, message availability/validity and resource constrained devices. Using MobileJINQS, we simulate our models demonstrating the significant effect on response times and message success rates when varying QoS settings.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111282", "output": "\"Simultaneous Knowledge Merging for Parallel Incremental Learning: A Weighted Extreme Support Vector Machine Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Parallel Incremental Learning via Simultaneous Knowledge Merging: Reformulation of wESVM for Efficient Scalability\"\n\nor\n\n\"Efficient Parallel Incremental Learning through Simultaneous Knowledge Merging", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Incremental learning can be implemented by merging knowledge from incoming data and parallel learning can be performed by merging knowledge from simultaneous learners. We propose to simultaneously solve the two learning problems with a single process of knowledge merging, and we propose parallel incremental wESVM (weighted Extreme Support Vector Machine) to do so. Here, wESVM is reformulated such that knowledge from subsets of training data can be merged via simple matrix addition. As such, the proposed algorithm is able to conduct parallel incremental learning by merging knowledge over data slices arriving at each incremental stage. Both theoretical and experimental studies show the equivalence of the proposed algorithm to batch wESVM in terms of learning effectiveness. In particular, the algorithm demonstrates desired scalability and clear speed advantages to batch retraining.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111283", "output": "\"Optimizing Green Vehicle Routing in Cold Chain Logistics: A Multi-Cost Approach Considering Full Set of GHG Emissions and Vehicle Maximum Load\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The purpose of this paper is to minimize the total costs, which include vehicle operating cost, quality loss cost, product freshness cost, penalty cost, energy cost and GHG emissions cost. In addition, this research also investigates the effect of changing the vehicle maximum load in relation to cost and GHG emissions. Design/methodology/approach This study develops a mathematical optimization model, considering the total cost and GHG emission. The standard particle swarm optimization and modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO), based on an intelligent optimization algorithm, are applied in this study to solve the routing problem of a real case. Findings The results of this study show the extend of the proposed MPSO performing better in achieving green-focussed vehicle routing and that considering the full set of GHG costs in the objective functions will reduce the total costs and environmental-diminishing emissions of GHG through the comparative analysis. The research outputs also evaluated the effect of different enterprises' conditions (e.g. customers' locations and demand patterns) for better distribution routes planning.

In particular, tutorial dialogue systems that engage students in natural language dialogue can create rich, adaptive interactions. A promising approach to increasing the effectiveness of these systems is to adapt not only to problem-solving performance, but also to a student\u2019s characteristics. Self-efficacy refers to a student\u2019s view of her ability to complete learning objectives and to achieve goals; this characteristic may be particularly influential during tutorial dialogue for computer science education. This article examines a corpus of effective human tutoring for computer science to discover the extent to which considering self-efficacy as measured within a pre-survey, coupled with dialogue and task events during tutoring, improves models that predict the student\u2019s self-reported frustration and learning gains after tutoring. The analysis reveals that students with high and low self-efficacy benefit differently from tutorial dialogue. Student control, social dialogue, and tutor moves to increase efficiency, may be particularly helpful for high self-efficacy students, while for low self-efficacy students, guided experimentation may foster greater learning while at the same time potentially increasing frustration. It is hoped that this line of research will enable tutoring systems for computer science to tailor their tutorial interactions more effectively.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "111285", "output": "\"Adaptive Object Tracking: Overcoming the Challenges of Arbitrary Object Appearance\"\n\nor\n\n\"Object Tracking in the Wild: A Novel Approach to Handling Unseen Objects\"\n\nor\n\n\"Decoupling Object Tracking from Object Classification: A Unified Framework for Arbitrary Object Appearance\"\n\nor\n\n\"Tracking Multiple Objects with a Single Model:", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Accordingly, this work demonstrates an average 1.29x decrease in area overhead, and 55% of the power consumption required of a conventional OoO core. Multicore processors are customary within current generation computing systems. The overall concept of general purpose processing however remains a challenge as architects must provide increased performance for each advancing generation without solely relying on transistor scaling and additional cache levels. Although architects have steered towards heterogeneity to increase the performance and efficiency for a variety of workloads, the fundamental issue of how a single core's architecture may be improved and applied to the multiprocessor domain remains. This work builds upon the concept of Configurable Computing Units (CCU) - a nuanced approach to processor architectures and microarchitectures, employing reconfigurable datapaths and task-based execution. This work improves upon the efficiency of CCUs by applying various new design techniques including branch prediction, variable configuration, an OpenMP programming model, and Berkeley Dwarf testing.

The proposed PNC approach is applied for uplink scenario in binary systems, and the design guideline serves multiple mobile terminals (MTs) and guarantees unambiguous recovery of the message from each MT. We present a novel PNC design criterion first based on binary matrix theories, followed by an adaptive optimal mapping selection algorithm based on the proposed design criterion. In order to reduce the real-time computational complexity, a two-stage search algorithm for the optimal binary PNC mapping matrix is developed. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves lower outage probability with reduced backhaul load compared to practical CoMP schemes which quantize the estimated symbols from a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) based multiuser detector into binary bits at each access point (AP).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111288", "output": "\"Modeling Temporal Causality with Dynamic Bayesian Networks: A Causal Framework for Indirect Influences\"\n\nor\n\n\"Bayesian Networks with Causal Design: Anticipating Indirect Influences for Non-Spurious Results\"\n\nor\n\n\"Temporal Causality in Dynamic Bayesian Networks: A Mathematical Approach to", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The two models describe the process through which individuals adopt a new product. We study the rumour model, that describes the process through which a news is spread in a network. We consider the task of identifying a collection of seed nodes of minimal size to spread a news such that, within a certain time threshold, the news can be spread to a target number of nodes with certain probability. We show that the problem is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that the function that calculates the probability of achieving the coverage threshold is not submodular, and hence conventional optimization techniques based on the submodularity property cannot be applied directly. Nevertheless, we present an algorithm that can provably approximate the size of the optimal seed set.

These information systems bring benefit and security risks to many users. Representative security risks, vulnerabilities are closely related to application software installed in information systems. If a malicious adversary identifies the application software, he can seek the vulnerabilities easily. Thus, to ensure security of information systems, it is necessary to conceal application software installed in information systems. On the other hand, some attempts have been proposed to identify application software or protocol without scanning the payload. These proposed methods can analyze encrypted traffic, because the methods scan traffic patterns such as packet sizes and transmission intervals. While there are some legitimate uses for encrypted traffic analysis, these methods also raise problems about the confidentiality of encrypted traffic. Many researchers proposed countermeasures against traffic analysis to ensure anonymity in a public network. They indicated how to alter traffic patterns in the main. However, a few researcher indicated how to implement the method. Indeed, though previous VPN applications protect payloads against an eavesdropper, do not conceal side channel information including traffic patterns. Our work applies these proposed countermeasures and shows how to implement a secure VPN application that conceals traffic patterns. To alter traffic patterns, it is necessary to control packet sizes. Many popular application based VPN encapsulates packets by TCP or UDP. However, TCP cannot control packet sizes strictly. Though UDP can control packet sizes without difficulty, does not ensure reliable data transmission. A secure application based VPN requires a protocol that can control packet sizes strictly and can ensure reliable data transmission in untrusted networks. SCTP (Stream Control Transmission- - Protocol) is a suitable solution for these requirements. This paper proposes the behavior shaver, an application based layer 3 VPN that conceals traffic patterns using SCTP. The results of experiments show the performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "111291", "output": "\"Unlocking the Potential of Physical-Layer Network Coding in Large Multi-Hop Wireless Networks: A Linear Programming Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Enhancing Throughput in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks via Physical-Layer Network Coding: A Realistic Radio Deployment Study\"\n\nor\n\n\"Scaling Up Physical-Layer Network Coding for Large-S", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Physical-Layer Network Coding was first introduced as a solution to increase the throughput of a two-way relay channel communication. Unlike most wireless communications techniques which try to avoid collisions, PLNC allows two simultaneous transmissions to a common receiver. Such transmitted messages are summed at signal level and then decoded at packet level. In basic topologies, Physical-Layer Network Coding has been shown to significantly enhance the throughput performance compared to classical communications. However, the impact of PLNC in large multi-hop networks remains an open question. We therefore exploit Linear Programming to evaluate the impact of this paradigm in large realistic radio deployments. Our numerical results show that PLNC can increase the throughput in large multi-hop topologies by 30%. Such gains set theoretical benchmarks for designing new access methods and routing protocols to efficiently exploit the Physical-Layer Network Coding concept.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111292", "output": "\"Abstract Interpretation-Based Polyhedral Analysis for Worst-Case Execution Time Estimation in Binary Code\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Despite the agreement on an increasing competitive landscape, the process for realising information technology (IT)-driven operational agility on e-business platforms has received little scrutiny. Through an investigation of M.com, a leading multisided online retailing platform in China, this study provides a clear thesis of resource interdependencies and IT-enabled capabilities forged during operational processes to realise operational agility. Our investigation, observations, and reflections from practice substantiate a model of how a platform like M.com cultivates IT-driven resource-interdependent competencies and capabilities tantamount to realising operational agility. The model shows how IT enables three capabilities-localised, synergistic, and optimised-which reflect the effective co-ordination of three resource interdependencies (pooled, sequential, and reciprocal) during M.com's complex operations and processes, and explicates the consequences. For research, we postulate that IT-enabled operational agility in complex organisational forms, cultivated through the development of resource-interdependent capabilities to deliver effective sensing and response mechanisms, forms effective strategies for the B2C platform in dynamic marketplace conditions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.17}, {"id": "111294", "output": "Facial Expression Recognition: A Novel Feature Selection Approach for Improved Human-Computer Interaction Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Existing prebond test methodologies experience fault detection resolution challenges, large implementation overheads, and most importantly, wide performance fluctuations in presence of process corners, supply voltage, temperature (PVT) variations. In this work, we propose a no-touch TSV test methodology that is resilient against PVT variations, or test environment parameters, thus suitable for industry practical uses. The proposed methodology is based on the idea of charging the TSV RC-network and counting the number of voltage pulses required to charge up the TSV. We undertake a detailed performance evaluation of the test methodology by adopting state-of-the-art industry technology parameters. The major advantage of the test methodology is its strong resilience to PVT variations and simplicity of implementation. In addition, a DFT circuitry is proposed to share among a group of TSVs to lower the design overhead.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111296", "output": "\"Assessing the Impact of Unified Modeling Language (UML) Models on Source-Code Comprehensibility in Comment-Free Java Code\"\n\nor \n\n\"Exploring the Effects of UML Models on Source-Code Understanding: A Comparative Analysis of Analysis and Design Phase Models\"\n\nor \n\n\"The Influence of UML Models", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We have conducted 12 controlled experiments in different experimental contexts and on different sites with participants with different levels of expertise (i.e., Bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s, and PhD students and software practitioners from Italy and Spain). A total of 333 observations were obtained from these experiments. The UML models in our experiments were those produced in the analysis and design phases. The models produced in the analysis phase were created with the objective of abstracting the environment in which the software will work (i.e., the problem domain), while those produced in the design phase were created with the goal of abstracting implementation aspects of the software (i.e., the solution/application domain). Source-code comprehensibility was assessed with regard to correctness of understanding, time taken to accomplish the comprehension tasks, and efficiency as regards accomplishing those tasks. In order to study the global effect of UML models on source-code comprehensibility, we aggregated results from the individual experiments using a meta-analysis. We made every effort to account for the heterogeneity of our experiments when aggregating the results obtained from them. The overall results suggest that the use of UML models affects the comprehensibility of source-code, when it is deprived of comments. Indeed, models produced in the analysis phase might reduce source-code comprehensibility, while increasing the time taken to complete comprehension tasks. That is, browsing source code and this kind of models together negatively impacts on the time taken to complete comprehension tasks without having a positive effect on the comprehensibility of source code. One plausible justification for this is that the UML models produced in the analysis phase focus on the problem domain. That is, models produced in the analysis phase say nothing about source code and there should be no expectation that they would, in any way, be beneficial to comprehensibility. On the other hand, UML models produced in the design phase improve source-code comprehensibility. One possible justification for this result is that models produced in the design phase are more focused on implementation details. Therefore, although the participants had more material to read and browse, this additional effort was paid back in the form of an improved comprehension of source code.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.19}, {"id": "111297", "output": "\"Cost Analysis of Concurrent Objects: A Novel Framework for Distributed Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"A Novel Approach to Cost Analysis for Concurrent Programming: Object-Sensitive Recurrence Equations\"\n\nor\n\n\"Concurrent Cost Analysis: A Framework for Efficient Resource Estimation in Distributed Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"Object-Sensitive Recurrence Equations for", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Concurrent objects form a well-established model for distributed concurrent systems. In this model, objects are the concurrency units that communicate among them via asynchronous method calls. Cost analysis aims at automatically approximating the resource consumption of executing a program in terms of its input parameters. While cost analysis for sequential programming languages has received considerable attention, concurrency and distribution have been notably less studied. The main challenges of cost analysis in a concurrent setting are as follows. First, inferring precise size abstractions for data in the program in the presence of shared memory. This information is essential for bounding the number of iterations of loops. Second, distribution suggests that analysis must infer the cost of the diverse distributed components separately. We handle this by means of a novel form of object-sensitive recurrence equations that use cost centres in order to keep the resource usage assigned to the different components separate. We have implemented our analysis and evaluated it on several small applications that are classical examples of concurrent and distributed programming.

Such an inconsistency state must be repaired by performing corrective actions (e.g. payment of arrears after a retroactive salary increase) either immediately (i.e. at inconsistency detection time) or in a deferred manner, at one or several chosen repair times according to application requirements. The purpose of this work is to deal with deferred and multi-step repair of detected data inconsistencies.Design/methodology/approach - A general approach for deferred and stepwise repair of inconsistencies that result from retroactive updates of currency data (e.g. the salary of an employee) in a valid-time or bitemporal XML database is proposed. The approach separates the inconsistency repairs from the inconsistency detection phase and deals with the execution of corrective actions, which also take into account enterprise's business rules that define some relationships between data.Findings - Algorithms, methods and support data structures for deferred and multi-step inconsistency repair of currency data are presented. The feasibility of the approach has been shown through the development and testing of a system prototype, named Deferred-Repair Manager.Originality/value - The proposed approach implements a new general and flexible strategy for repairing detected inconsistencies in a deferred manner and possibly in multiple steps, according to varying user's requirements and to specifications which are customary in the real world.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111299", "output": "Quantifying Perirhinal Cortex Anatomies with a Multi-Template Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The goal of group recommendation is to capture and distill the preferences of each group member into a single recommendation list that meets the needs of all group members. Existing aggregation functions perform well in harmonious and congruent scenarios, but tend not to generate satisfactory results when group members hold conflicting preferences. Moreover, most of current studies improve group recommendation only based on a single aggregation strategy and explicit trust information is still ignored in group recommender systems. Motivated by these concerns, this paper presents TruGRC, a novel Trust-aware Group Recommendation method with virtual Coordinators, that combines two different aggregation strategies: result aggregation and profile aggregation. As each individual\u2019s preferences are modeled, a virtual user is built as a coordinator to represent the profile aggregation strategy. This coordinator provides a global view of the preferences for all group members by interacting with each user to resolve conflicting preferences. Then, we also model the impact from group members to the virtual coordinator in accordance with personal social influence inferred by trust information on social networks. Group preferences can be easily generated by the average aggregation method under the effect of the virtual coordinator. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with a range of different group sizes show that TruGRC method has significant improvements compared to other state-of-the-art methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111301", "output": "\"Computing Regular Medial Axis Points and Branch Point Detection via Competition Flow Method for Planar Simply-Connected NURBS Boundaries\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

There are three key issues that need to be further addressed on MAC of a NURBS(Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline) curve boundary, namely (1) computation of regular medial axis points; (2) efficient detection of the existence of a branch point where two branches intersect; and (3) convergence and correctness on computing the position of a branch point. This paper presents a competition flow method for medial axis computation of a planar simply-connected NURBS boundary. Different from previous methods which trace a Voronoi Diagram Tree (VDT) in depth-first order from a terminal point, the competition flow method (CFM) traces the corresponding tree in breadth-first order. It has three main contributions. Firstly, it utilizes an optimized method based on previous state-of-art algorithms for computing regular medial axis points, which can achieve a higher computational efficiency. Secondly, it implements a divide-and-conquer method in a natural way by proposing a simple tree technique, in which a VDT is divided into several simple tree structures of level l, l=0,1,\u2026, for competitive medial axis computation. Finally, by using the competition flow method, possible places where branch points are located, are intuitively and efficiently detected and bounded with high precision, which ensures the convergence and the correctness of the computation of the position of a branch point, and also ensures the correctness of the topological structure of the medial axis tree. Numerical examples show that the new method can achieve a better performance compared with several existing methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "111302", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generate the title:\n\n\"Resilient Control of Multi-Agent Systems under Faults on Sensors and Actuators: Adaptive Compensation and H\u221e Control Protocols\"\n\nUsing similar abstract-title pairs from my past works:\n[\"Resilience of Multi-Agent Systems\", \"Fault-Tolerant", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we investigate resilient control of MAS under faults on sensors and actuators. We propose four resilient state feedback based leader\u2013follower tracking protocols. For the case of sensor faults, we develop an adaptive compensation protocol and an H\u221e control protocol. For the case of simultaneous sensor and actuator faults, we further propose an enhanced adaptive compensation protocol and an enhanced H\u221e control protocol. We show the duality between the adaptive compensation protocols and the H\u221e control protocols. For adaptive compensation protocols, faults on sensors and actuators are rejected by using local adaptive sensor and actuator compensators, respectively. Moreover, by employing a static output-feedback design technique, we propose H\u221e control protocols that guarantee bounded L2 gains of certain errors in terms of the L2 norms of fault signals. This further allows us to prove resilience even if sensor faults are unbounded. Finally, simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111303", "output": "Personalized 3D-Printed Smart Eyeglasses for Bilateral Electromyography-Based Automatic Dietary Monitoring.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It can be defined as the source of capital that facilitates cooperation through shared social norms. In this work, we investigate whether and to what extent synchronization aspects of mobile communication patterns are associated with social capital metrics. Interestingly, our results show that our synchronization-based approach well correlates with existing social capital metrics (i.e., Referendum turnout, Blood donations, and Association density), being also able to characterize the different role played by high synchronization within a close proximity-based community and high synchronization among different communities. Hence, the proposed approach can provide timely, effective analysis at a limited cost over a large territory.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111305", "output": "Channel Access Optimization for Block Fading Channels with Unknown Information Using Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms\n\n<similarpairs>\nChannel Access Problem in Block Fading Channels with Unknown Channel Information and Multi-Armed Bandit Approach\nAdaptive Channel Access in Block Fading Channels with Unknown Channel Occupation and Multi-Armed Band", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with the goal of minimizing the outage rate and avoiding frequent channel switching. To achieve this goal, a block based multi-armed bandit (BMAB) learning algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, the BMAB algorithm is extended to cope with the short-term deep channel fading, by exploiting the repetition time diversity (RTD). The regrets of the proposed two algorithms are proved to be logarithmic in time. Performance analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform standard SMAB algorithm in average system outage rate, switching cost and throughput. In addition, the repetition time diversity multi-armed bandit (RTDMAB) algorithm is better than BMAB algorithm in the presence of deep channel fading at the cost of receiving complexity .\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111306", "output": "\"Constructing a Scalable Literature Graph for Algorithmic Discovery: Bridging NLP and Knowledge Representation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Scalable Literature Graph Construction for Enhanced Algorithmic Manipulation and Discovery\"\n\nor\n\n\"Graph-Based Organization of Scientific Literature for Improved Algorithmic Analysis\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We reduce literature graph construction into familiar NLP tasks (e.g., entity extraction and linking), point out research challenges due to differences from standard formulations of these tasks, and report empirical results for each task.

It represents a meta-level study of some the most significant works produced by the AI and Law community, in this case nearly 140 research articles published in the AI and Law journal. It also compares its findings to previous work conducted on evaluation appearing in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL). In addition, the paper highlights works harnessing performance evaluation as one of their chief scientific tools and the means by which they use it. It extends the argument for why evaluation is essential in formal Artificial Intelligence and Law reports such as those in the journal. As in the case of two earlier works on the topic, it pursues answers to the questions: how good is the system, algorithm or proposal?, how reliable is the approach or technique?, and, ultimately, does the method work? The paper investigates the role of performance evaluation in scientific research reports, underscoring the argument that a performance-based 'ethic' signifies a level of maturity and scientific rigor within a community. In addition, the work examines recent publications that address the same critical issue within the broader field of Artificial Intelligence.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "111308", "output": "Optimizing Robust Absolute Deviation Single-Facility Location Problem on Networks with Uncertain Node Weights: A Polynomial Improvement Over Lopez-de-los-Mozos et al.

(2013), an algorithmic approach was presented for the robust (minmax regret) absolute deviation single-facility location problem on networks with node weights which are linear functions of an uncertain or dynamically changing parameter. The problem combines the mean absolute deviation criterion, which is the weighted average of the absolute deviations of individual customer\u2013facility distances from the mean customer\u2013facility distance and is one of the standard measures of \u201cinequality\u201d between the customers, with the minmax regret approach to optimization under uncertainty. The uncertain data are node weights (demands) which are assumed to change in a correlated manner being linear functions of a single uncertain parameter. The analysis in Lopez-de-los-Mozos et al. (2013) presented complexity bounds that are polynomial but too high to be of practical value. In this note, we present improvements of the analysis that significantly reduce the computational complexity bounds for the algorithm.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.77}, {"id": "111309", "output": "\"Unveiling Clone Detection Suitability: A Goal-Driven Approach to Informing Clone Information Needs\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Different clone detection tools report different information about clones. To gauge the suitability of a given clone detector for a particular user objective, we need to determine which information needs implied by the objective a clone detector addresses.

Despite this, reasoning over data-structure properties for low-level heap manipulating programs remains challenging. In this paper we present a constraint-based program analysis that checks data-structure integrity, w.r.t. given target data-structure properties, as the heap is manipulated by the program. Our approach is to automatically generate a solver for properties using the type definitions from the target program. The generated solver is implemented using a Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) extension of built-in heap, integer and equality solvers. A key property of our program analysis is that the target data-structure properties are shape neutral, i.e., the analysis does not check for properties relating to a given data-structure graph shape, such as doubly-linked-lists versus trees. Nevertheless, the analysis can detect errors in a wide range of data-structure manipulating programs, including those that use lists, trees, DAGs, graphs, etc. We present an implementation that uses the Satisfiability Modulo Constraint Handling Rules (SMCHR) system. Experimental results show that our approach works well for real-world C programs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111311", "output": "\"Augmenting Analyst Feedback with Multimodal Interaction Designs for Dimension Reduction and Clustering in Visual Analytics\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These interactions enable analysts to provide feedback to the system, demonstrating relationships that the analyst wishes to find within the projection. However, determining the precise intent of the analyst is a challenge; when an analyst interacts with a projection, the system could infer a variety of possible interpretations. In this work, we explore interaction design considerations for the simultaneous use of dimension reduction and clustering algorithms to address this challenge.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "111312", "output": "\"Deep Learning for Nonlinear ECG Signal Analysis: A Multi-Canonical Approach for Selective Feature Extraction and Classification\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for ECG Signal Processing: A Comparative Study\"\n\"Convolutional Neural Networks for Nonlinear ECG Signal Classification: A Review\"\n\"EC", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, it is very difficult to detect the abnormal ECG characteristics because of the nonlinearity and the complexity of ECG signals from one side, and the noise effect of these signals from the other side, which make it very difficult to perform direct information extraction. Therefore, in this study we propose a very deep convolutional neural network (VDCNN) by using small filters throughout the whole net to reduce the noise affect and improve the performance. Our approach introduces multi-canonical correlation analysis (MCCA), a method to learn selective adaptive layer\u2019s features such that the resulting representations are highly linearly correlated and speed up the training task. Moreover, the Q-Gaussian multi-class support vector machine (QG-MSVM) is introduced for classification, an algorithm which has a better learning performance and generalization ability on ECG signals processing. As a result, we come up with expressively more accurate architecture which is able to differentiate between the normal (NSR) heartbeats and three common types of arrhythmia atrial fibrillation (A-Fib), atrial flutter (AFL), and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) without performing any noise filtering or pre-processing techniques. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111313", "output": "\"Accelerating Logic-Circuit Integration in FPGAs via Haskell-Based High-Level Synthesis\"\n\nor\n\n\"Haskell-Driven HLS for Efficient Field-Programmable Gate Array Design\"\n\nor\n\n\"Unlocking Coarse-Grain Parallelism in FPGAs through Haskell-Embedded High-Level Synthesis\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

High-level synthesis (HLS) is now widely used to implement complex FPGA applications to increase design efficiency, taking the place of typical register-transfer level (RTL) design. Most HLS tools support C-like languages such as C/C++, SystemC, OpenCL, and CUDA. However, coarse-grain parallelism from a C-like language cannot be extracted easily, hence some tools use explicitly parallel programming languages to design hardware. However, all such tools rely on the programmer to correctly parallelize and perform optimizations on the application, which often forces the programmer to acquire hardware-design knowledge.   In this work, we propose an HLS environment for FPGAs using the embedded domain-specific language (DSL) of Haskell as the design language. Haskell is a pure functional language that has the features of referential transparency and no side effects. Hence, it is better for mapping to hardware. Higher-order functions such as map, zipWith, and reduce are useful for allowing a parallel design pattern to automatically extract parallelism in the design. In our environment, the embedded DSL program is compiled to the LLVM intermediate representation (LLVM IR), which is then integrated into the open-source HLS tool, LegUp. LegUp synthesizes the LLVM IR to Verilog HDL, which can be merged with the FPGA design tools of the FPGA vendor.   The evaluation results show that our proposed implementation achieves 3.00 and 4.96 times speed-up in two benchmarks, array addition and summation of array, respectively, relative to a C-like language design.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111314", "output": "Based on the provided similar abstract-title pairs:\n[\"Teleoperation using motion primitives for long-duration control\", \"Adaptive teleoperation approach for mobile systems\", \"Predict-and-adapt approach for assistive teleoperation\"]\n\nand the features:\n[\"Use of technical terms such as 'teleoperation','motion primitives', 'predict-and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this work, we present a novel adaptive teleoperation approach that is amenable to mobile systems using motion primitives for long-duration teleoperation, such as exploration using mobile vehicles or walking for humanoid systems. We first describe teleoperation using motion primitives, which are dynamically feasible and safe local trajectories based on a kinematic or dynamic model. We take a predict-and-adapt approach to assistive teleoperation, whereby adaptation is based on the predicted user intent. By representing the operator as an optimizing controller, a probabilistic distribution can be constructed for the available future actions based on some reward function. Adaptation is provided in the form of subsampling, which tailors the set of available actions based on the likelihood of action selection. We describe the framework for general systems and delineate the extrapolation to ground, air, and legged mobile robots, and demonstrate generalizability of this framework on two systems via simulation and experimentation; namely, a quadrotor micro air vehicle, and a simulated 3D humanoid system. Both systems show provably better performance in teleoperation by measures of behavioral entropy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111315", "output": "\"Optimizing Delegate Experience through Intelligent Scheduling for Academic Conferences\"\n\nor \n\n\"Automated Conference Scheduling for Enhanced User Experience Based on Keyword Preferences\"\n\nor \n\n\"Intelligent Conference Agent: A Novel Approach to Personalized Scheduling for Academic Delegates\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This entails two major challenges: (a) identifying preferences of users; and (b) given the preferences, generating a schedule that optimizes his preferences. In this paper, we specifically focus on academic conferences, where users are prompted to input their preferred keywords. Our key contribution is an integrated conference scheduling agent that automatically recognizes user preferences based on keywords, provides a list of recommended talks and optimizes user schedule based on these preferences. To demonstrate the utility of our integrated conference scheduling agent, we first demonstrated the app in the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2015) and conducted a survey to collect some data, which are used to verify the results presented in this paper. It is able to provide well calibrated results with respect to precision, accuracy and recall. We also tested the app in the 2015 WI-IAT International Conference (Singapore). The android and web-based apps have been demonstrated and deployed in AAMAS 2016 (Singapore) with positive responses from the users.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.99}, {"id": "111316", "output": "\"Game-Theoretic Paradigms for Optimizing Resource Allocation and Utility Maximization in IoT Networks: A Review of Recent Solutions and Future Research Directions\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the research on storage and computation power for IoT is still in its early stages. The game theory converts the interaction between two IoT devices into a game where the conflict is resolved by utilizing the game\u2019s equilibrium conditions. Our goal with the game theory is to maximize the utility for every device in the IoT network. In this article, we review the recent game-theory-based solutions proposed in IoT networks. We summarize game theory concepts and categorize the common game models for ease of understanding for the reader. Later, we focus on analyzing solutions proposed in resource allocation, task scheduling, node selection, quality of service, and network security. Finally, we summarize research challenges and propose future research directions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "111317", "output": "\"Counterfeit Integrated Circuit Detection and Prevention Framework: A Multi-Functional On-Chip Aging Sensor and Post-Fabrication Authentication Methodology\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Moreover, they pose an immense economic, security, and safety threat. We propose a comprehensive detection and prevention framework consisting of a multi-functional on-chip aging sensor, and post-fabrication authentication methodology. This framework targets several classes of counterfeit ICs, such as recycled, remarked, out-of-spec, cloned, and over-produced ICs. First, the new sensor consists of both antifuse memory and aging sensors. To reduce reference-circuit related area-overhead, the initial electronic properties of sensor circuits are stored in a global database, accessed by unique chip via challenge-response pairs. Second, this work consists of a two aging-sensor approach, based on IC wear-out effects, using a recently proposed electromigration (EM) aging sensor and a ring oscillator aging sensor. This method can be effective for chip usage estimation of both short and long time periods. Hence, it can serve as a more accurate timer for the chip to meter the long term usage, which can allow for timed services of some functionality of a chip, in addition to detection of the recycled/remark ICs. Third, on top of the new sensor, we propose a new post-fabrication authentication methodology to detect and prevent non-defective counterfeit ICs. All fabricated ICs will be registered in a global database and activated with a unique chip ID, which is written into the antifuse memory. Simulation results show that the combined aging sensors have a high degree of accuracy when compared to traditional on-chip sensors.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111318", "output": "Optimal Classification Tree Learning via Dynamic Programming and Search: A Scalable Approach for High-Accuracy Models with Constrains", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Heuristic methods are traditionally used to quickly produce models with reasonably high accuracy. A commonly criticised point, however, is that the resulting trees may not necessarily be the best representation of the data in terms of accuracy and size. In recent years, this motivated the development of optimal classification tree algorithms that globally optimise the decision tree in contrast to heuristic methods that perform a sequence of locally optimal decisions. We follow this line of work and provide a novel algorithm for learning optimal classification trees based on dynamic programming and search. Our algorithm supports constraints on the depth of the tree and number of nodes. The success of our approach is attributed to a series of specialised techniques that exploit properties unique to classification trees. Whereas algorithms for optimal classification trees have traditionally been plagued by high runtimes and limited scalability, we show in a detailed experimental study that our approach uses only a fraction of the time required by the state-of-the-art and can handle datasets with tens of thousands of instances, providing several orders of magnitude improvements and notably contributing towards the practical use of optimal decision trees.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "111319", "output": "\"Establishing a Standardized Framework for Evaluating Hardware Intellectual Property Obfuscation Techniques\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Due to the lack of standard benchmarks, proposed techniques by researchers and practitioners in the community are evaluated by existing benchmark suites such as ISCAS-85, ISCAS-89, and ITC-99. These open source benchmarks, though widely utilized, are not necessarily suitable for the purpose of evaluating hardware obfuscation techniques. In this context, we believe that it is important to establish a set of well-defined benchmarks, on which the effectiveness of new and existing obfuscation techniques and attacks on them can be compared. In this paper, we describe a set of such benchmarks obfuscated with some popular methods that we created to facilitate this need. These benchmarks have been made publicly available on Trust-Hub web portal. Moreover, we provide the first evaluation of several obfuscation approaches based on the metrics and existing attacks using this new suite. Finally, we discuss our observations and guidance for future work in hardware obfuscation and benchmarking.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "111320", "output": "Reformulating Bilevel Linear Integer Programs using Strong Duality: Exploiting Binary Expansion of Upper-Level Integer Variables", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The most common technique to reformulate such programs as a single-level problem is to replace the lower-level linear optimization problem by Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. Employing the strong duality (SD) property of linear programs is an alternative method to perform such transformations. In this note, we describe two SD-based reformulations where the key idea is to exploit the binary expansion of upper-level integer variables. We compare the performance of an off-the-shelf MIP solver with the SD-based reformulations against the KKT-based one and show that the SD-based approaches can lead to orders of magnitude reduction in computational times for certain classes of instances.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111321", "output": "Instant Restore of Database Systems with Real-Time Read/Write Access to Partially Restored Data", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Previous work introduced a technique called single-pass restore, which increases restore bandwidth and thus substantially decreases time to repair. Instant restore goes further as it permits read/write access to any data on a device undergoing restore-even data not yet restored-by restoring individual data segments on demand. Thus, the restore process is guided primarily by the needs of applications, and the observed mean time to repair is effectively reduced from several hours to a few seconds. This paper presents an implementation and evaluation of instant restore. The technique is incrementally implemented on a system starting with the traditional ARIES design for logging and recovery. Experiments show that the transaction latency perceived after a media failure can be cut down to less than a second. The net effect is that a few \"nines\" of availability are added to the system using simple and low-overhead software techniques.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111322", "output": "Optimal Static Distributed Control for Linear Discrete-Time Deterministic and Stochastic Systems: A Comparative Study of Centralized and Decentralized Approaches", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To protect the security and privacy of the data, data should be stored in encrypted form. This brings forth new challenges: how to allow different users to access only the authorized part of the data without decryption of the data. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) offers fine-grained access control policy over encrypted data such that users can decrypt successfully only if their attributes satisfy the policy. However, one drawback of ABE is that the computational cost grows linearly with the complexity of ciphertext policy or the number of attributes. The situation becomes worse for mobile devices with limited computing resources. To solve this problem, we adopt the offline/online technique combining with the verifiable outsourced computation technique to propose a new ciphertext-policy ABE scheme using bilinear groups in prime order, supporting the offline/online key generation and encryption, as well as the verifiable outsourced decryption. As a result, most computations of key generation and encryption can be executed offline, and the majority of computational workload in decryption can be outsourced to third parties. The scheme is selectively chosen-plaintext attack-secure in the standard model. We also provide the proof of verifiability on outsourced decryption. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can effectively reduce the computational cost imposed on resource-constrained devices.

Indeed, there is an increasing need to develop ad hoc distributed applications. However, the latter are now subject to new type of failures with more frequency. Therefore, fault tolerance is a crucial property to guarantee in this context and particularly for MANETs which are considered in this paper. We propose for this effect, a new hybrid checkpointing and rollback recovery protocols for flat MANETs, called two phases algorithm of checkpointing for adhoc networks 2PACA networks. This protocol operates in the background of the distributed application and allows the latter to recover from a failure and to resume its processing. We advocate the use of our protocol in the context of flat MANETs and evaluate its performances by reporting some exhaustive simulation results performed on NS2 platform.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.7}, {"id": "111325", "output": "Reach-Avoid Games on Rectangular Domains: Analyzing Barrier and Optimal Strategies for Defenders and Attacker Using Voronoi Diagrams and Apollonius Circles", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The attacker aims to reach a specified edge of the game domain boundary, while the defenders strive to prevent that by capturing the attacker. First, we are concerned with the barrier, which is the boundary of the reach-avoid set, splitting the state space into two disjoint parts: 1) defender dominance region (DDR) and 2) attacker dominance region (ADR). For the initial states lying in the DDR, there exists a strategy for the defenders to intercept the attacker regardless of the attacker's best effort, while for the initial states lying in the ADR, the attacker can always find a successful attack strategy. We propose an attack region method to construct the barrier analytically by employing Voronoi diagram and Apollonius circle for two kinds of speed ratios. Then, by taking practical payoff functions into considerations, we present optimal strategies for the players when their initial states lie in their winning regions, and show that the ADR is divided into several parts corresponding to different strategies for the players. Numerical approaches, which suffer from inherent inaccuracy, have already been utilized for multiplayer reach-avoid games, but computational complexity complicates solving such games and consequently hinders efficient on-line applications. However, this method can obtain the exact formulation of the barrier and is applicable for real-time updates.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.7}, {"id": "111326", "output": "\"Designing Accessible Cultural Heritage: Exploring Material Qualities and Interaction Modalities for Visually Impaired Audiences\"\n\nor\n\n\"Tactile Adaptations for Cultural Heritage: Investigating Material Choices and User-Centered Interaction Designs\"\n\nor\n\n\"Enhancing Cultural Heritage Accessibility through Tactile Technologies: A Study of", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Under this assumption, the belief state is a probability distribution over a finite number of states. We optimize a control-tree where each branch assumes a given state-hypothesis. The control-tree optimization uses the probabilistic belief state information. This leads to policies more optimized with respect to likely states than unlikely ones, while still guaranteeing robust constraint satisfaction at all times. We apply the method to both linear and non-linear MPC with constraints. The optimization of the control-tree is decomposed into optimization subproblems that are solved in parallel leading to good scalability for high number of state-hypotheses. We demonstrate the real-time feasibility of the algorithm on two examples and show the benefits compared to a classical MPC scheme optimizing w.r.t. one single hypothesis.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111328", "output": "Optimizing GPU Utilization through VLIW-Inspired JIT Compilation for Efficient ML Inference.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As ML inference is increasingly time-bounded by tight latency SLOs, increasing data parallelism is not an option. The need for better efficiency motivates GPU multiplexing. Furthermore, existing GPU programming abstractions force programmers to micro-manage GPU resources in an early-binding, context-free fashion. We propose a VLIW-inspired Out-of-Order (OoO) Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler that coalesces and reorders execution kernels at runtime for throughput-optimal device utilization while satisfying latency SLOs. We quantify the inefficiencies of space-only and time-only multiplexing alternatives and demonstrate an achievable 7.7x opportunity gap through spatial coalescing.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111329", "output": "Transient Gestures for Enhanced Multilevel Navigation on Touchscreens: A Study on Transient Pan and Zoom Manipulation.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Leveraging typical touchscreen support for additional contact points, we design our transient gestures such that they co-exist with traditional pan and zoom interaction. We show that our transient pan-and-zoom reduces repetition in multi-level navigation and facilitates rapid movement between document states.

Although this technique can significantly improve overall performance, most of the state-of-the-art value prediction approaches require high hardware cost, which is the main obstacle for its wide adoption in current processors. To tackle this issue, we revisit load value prediction as an efficient alternative to the classical approaches that predict all instructions. By speculating only on loads, the pressure over shared resources (e.g., the Physical Register File) and the predictor size can be substantially reduced (e.g., more than 90% reduction compared to recent works). We observe that existing value predictors cannot achieve very high performance when speculating only on load instructions. To solve this problem, we propose a new, accurate and low-cost mechanism for predicting the values of load instructions: the Address-first Value-next Predictor with Value Prefetching (AVPP). The key idea of our predictor is to predict the load address first (which, we find, is much more predictable than the value) and to use a small non-speculative Value Table (VT)\u2014indexed by the predicted address\u2014to predict the value next. To increase the coverage of AVPP, we aim to increase the hit rate of the VT by predicting also the load address of a future instance of the same load instruction and prefetching its value in the VT. We show that AVPP is relatively easy to implement, requiring only 2.5% of the area of a 32KB L1 data cache. We compare our mechanism with five state-of-the-art value prediction techniques, evaluated within the context of load value prediction, in a relatively narrow out-of-order processor. On average, our AVPP predictor achieves 11.2% speedup and 3.7% of energy savings over the baseline processor, outperforming all the state-of-the-art predictors in 16 of the 23 benchmarks we evaluate. We evaluate AVPP implemented together with different prefetching techniques, showing additive performance gains (20% average speedup). In addition, we propose a new taxonomy to classify different value predictor policies regarding predictor update, predictor availability, and in-flight pending updates. We evaluate these policies in detail.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "111331", "output": "Temporal Indexing with Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Clinical Notes\nTemporal Indexing with Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Temporal Relations in Clinical Notes", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Some temporal relation shared tasks for the medical entity in English clinical notes have been organized in the past few years, such as the 2012 i2b2 NLP challenge, 2015 and 2016 clinical TempEval challenges. In these tasks, many heuristics rule-based and machine learning-based systems have been developed. In recent years, the deep neural network models have shown great potential on many problems including the relation classification.MethodsIn this paper, we propose a recurrent convolutional neural network (RNN-CNN) model for the temporal indexing task, which consists of four layers: input layer - generates representation for each context word of medical entities or temporal expressions; LSTM (long-short term memory) layer - learns the context information of each word in a sentence and outputs a new word representation sequence; CNN layer - extracts meaningful features from a sentence and outputs a new representation for medical entity or temporal expression; Output layer - takes the representations of medical entity, temporal expression and relation features as input and classifies the temporal relation. Finally, the time or time interval for each medical entity can be directly selected according to the probability of each temporal relation predicted by above model.ResultsTo investigate the performance of our RNN-CNN model for the temporal indexing task, several baseline methods were also employed, such as the rule-based, support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) methods. Experiments conducted on a manually annotated corpus (including 563 clinical notes with 12,611 medical entities and 4006 temporal expressions) show that RNN-CNN model achieves the best F1-score of 75.97% for temporal relation classification and the best accuracy of 71.96% for temporal indexing.ConclusionsNeural network methods perform much better than the traditional rule-based and SVM-based method, which can capture more semantic information from the context of medical entities and temporal expressions. Besides, all our methods perform much better for the accurate time indexing than the time interval indexing, so how to improve the performance for time interval indexing will be the main focus in our future work.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.69}, {"id": "111332", "output": "Based on the provided features, I can generate a title for the abstract.

Each operation will require one or more simultaneous input data streams and produce one or more output streams, where the processing may shrink or expand the data rates upon completion. Multiple tasks can be co-located on the same server and compete for limited resources. Effective in-network processing and resource management in a distributed heterogeneous environment is critical to achieving better scalability and provision of quality of service. In this paper, we study the distributed resource allocation problem for a synchronous fork and join processing network, with the goal of achieving the maximum total utility of output streams. Using primal and dual based optimization techniques, we propose several decentralized iterative algorithms to solve the problem, and design protocols that implement these algorithms. These algorithms have different strengths in practical implementation and can be tailored to take full advantage of the computing capabilities of individual servers. We show that our algorithms guarantee optimality and demonstrate through simulation that they can adapt quickly to dynamically changing environments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.9}, {"id": "111333", "output": "\"Deep Structured Semantic Models for Large-Scale Web Search: A Deep Learning Approach to Clickthrough Prediction\"\n\nor\n\n\"Scaling Latent Semantic Models for Web Search: A Deep Learning Framework for Efficient Clickthrough Prediction\"\n\nor\n\n\"Deep Learning for Large-Scale Web Search: A Novel Approach to Clickthrough Prediction and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this study we strive to develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space where the relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between them. The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query using the clickthrough data. To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a real-world data set. Results show that our best model significantly outperforms other latent semantic models, which were considered state-of-the-art in the performance prior to the work presented in this paper.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111334", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\nSecure Computation Offloading with Eavesdropper Considerations\nSecure Computation Offloading for Multi-Eavesdropper Environments\nEavesdropper-Aware Secure Computation Offloading\nSecure Computation Offloading Against", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Furthermore, we design a requirement satisfaction model by exploring practical variations in user request patterns for security provisioning, delay reduction and energy saving. Based on these, we propose a satisfaction-maximized secure computation offloading (SMax-SCO) scheme, and then formulate an optimization problem aiming at maximizing users\u2019 requirement satisfactions subject to secrecy offloading rate, tolerable delay, task workload and maximum power constraints. Since the optimization problem is nonconvex, we present an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm to obtain suboptimal solutions. We demonstrate that the proposed SMax-SCO scheme achieves a significant improvement in security performance and requirement satisfaction compared with existing schemes. Moreover, we conclude that SMax-SCO can resist eavesdropping attacks of multiple eavesdroppers and even colluding eavesdroppers.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111335", "output": "Reinforced Mnemonic Reader for Enhanced Machine Reading Comprehension: Refining Attention and Convergence through Dynamic-Critical Reinforcement Learning", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, such demonstrations are often imperfect since collecting optimal ones is costly. To effectively learn from imperfect demonstrations, we propose a novel approach that utilizes confidence scores, which describe the quality of demonstrations. More specifically, we propose two confidence-based IL methods, namely two-step importance weighting IL (2IWIL) and generative adversarial IL with imperfect demonstration and confidence (IC-GAIL). We show that confidence scores given only to a small portion of sub-optimal demonstrations significantly improve the performance of IL both theoretically and empirically.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111339", "output": "\"Optical Jamming Aided Secrecy Enhancement for Secure Visible Light Communication Systems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Certainly, not only should the individual neural networks in an ensemble be different from each other, but also cooperative as well. While there are many methods available for training a set of neural networks to be different, only few of them have addressed the issue of cooperations among the trained individual neural networks. In this paper, different learning targets are set for the individual neural networks on learning the same data point in negative correlation learning. In the original negative correlation learning, the same error function was applied on all the individual neural networks in an ensemble. It would lead the individual neural networks to be either too similar or too different if the learning would be conducted for long. With different learning targets, negative correlation learning would be able to have a stable performance even if the learning would have to be run for long. Such stable performance were analyzed in terms of both performance and cooperations in this paper.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111342", "output": "\"Devirtualized Memory: Simplifying High-Performance Computing with Direct Physical Memory Access\"\n\nor\n\n\"Overcoming Virtual Memory Overheads with Devirtualized Memory: A Solution for Accelerators and CPUs\"\n\nor\n\n\"Direct Physical Memory Access for High-Performance Computing: The Devirtualized Memory Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For accelerators, shared virtual memory (VM) promises to simplify programming and provide safe data sharing with CPUs. Unfortunately, the overheads of virtual memory, which are high for general-purpose processors, are even higher for accelerators. Providing accelerators with direct access to physical memory (PM) in contrast, provides high performance but is both unsafe and more difficult to program. We propose Devirtualized Memory (DVM) to combine the protection of VM with direct access to PM. By allocating memory such that physical and virtual addresses are almost always identical (VA==PA), DVM mostly replaces page-level address translation with faster region-level Devirtualized Access Validation (DAV). Optionally on read accesses, DAV can be overlapped with data fetch to hide VM overheads. DVM requires modest OS and IOMMU changes, and is transparent to the application. Implemented in Linux 4.10, DVM reduces VM overheads in a graph-processing accelerator to just 1.6% on average. DVM also improves performance by 2.1X over an optimized conventional VM implementation, while consuming 3.9X less dynamic energy for memory management. We further discuss DVM's potential to extend beyond accelerators to CPUs, where it reduces VM overheads to 5% on average, down from 29% for conventional VM.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111343", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\nTemporal Forecasting for Public Health: A Deep Learning Approach\nTemporal Forecasting for Predicting Epidemic Outbreaks\nPredicting Time-Series Data with Deep Learning Techniques\nTime-Series Prediction for Epidemiological Data\n</similarpairs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The temporal nature of epidemiology data and the need for real-time prediction by the system makes the problem residing in the category of time-series forecasting or prediction. While traditional autoregressive (AR) methods and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) have been actively studied for solving this problem, deep learning techniques have not been explored in this domain. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework, for the first time, to predict epidemiology profiles in the time-series perspective. We adopt Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture the long-term correlation in the data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to fuse information from data of different sources. A residual structure is also applied to prevent overfitting issues in the training process. We compared our model with the most widely used AR models on USA and Japan datasets. Our approach provides consistently better results than these baseline methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111344", "output": "Mobility and Isolation in Mobile Systems: A Novel Approach to Scheduling Ambients\n\nor\n\nMobility and Ambient Isolation: A Priority Scheduling Framework for Mobile Systems\n\nor\n\nEnabling Isolation in Mobile Systems through Ambient Mobility Modeling\n\nor\n\nAmbient Mobility and Isolation: A Priority-Based Scheduling", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Inspired by event-based formal models and the ambient calculus, we first propose the two types of special events, entering and exiting an ambient, as movement events to model and analyze mobility. Based on mobility, we then introduce the notion of the isolation of mobile objects for ambients. To ensure the isolation, a priority policy needs to be used to schedule the movement of mobile objects. However, traditional scheduling policies focus on task scheduling and depend on the strong hypothesis: The scheduled tasks are independent\u2014that is, the scheduled tasks do not affect each other. In a practical mobile system, mobile objects and ambients interact with each other. It is difficult to separate a mobile system into independent tasks. We finally present an automatic approach for generating a priority scheduling policy without considering the preceding assumption. The approach can guarantee the isolation of the mobile objects for ambients in a mobile system. Experiments demonstrate these results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111345", "output": "Using the provided similar abstract-title pairs, I can infer that the title should have a similar structure and style.

This can be due to the fragility of the artefacts themselves or due to the people discussing them being in different locations. Interacting with virtual representations of artefacts is a solution to the problem, but digital experiences have typically lacked many of the qualities that are so successful in engaging museum learners with physical artefacts. In this paper, we introduce our theory that hands-on, reality-based interaction using a tablet interface offers a much more engaging way for collaborators to explore and discuss virtual artefacts than the more traditional desktop interface-based experience, and that this increase in engagement will potentially lead to learning outcomes for the collaborators.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111346", "output": "\"Efficient Test Generation for Reconfigurable Scan Chains: A Finite State Automaton Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Greedy Search for High-Quality Test Sequences in Reconfigurable Scan Chains\"\n\nor\n\n\"Modeling and Optimizing Test Generation for Semiconductor Devices: A Finite State Automaton-Based Approach\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The situation led to the definition of standards, such as the IEEE 1687, for designing the required infrastructures, and the proposal of techniques to test them. So far, most of the test-generation approaches are either too computationally demanding to be applied in complex cases, or too approximate to yield high-quality tests. This paper exploits a recent idea: the state of a generic reconfigurable scan chain is modeled as a finite state automaton and a low-level fault, as an incorrect transition; it then proposes a new algorithm for generating a functional test sequence able to detect all incorrect transitions far more efficiently than previous ones. Such an algorithm is based on a greedy search, and it is able to postpone costly operations and eventually minimize their number. Experimental results on ITC`16 benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach is broadly applicable; has limited computational requirements; and the test sequences are order of magnitudes shorter than the ones previously generated by approximate methodologies.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.12}, {"id": "111347", "output": "Collective Problem-Solving through Wisdom of Crowds: Harnessing Collective Intelligence for Enhanced Performance", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For this aim, we first introduce a general framework of CI involving key characteristics of intelligent collectives. Next, we focus on the problem of how diversity and collective cardinality influence collective performance. Then, its applications, which are widely used such as prediction markets and Delphi method, will be presented. Furthermore, some research challenges on the capacity of combining CI with other research fields such as machine learning and social networks are also discussed.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111348", "output": "\"Scaling the Planetary Information Infrastructure: A Moore's Law Perspective\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

During life, all components undergo degenerative changes, which may in some cases cause severe, chronic and debilitating low back pain. The main diagnostic challenge is to locate the pain generator, and degenerated IVDs have been identified to act as such. Accurate and robust segmentation of IVDs is therefore a prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis and quantification of IVD degeneration, and can be also used for computer-assisted planning and simulation in spinal surgery. In this paper, we present a novel fully automated framework for supervised segmentation of IVDs from three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) spine images. By considering global intensity appearance and local shape information, a landmark-based approach is first used for the detection of IVDs in the observed image, which then initializes the segmentation of IVDs by coupling deformable models with convolutional networks (ConvNets). For this purpose, a 3D ConvNet architecture was designed that learns rich high-level appearance representations from a training repository of IVDs, and then generates spatial IVD probability maps that guide deformable models towards IVD boundaries. By applying the proposed framework to 15 3D MR spine images containing 105 IVDs, quantitative comparison of the obtained against reference IVD segmentations yielded an overall mean Dice coefficient of 92.8%, mean symmetric surface distance of 0.4 mm and Hausdorff surface distance of 3.7 mm.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "111350", "output": "Contextualizing Development Practices in New Zealand: A Comparative Analysis of Methodologies and Release Processes", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Aim: We aim at understanding development processes and practices in New Zealand, a country with a relatively small but growing software sector. We are particularly interested in methods and practices used in such environment, the implementation technologies software development professionals use, how professionals ensure software quality, and how they manage software release processes. Method: We conducted a descriptive survey targeting individual software development professionals working in New Zealand software companies. Results: New Zealand professionals use similar methodologies as professionals in other countries. Popular programming languages differ somewhat to popular languages in other rankings. Quality assurance is rather ad-hoc and the release process is inspired by agile software development principles. Conclusions: Our findings highlight some differences of the New Zealand software industry to other countries. Furthermore, we identified some strengths and weaknesses related to processes and practices. Our findings can help software professionals and organizations reflect on (and potentially adjust) the way they work.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111351", "output": "k-Optimal Meeting Points for Public Transit: Efficient Geometric Approaches for Minimizing Aggregate Detour Distances in Group Travel", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, recent studies have shown that many IT-enabled asymmetric partnerships often fail because the organizations do not effectively manage the involved collaboration risks. Most organizations focus on the strategic aspect of whether partners behave cooperatively or competitively, while paying scant attention to the operational aspect of bringing together partner contributions through coordination. To examine this problem, we report on a case study of two hub-spoke networks that used telemedicine to facilitate expertise sharing and decision making about stroke treatment at emergency departments in rural hospitals (spokes) based on information exchanges with remote neurologists at academic medical centers (hubs). As a result, we contribute to the inter-organizational information systems literature by explaining how organizations in IT-enabled asymmetric partnerships manage collaboration risks. We demonstrate how partners in such relationships perceive and approach strategic cooperation and operational coordination risks differently. We also explain how collaboration interactions change over time as the partners manage risks based on needs and resource endowments. Drawing on these findings, we provide guidance to organizations on how to manage sustainable IT-enabled asymmetric partnerships in general, and telestroke networks in particular.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111353", "output": "\"Characterizing Generalized Degrees of Freedom in Symmetric MIMO Interference Channels with Finite Precision CSIT\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, using a single type of omics data suffers from data noise since individual omics type represents only one single view of bladder cancer patients. In this study, we have estimated bladder cancer prognosis by integrating multi-omics data including RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, DNA methylation, and copy number variation data. To effectively integrate the multi-omics data, we have developed a transfer-learning based Cox proportional hazards network (TCAP) by utilizing an integrated loss function consisted of two modules: the data reconstruction module to ensure learning a representative hidden layer for the input data, and the proportional hazard module to estimate patients' risks. The experiments on 336 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that our method achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.665, which is higher than previous methods. In consideration of the expense to obtain multi-omics data in clinics, we fitted the risks estimated from TCAP by training an XGboost model based on mRNA data only. The model achieved a reasonable C-index of 0.621, and independent tests on three additional datasets achieved an average C-index of 0.637 +/-\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\pm$$\\end{document} 0.047.

In summary, the results indicated that we have constructed an accurate and robust model for predicting bladder cancer outcomes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "111356", "output": "\"Intelligent Collaboration in Movie Trailer Creation: A Novel Paradigm for Emotional Pattern Recognition and Disruptive Content Generation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We introduce an intelligent system designed to understand and encode patterns and types of emotions in horror movies that are useful in trailers. We perform multi-modal semantics extraction including audio visual sentiments and scene analysis and employ a statistical approach to model the key defining components that characterize horror movie trailers. The system was applied on a full-length feature film, \"Morgan'' released in 2016 where the system identified 10 moments as best candidates for a trailer. We partnered with a professional filmmaker who arranged and edited each of the moments together to construct a comprehensive trailer completing the entire processing as well as the final trailer assembly within 24 hours. We discuss disruptive opportunities for the film industry and the tremendous media impact of the AI trailer. We confirm the effectiveness of our trailer with a very supportive user study. Finally based on our close interaction with the film industry, we also introduce and investigate the novel paradigm of tropes within the context of movies for advancing content creation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111357", "output": "Indoor Relocalization Using Dual-Stream Convolutional Neural Networks for RGB-D Images: A Multi-Stage Training Approach and Depth Encoding Methodologies", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It is shown that the variable collective-pitch rotors have a significant performance advantage over fixed-pitch rotors when comparing thrust response, and multirotor helicopter step input response performance. Further, it is observed that variable collective-pitch rotors are more efficient in terms of energy consumption than comparable fixed-pitch rotors under similar operating conditions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111359", "output": "Identification of Single Input Single Output Linear Systems using Bayesian Methods with Metropolis Hastings Algorithm", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The method employs a Bayesian approach to compute the posterior distribution of the model parameters given the data-set. Since this distribution is often unavailable in closed form, a Metropolis Hastings algorithm is implemented to draw samples from it. To implement the sampler, the inclusion of prior information regarding the model order of the identified system is discussed. As one of the main contributions of this work, a prior over the Hankel singular values of the model is imposed. Numerical examples illustrate the method.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.34}, {"id": "111360", "output": "\"Online Self-Tuning of Parallelism Degree in PN-TM Systems: A Model-Driven and Localized Search Approach\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This problem has been long investigated for TMs not supporting nesting, but, to the best of our knowledge, has never been studied in the context of PN-TMs. Indeed, the problem complexity is inherently exacerbated in PN-TMs, since these require to identify the optimal parallelism degree not only for top-level transactions but also for nested sub-transactions. The increase of the problem dimensionality raises new challenges (e.g., increase of the search space, and proneness to suffer from local maxima), which are unsatisfactorily addressed by self-tuning solutions conceived for flat nesting TMs. We tackle these challenges by proposing AUTOPN, an on-line self-tuning system that combines model-driven learning techniques with localized search heuristics in order to pursue a twofold goal: i) enhance convergence speed by identifying the most promising region of the search space via model-driven techniques, while ii) increasing robustness against modeling errors, via a final local search phase aimed at refining the model's prediction. We further address the problem of tuning the duration of the monitoring windows used to collect feedback on the system's performance, by introducing novel, domain-specific, mechanisms aimed to strike an optimal trade-off between latency and accuracy of the self-tuning process. We integrated AUTOPN with a state of the art PN-TM (JVSTM) and evaluated it via an extensive experimental study. The results of this study highlight that AUTOPN can achieve gains of up to 45\u00d7 in terms of increased accuracy and 4\u00d7 faster convergence speed, when compared with several on-line optimization techniques (gradient descent, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm), some of which were already successfully used in the context of flat nesting TMs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.73}, {"id": "111361", "output": "Influence Maximization via Network Assortativity: A Factorization-Based Online Learning Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this problem, a learner aims to identify the set of \"best influencers\" in a network by interacting with the network, i.e., repeatedly selecting seed nodes and observing activation feedback in the network. We capitalize on an important property of the influence maximization problem named network assortativity, which is ignored by most existing works in online influence maximization. To realize network assortativity, we factorize the activation probability on the edges into latent factors on the corresponding nodes, including influence factor on the giving nodes and susceptibility factor on the receiving nodes. We propose an upper confidence bound based online learning solution to estimate the latent factors, and therefore the activation probabilities. Considerable regret reduction is achieved by our factorization based online influence maximization algorithm. Extensive empirical evaluations on two real-world networks showed the effectiveness of our proposed solution.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "111362", "output": "Adaptive Direction Information Based DE (aNDi-DE): A Novel Mechanism to Dynamically Balance Exploration and Exploitation in DE Algorithms", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the performance of NDi-DE heavily depends on the selection of direction information. In order to alleviate this problem, two adaptive operator selection (AOS) mechanisms are introduced to adaptively select the most suitable type of direction information for the specific mutation strategy during the evolutionary process. The new method is named as adaptive direction information based NDi-DE (aNDi-DE). In this way, the good balance between exploration and exploitation can be dynamically achieved. To evaluate the effectiveness of aNDi-DE, the proposed method is applied to the well-known DE/rand/1 algorithm. Through the experimental study, we show that aNDi-DE can effectively improve the efficiency and robustness of NDi-DE.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111363", "output": "Evaluation of Fully Homomorphic Cryptography on Cloud Computing: A Study on Parallel Processing Architectures", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The first fully homomorphic cryptosystem was introduced by Gentry in the summer of 2009. In this research, we are interested in evaluating the performance of Gentry's algorithm applied to cloud computing. To conduct the experiments, a cloud was built using Open Stack to provide the virtualized infrastructure for execution. The software architecture was then designed to support parallel processing of Gentry's algorithm on the cloud. The cloud and architecture together provide an environment for experimental instrumentation and study. This paper focuses on the design of an architecture for the study of parallel processing of fully homomorphic algorithms on the cloud.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111364", "output": "ForceBoard: Leveraging Pressure Control for Efficient and Error-Tolerant Text Entry\nForceBoard: Exploring the Potential of Pressure-Based Input for Next-Generation Text Input Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To enter text, users apply pressure to control a multi-letter-wide sliding cursor on a one-dimensional keyboard with alphabetical ordering, and confirm the selection with a quick release. We examined the error model of pressure control for successive and error-tolerant input, which was incorporated into a Bayesian algorithm to infer user input. A user study showed that, after a 10-minute training, the average text entry rate reached 4.2 wpm (Words Per Minute) for character-level input, and 11.0 wpm for word-level input. Users reported that ForceBoard was easy to learn and interesting to use. These results demonstrated the feasibility of applying pressure as the main channel for text entry. We conclude by discussing the limitation, as well as the potential of ForceBoard to support interaction with constraints from form factor, social concern and physical environments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "111365", "output": "\"Directed Graph Rewriting for Dynamic Fault Trees: Simplification Techniques for Scalable Analysis\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Fault Tree Analysis\", \"Reliability Modelling\", \"Directed Graph Rewriting\", \"Fault Tree Simplification\", \"Dynamic Fault Trees\", \"Graph Rewriting for Fault Trees\"]\n\n<features>\n\n</features>\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Their extension with common reliability patterns, such as spare management, functional dependencies, and sequencing--known as dynamic fault trees (DFTs)--has an adverse effect on scalability, prohibiting the analysis of complex, industrial cases. This paper presents a novel, fully automated reduction technique for DFTs. The key idea is to interpret DFTs as directed graphs and exploit graph rewriting to simplify them. We present a collection of rewrite rules, address their correctness, and give a simple heuristic to determine the order of rewriting. Experiments on a large set of benchmarks show substantial DFT simplifications, yielding state space reductions and timing gains of up to two orders of magnitude.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111366", "output": "\"Attributing Cyber-Attacks: A Novel Argumentation-Based Reasoner for Technical and Social Evidence Integration\"\n\nor\n\n\"Attribution of Cyber-Attacks: Combining Technical and Social Evidence for Effective Digital Forensics Analysis\"\n\nor\n\n\"Reasoning Through Cyber-Attacks: A Hybrid Approach to Technical and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Context information plays a crucial role in such dynamically changing environments and the different types of contextual conditions bring new challenges to context-sensitive access control. This information mostly can be derived from the crisp sets. For example, we can utilize a crisp set to derive a patient and nurse are co-located in the general ward of the hospital or not. Some of the context information characterizations cannot be made using crisp sets, however, they are equally important in order to make access control decisions. Towards this end, this article proposes an approach to Context-Aware Access Control using Fuzzy logic (FCAAC) for data and information resources. We introduce a formal context model to represent the fuzzy and other contextual conditions. We also introduce a formal policy model to specify the policies by utilizing these conditions. Using our formal approach, we combine the fuzzy model with an ontology-based approach that captures such contextual conditions and incorporates them into the policies, utilizing the ontology languages and the fuzzy logic-based reasoning. We introduce a unified data ontology and its associated mapping ontology in terms of facilitating access control to cloud-based data resources. We justify the feasibility of our approach by demonstrating the practicality through a prototype implementation, several healthcare case studies and a usability study. Finally, we demonstrate an experimental evaluation in terms of query response time. The experiment results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of our proposed FCAAC approach.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "111368", "output": "\"Efficient Atomic Key-Value Maps for Simultaneous Large Scans and Real-Time Access: A Novel Approach with KiWi\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Their applications simultaneously drive high-rate data ingestion and large-scale analytics. These two scenarios expect KV-map implementations that scale well with both real-time updates and large atomic scans triggered by range queries. We present KiWi, the first atomic KV-map to efficiently support simultaneous large scans and real-time access. The key to achieving this is treating scans as first class citizens,and organizing the data structure around them. KiWi provides wait-free scans, whereas its put operations are lightweight and lock-free. It optimizes memory management jointly with data structure access.We implement KiWi and compare it to state-of-the-art solutions. Compared to other KV-maps providing atomic scans, KiWi performs either long scans or concurrent puts an order of magnitude faster. Its scans are twice as fast as non-atomic ones implemented via iterators in the Java skiplist.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111369", "output": "\"Optimizing Grid-Obstacle Representations for Planar and Bipartite Graphs\"\n\nor \n\n\"Efficient Grid-Obstacle Constructions for Planar and Bipartite Graphs\"\n\nor \n\n\"Grid-Obstacle Representations for Planar and Bipartite Graphs: A Smaller Grid", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It was previously argued that all planar graphs have a grid-obstacle representation in 2D, and all graphs have a grid-obstacle representation in 3D. In this paper, we show that such constructions are possible with significantly smaller grid-size than previously achieved. Then we study the variant where vertices are not blocking, and show that then grid-obstacle representations exist for bipartite graphs. The latter has applications in so-called staircase guarding of orthogonal polygons; using our grid-obstacle representations, we show that staircase guarding is NP-hard in 2D.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111370", "output": "\"Discrete Approximations of Planar Face Complexes: Rasterized Representations with Preserved Topology and Connectivity\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It is defined by the immersion of a planar and connected graph G, which comprises a set of vertices joined by curved edges. G decomposes the plane into faces that need not be manifold or open-regularized and may be bounded by a single loop edge. The PFC may, for example, be used to represent the complex street network of a city, the decomposition of a continent into countries, or the inhomogeneous structure made of a large set of regions of different materials possibly with internal cracks. The rasterized Planar Face Complex (rPFC) proposed here provides a compact representation of an approximation of a PFC, where the precise location of each vertex is quantized to the pixel that contains it and where the precise geometry of each curved edge is approximated by the ordered list (with possible repetitions) of the pixels traversed by (a chosen polygonal approximation of) the edge. We claim three key contributions: (1)\u00a0The geometric error between a PFC and its rPFC is bounded by the pixel half-diagonal. (2)\u00a0In spite of such a drastic discretization of the geometry, the rPFC captures the exact topology of the original PFC (provided that no street lies entirely inside a single pixel) and supports standard graph traversal operators that permit to walk the loop of sidewalks along the streets that bound a face, to cross a street to the opposite sidewalk, or to cross streets in order while walking around their common junction. (3)\u00a0The local connectivity and order information needed to provide the above functionality is stored at each pixel using only about 4 bits per crossing. We discuss the details of this representation, our implementation of its exact construction, four possible embodiments that offer different space/time efficiency compromises, experimental results, relations between rPFC and prior solutions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.54}, {"id": "111371", "output": "Transformative Effects of Context-Aware Synonym Discovery from Free-Text Corpora: A Neural Network Framework for Efficient Knowledge Exploration", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Existing works either require structured annotations, or fail to incorporate context information effectively, which lower the efficiency of information usage. In this paper, we propose a framework for synonym discovery from free-text corpus without structured annotation. As one of the key components in synonym discovery, we introduce a novel neural network model SynonymNet to determine whether or not two given entities are synonym with each other. Instead of using entities features, SynonymNet makes use of multiple pieces of contexts in which the entity is mentioned, and compares the context-level similarity via a bilateral matching schema to determine synonymity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on both generic and domain-specific synonym datasets: Wiki+Freebase, PubMed+UMLS and MedBook+MKG, with up to 4.16% improvement in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and 3.19% in terms of Mean Average Precision (MAP) compare to the best baseline method.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "111372", "output": "Texture Enhancement for Single-Image Super-Resolution: A Novel Approach to Addressing the Remaining Issue of Texture SR", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we present a novel texture enhancement strategy in order to improve the super-resolution performance in the texture region. For texture enhancement, we extract a low-resolution texture layer from an input image and generate a high-resolution texture layer by applying the proposed texture synthesis algorithm. A texture enhanced high-resolution image is then obtained by properly combining the generated high-resolution texture layer with an image obtained by using an existing single-image super-resolution algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed texture enhancement strategy provides sharper and more natural looking textures compared with the existing super-resolution algorithms. This paper addresses a key remaining issue, texture SR, which is yet unresolved.Patch-based texture synthesis is performed by using a LR texture layer.A HR texture patch is synthesized based on both AR and reconstruction models.The proposed algorithm provides realistic SR images with sharp and fine textures.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "111373", "output": "Thermal Compensation of Threshold Voltage in Diode-Connected nMOSFETs using PTAT Current for Low-Power Voltage Reference Circuits in Standard CMOS Technology", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, this comes at a price of increasing computational burden, hence limiting their practical usages. We observe that some corrupted image regions are inherently easier to restore than others since the distortion and content vary within an image. To leverage this, we propose Path-Restore, a multi-path CNN with a pathfinder that can dynamically select an appropriate route for each image region. We train the pathfinder using reinforcement learning with a difficulty-regulated reward. This reward is related to the performance, complexity and \u201cthe difficulty of restoring a region\u201d. A policy mask is further investigated to jointly process all the image regions. We conduct experiments on denoising and mixed restoration tasks. The results show that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to existing approaches with less computational cost. In particular, Path-Restore is effective for real-world denoising, where the noise distribution varies across different regions on a single image. Compared to the state-of-the-art RIDNet [1], our method achieves comparable performance and runs 2.7x faster on the realistic Darmstadt Noise Dataset [2].

Dynamic capacity provisioning is a promising approach for reducing energy consumption by dynamically adjusting the number of active machines to match resource demands. However, despite extensive studies of the problem, existing solutions for dynamic capacity provisioning have not fully considered the heterogeneity of both workload and machine hardware found in production environments. In particular, production data centers often comprise several generations of machines with different capacities, capabilities and energy consumption characteristics. Meanwhile, the workloads running in these data centers typically consist of a wide variety of applications with different priorities, performance objectives and resource requirements. Failure to consider heterogenous characteristics will lead to both sub-optimal energy-savings and long scheduling delays, due to incompatibility between workload requirements and the resources offered by the provisioned machines. To address this limitation, in this paper we present HARMONY, a Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Management System for dynamic capacity provisioning in cloud computing environments. Specifically, we first use the K-means clustering algorithm to divide the workload into distinct task classes with similar characteristics in terms of resource and performance requirements. Then we present a novel technique for dynamically adjusting the number of machines of each type to minimize total energy consumption and performance penalty in terms of scheduling delay. Through simulations using real traces from Google's compute clusters, we found that our approach can improve data center energy efficiency by up to 28% compared to heterogeneity-oblivious solutions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111377", "output": "\"Accelerating Decision-Making in High-Stakes Environments: A Review of Urgent Computing for Critical Situations\"\n\nor\n\n\"Cutting-Edge Computing for Crisis Management: Advances in Urgent Computing for Complex Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"Urgent Computing: Enabling Rapid Response to Complex Technical, Environmental, and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Moreover, they often provide recommendations for scientific publications that might be of interest to researchers. Because of the exponentially increasing volume of publications, effective citation recommendation is of great importance to researchers, as it reduces the time and effort spent on retrieving, understanding, and selecting research papers. In this context, we address the problem of citation recommendation, i.e., the task of recommending citations for a new paper. Current research investigates this task in different settings, including cases where rich user metadata is available (e.g., user profile, publications, citations). This work focus on a setting where the user provides only the abstract of a new paper as input. Our proposed approach is to expand the semantic features of the given abstract using knowledge graphs - and, combine them with other features (e.g., indegree, recency) to fit a learning to rank model. This model is used to generate the citation recommendations. By evaluating on real data, we show that the expanded semantic features lead to improving the quality of the recommendations measured by nDCG@10.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111379", "output": "Neuromorphic Engineering: A Review of Large-Scale Spiking Emulators for Efficient Brain-Inspired Computing\n\nor\n\nNeuromorphic Systems: Designing and Implementing Efficient Devices for Engineering Applications\n\nor\n\nEmerging Neuromorphic Technologies: A Review of Large-Scale Spiking Emulators for Intelligent", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The brain has evolved over billions of years to solve difficult engineering problems by using efficient, parallel, low-power computation. The goal of NE is to design systems capable of brain-like computation. Numerous large-scale neuromorphic projects have emerged recently. This interdisciplinary field was listed among the top 10 technology breakthroughs of 2014 by the MIT Technology Review and among the top 10 emerging technologies of 2015 by the World Economic Forum. NE has two-way goals: one, a scientific goal to understand the computational properties of biological neural systems by using models implemented in integrated circuits (ICs); second, an engineering goal to exploit the known properties of biological systems to design and implement efficient devices for engineering applications. Building hardware neural emulators can be extremely useful for simulating large-scale neural models to explain how intelligent behavior arises in the brain. The principal advantages of neuromorphic emulators are that they are highly energy efficient, parallel and distributed, and require a small silicon area. Thus, compared to conventional CPUs, these neuromorphic emulators are beneficial in many engineering applications such as for the porting of deep learning algorithms for various recognitions tasks. In this review article, we describe some of the most significant neuromorphic spiking emulators, compare the different architectures and approaches used by them, illustrate their advantages and drawbacks, and highlight the capabilities that each can deliver to neural modelers. This article focuses on the discussion of large-scale emulators and is a continuation of a previous review of various neural and synapse circuits (Indiveri et al., 2011). We also explore applications where these emulators have been used and discuss some of their promising future applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.19}, {"id": "111380", "output": "\"Reinforcement Learning for Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification: Efficient Alignment through Exploration Budget Optimization\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As texts always contain a large proportion of task-irrelevant words, accurate alignment between aspects and their sentimental descriptions is the most crucial and challenging step. State-of-the-art approaches are mainly based on word-level attention learned from recurrent neural network variants (e.g., LSTM) or graph neural networks. From another view, these methods essentially weight and aggregate all possible alignments. However, this mechanism heavily relies on large-scale supervision training: without enough labels, it could easily overfit with difficulty in generalization. To address this challenge, we propose SentRL, a reinforcement learning-based framework for aspect-based sentiment classification. In this framework, input texts are transformed into their dependency graphs. Then, an agent is deployed to walk on the graphs, explores paths from target aspect nodes to their potential sentimental regions, and differentiates the effectiveness of different paths. By limiting the agent's exploration budget, our method encourages the agent to skip task-irrelevant information and focus on the most effective paths for alignment purpose. Our method considerably reduces the impact of task-irrelevant words and improves generalization performance. Compared with competitive baseline methods, our approach achieves the highest performance on public benchmark datasets with up to 3.7% improvement.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111381", "output": "\"Unveiling the Dark Web: A Novel Framework for Summarizing Online Extremist Communities through Ideological User Clustering, Narrative Mining, and Radicalization Detection on Social Media Platforms\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As a result, the ability to understand and in some cases mitigate the effects of user communities promoting civil unrest online has become an important area of research. Although methods to detect large online extremist communities have emerged in literature, the ability to summarize community content in meaningful ways remains an open research question. We introduce novel applications of the following methods: ideological user clustering with bipartite spectral graph partitioning, narrative mining with hash tag co-occurrence graph clustering, and identifying radicalization with directed URL sharing networks. In each case we describe how the method can be applied to social media. We subsequently apply them to online Twitter communities interested in the Syrian revolution and ongoing Crimean conflict.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.74}, {"id": "111382", "output": "Hypergraph-based Causality Learning for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation in Complex Networks", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Different from most existing studies which leverage statistical dependencies, we study hypergraphs from the perspective of causality. Specifically, in this paper, we focus on the problem of individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation on hypergraphs, aiming to estimate how much an intervention (e.g., wearing face covering) would causally affect an outcome (e.g., COVID-19 infection) of each individual node. Existing works on ITE estimation either assume that the outcome on one individual should not be influenced by the treatment assignments on other individuals (i.e., no interference), or assume the interference only exists between pairs of connected individuals in an ordinary graph. We argue that these assumptions can be unrealistic on real-world hypergraphs, where higher-order interference can affect the ultimate ITE estimations due to the presence of group interactions. In this work, we investigate high-order interference modeling, and propose a new causality learning framework powered by hypergraph neural networks. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs verify the superiority of our framework over existing baselines.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "111383", "output": "\"Four-Dimensional Facial Expression Recognition via Sparse Features and Conditional Random Fields\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we focus on the problem of 3D dynamic (4D) facial expression recognition. While traditional methods rely on building deformation models on high-resolution 3D meshes, our approach works directly on low-resolution RGB-D sequences; this feature allows us to apply our algorithm to videos retrieved by widespread and standard low-resolution RGB-D sensors, such as Kinect. After preprocessing both RGB and depth image sequences, sparse features are learned from spatio-temporal local cuboids. Conditional Random Fields classifier is then employed for training and classification. The proposed system is fully-automatic and achieves superior results on three low-resolution datasets built from the 4D facial expression recognition dataset - BU-4DFE.

These social interactions of researchers can be well reflected by co-author network, making it feasible to investigate academic community through looking into co-author network, and to study community evolution through dynamic co-author network analysis. Existing metrics measure an author\u2019s impact or centrality in co-author network individually, rather than considering the academic community as a whole. Besides, co-authors of a paper usually make different contributions reflected in the name order, which is often ignored in traditional co-author network analysis. Furthermore, attention has been paid mainly on those structure-level characteristics like the small-world coefficient and the clustering coefficient, the content-level characteristics like community, author, and topics, however, are crucial in the understanding of community evolution. To address those problems, we firstly propose a \u201ccomprehensive impact index\u201d to evaluate the author in a co-author network by comprehensively considering the statistic-based impact and the network-based centrality. Then the comprehensive index value of all authors in a community is added up to evaluate the community as a whole. Further, a lifecycle strategy is proposed for the community evolution analysis. Taking geography academic community as a pilot study, we select 919 co-authored papers from the flagship journal of \u201cAnnals of the Association of American Geographers\u201d. The co-author groups are generated by community detection method. Top three co-author groups are identified through computing with the proposed index and analyzed through the proposed lifecycle strategy from perspective of community structures, member authors, and impacts respectively. The results demonstrate our proposed index and strategy are more efficient for analyzing academic community evolution than traditional methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111386", "output": "\"Verifying the Correctness of the Mobility-Capture CWQ Calculus in Wireless Sensor Networks using Hoare Logic\"\n\nor\n\n\"A Proof System for the mCWQ Calculus: Ensuring the Reliability of Wireless Sensor Networks through Mobility-Aware Verification\"\n\nor\n\n\"Mobility-Aware Communication Quality in Wireless Sensor", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we present a proof system for the mCWQ calculus to prove its correctness. Our specifications and verifications are based on Hoare Logic. In order to describe the timing of observable actions, we extend the assertion language with primitives. And terminating and non-terminating computations both can be described in our proof system. We also give some examples to illustrate the application of our proof system.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111387", "output": "Empowering People through Technology: A Conceptual Framework for HCI Research and Its Implications for Design Approaches", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A Rate-Distortion optimization is applied to obtain the final segmentation choosing nodes of the hierarchy. The consistent segmentation is used to robustly encode depth maps of multiple views obtaining competitive results with HEVC coding standards.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.04}, {"id": "111390", "output": "\"Enhancing Resilience in Supercomputing and Large-Scale Data Centers: A Novel Extension of the Program Vulnerability Factor Metric for Multi-Threaded Applications with Fault Detection Capabilities\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Then we demonstrate how to measure the multi-threaded PVF of an application in simulation and introduce the ability to account for software detection of hardware faults, differentiating faults that cause detected, uncorrected errors (DUE) from faults that cause silent data corruption (SDC).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.73}, {"id": "111391", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generate the title:\n\n\"Topic-Aware Reranking for Hierarchical Image Search: A Novel Framework for Capturing Relevance and Diversity\"\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\"Hierarchical Topic Modeling for Image Search: A Structured Learning Approach to Reranking\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Most of the traditional reranking methods cannot capture both relevance and diversity of the search results at the same time. Or they ignore the hierarchical topic structure of search result. Each topic is treated equally and independently. However, in real applications, images returned for certain queries are naturally in hierarchical organization, rather than simple parallel relation. In this paper, a new reranking method \u201ctopic-aware reranking (TARerank)\u201d is proposed. TARerank describes the hierarchical topic structure of search results in one model, and seamlessly captures both relevance and diversity of the image search results simultaneously. Through a structured learning framework, relevance and diversity are modeled in TARerank by a set of carefully designed features, and then the model is learned from human-labeled training samples. The learned model is expected to predict reranking results with high relevance and diversity for testing queries. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we collect an image search dataset and conduct comparison experiments on it. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TARerank outperforms the existing relevance-based and diversified reranking methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.04}, {"id": "111392", "output": "Influence Maximization in Signed Networks: A Novel Approach to Positive Influence Spreading\n\n<similarpairs>\nInfluence Maximization in Signed Networks: A Novel Algorithm for Positive Influence Spreading\nInfluence Maximization in Signed Networks: An Efficient Method for Maximizing Positive Influence\nInfluence Maximization in Signed Networks: A", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this work, we present an efficient influence maximization method in signed networks. Firstly, we address an independent cascade diffusion model in the signed network (named SNIC) for describing two opposite types of influence spreading in a signed network. We define the independent propagation paths to simulate the influence spreading in SNIC model. Particularly, we also present an algorithm for constructing the set of spreading paths and computing their probabilities. Based on the independent propagation paths, we define an influence spreading function for a seed as well as a seed set, and prove that the spreading function is monotone and submodular. A greedy algorithm is presented to maximize the positive influence spreading in the signed network. We verify our algorithm on the real-world large-scale networks. Experiment results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, particularly can achieve more positive influence spreading.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111393", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\nGiven the similarity in abstract titles from past works:\n- \"Improving Generalization in Neural Networks through Representation-Level Noise Injection\"\n- \"A Sample-Dependent Bound on the Generalization Gap of Neural Networks\"\n\nUsing the features:\n- The abstract", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Encoder models are often determined to optimize performance on training data when the real objective is to generalize well to unseen data. Although there is enough numerical evidence suggesting that noise injection (during training) at the representation level might improve the generalization ability of encoders, an information-theoretic understanding of this principle remains elusive. This paper presents a sample-dependent bound on the generalization gap of the cross-entropy loss that scales with the information complexity (IC) of the representations, meaning the mutual information between inputs and their representations. The IC is empirically investigated for standard multi-layer neural networks with SGD on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets; the behaviour of the gap and the IC appear to be in direct correlation, suggesting that SGD selects encoders to implicitly minimize the IC. We specialize the IC to study the role of Dropout on the generalization capacity of deep encoders which is shown to be directly related to the encoder capacity, being a measure of the distinguishability among samples from their representations. Our results support some recent regularization methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111394", "output": "\"Hardware-Assisted Control Flow Checking: A Low-Overhead Defense Against Code Reuse Attacks\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Attackers can utilize CRAs to hijack the control flow of programs to perform malicious actions without injecting any codes. Many defenses, classed into software-based and hardware-based, have been proposed. However, software-based methods are difficult to be deployed in practical systems due to high performance overhead. Hardware-based methods can reduce performance overhead but may require extending instruction set architectures (ISAs) and modifying the compiler or suffer the vulnerability of key leakage. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a new hardware-assisted control flow checking method to resist CRAs with negligible performance overhead without extending ISAs, modifying the compiler or leaking the encryption/decryption key. The key technique involves two control flow checking mechanisms. The first one is the encrypted Hamming distances matching between the physical unclonable function (PUF) response and the return addresses, which prevents attackers from returning between gadgets so long as the PUF response is secret, thus resisting ROP attacks. The second one is the linear encryption/decryption operation (XOR) between the PUF response and the instructions at target addresses of call and jmp instructions to defeat JOP attacks. Advanced return-based full-function reuse attacks will be prevented with the dynamic key-updating method. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method introduces negligible 0.95% runtime overhead and 0.78% binary size overhead on average.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111395", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Monotone Nonincreasing Bounds for Polynomial Optimization on Simple Sets: Elementary Computation and Strong Convergence Rates\"\n\nUsing the similar abstract-title pairs from my past works: \n[\"Monotone Nonincreasing Bounds for Polynomial Optimization on Simple Sets: A", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The novelty with respect to the converging sequence of upper bounds in Lasserre [Lasserre JB (2010) A new look at nonnegativity on closed sets and polynomial optimization, SIAM J. Optim. 21: 864-885] is that only elementary computations are required. For optimization over the hypercube [0,1](n), we show that the new bounds f(k)(H) have a rate of convergence in O(1/root k). Moreover, we show a stronger convergence rate in O(1/k) for quadratic polynomials and more generally for polynomials having a rational minimizer in the hypercube. In comparison, evaluation of all rational grid points with denominator k produces bounds with a rate of convergence in O(1/k(2)), but at the cost of O(k(n)) function evaluations, while the new bound f(k)(H) needs only O(n(k)) elementary calculations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111396", "output": "\"Effective Trojan-Net Feature Extraction for High-Performance Machine Learning-Based Hardware-Trojan Detection\"\n\nor\n\n\"Optimized Random Forest Classifier for Reliable Hardware-Trojan Detection via Trojan-Net Feature Selection\"\n\nor\n\n\"Feature-Driven Approach for Enhanced Machine Learning-Based Hardware-Trojan Detection\"\n\nor\n\n\"Random", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

How to detect them is a critical concern in IC design process. Machine-learning-based hardware-Trojan detection gives a strong solution to tackle this problem. Hardware-Trojan infected nets (or Trojan nets) in ICs must have particular Trojan-net features, which differ from those of normal nets. In order to classify all the nets in a netlist designed by third-party vendors into Trojan nets and normal ones by machine learning, we have to extract effective Trojan-net features from Trojan nets. In this paper, we first propose 51 Trojan-net features which describe well Trojan nets. After that, we pick up random forest as one of the best candidates for machine learning and optimize it to apply to hardware-Trojan detection. Based on the importance values obtained from the optimized random forest classifier, we extract the best set of 11 Trojan-net features out of the 51 features which can effectively classify the nets into Trojan ones and normal ones, maximizing the F-measures. By using the 11 Trojan-net features extracted, our optimized random forest classifier has achieved at most 100% true positive rate as well as 100% true negative rate in several Trust-HUB benchmarks and obtained the average F-measure of 79.3% and the accuracy of 99.2%, which realize the best values among existing machine-learning-based hardware-Trojan detection methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.17}, {"id": "111397", "output": "Understanding the Interplay between Presence, Attention, and Workload in Immersive Virtual Reality: A Study on Interruptibility", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We conducted a lab study (N=20) with a head mounted display (HMD) to understand the relationship between presence, workload and attention in IVR when measuring three virtual interruption designs. The answer to this question is interesting because prior research has revealed a positive effect on performance when providing intelligent interruptions, for example based on users' level of attention. Our work launches research on interruptibility in IVR by investigating (1) the relationship between attention, presence and workload, and the (2) methods for measuring them in IVR. Our analysis suggests that a trade-off between presence and attention is required when designing interruptions for IVR. Our findings are valuable for researchers and practitioners who want to collect data on attention, presence and workload in IVR to inform interruptibility.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111398", "output": "Based on the provided abstract and features, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Formalizing User Activities in Exploratory Domains: A Top-Down Plan Recognition Approach\"\n\nAlternatively, considering the similar abstract-title pairs and other scholars' styles:\n\n\"Recognizing User Intentions in Dynamic Environments: A Cumulative Plan", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Such settings are prevalent in real world applications such as interaction with open-ended software, collaborative office assistants, and integrated development environments. Despite the prevalence of such settings in the real world, there is scarce work in formalizing the connection between high-level goals and low-level behavior and inferring the former from the latter in these settings. We present a formal grammar for describing users\u2019 activities in such domains. We describe a new top-down plan recognition algorithm called CRADLE (Cumulative Recognition of Activities and Decreasing Load of Explanations) that uses this grammar to recognize agents\u2019 interactions in exploratory domains. We compare the performance of CRADLE with state-of-the-art plan recognition algorithms in several experimental settings consisting of real and simulated data. Our results show that CRADLE was able to output plans exponentially more quickly than the state-of-the-art without compromising its correctness, as determined by domain experts. Our approach can form the basis of future systems that use plan recognition to provide real-time support to users in a growing class of interesting and challenging domains.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111399", "output": "\"Unveiling Novel Clustering Paradigms: A Comparative Analysis of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means, and Network-Based Methods for Categorical and Mixed Data\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Unlike in the discrete setting where a shortcut connects two vertices and the diameter is measured between vertices, we take all points along the edges of the network into account when placing a shortcut and when measuring distances in the augmented network.   We study this network augmentation problem for paths and cycles. For paths, we determine an optimal shortcut in linear time. For cycles, we show that a single shortcut never decreases the continuous diameter and that two shortcuts always suffice to reduce the continuous diameter. Furthermore, we characterize optimal pairs of shortcuts for convex and non-convex cycles. Finally, we develop a linear time algorithm that produces an optimal pair of shortcuts for convex cycles. Apart from the algorithms, our results extend to rectifiable curves.   Our work reveals some of the underlying challenges that must be overcome when addressing the discrete version of this network augmentation problem, where we minimize the discrete diameter of a network with shortcuts that connect only vertices.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111401", "output": "\"Revisiting the Foundations of Reinforcement Learning: Bridging the Gap between Exponential and Hyperbolic Discounting\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The discount factor values future rewards by an exponential scheme that leads to theoretical convergence guarantees of the Bellman equation. However, evidence from psychology, economics and neuroscience suggests that humans and animals instead have hyperbolic time-preferences. In this work we revisit the fundamentals of discounting in RL and bridge this disconnect by implementing an RL agent that acts via hyperbolic discounting. We demonstrate that a simple approach approximates hyperbolic discount functions while still using familiar temporal-difference learning techniques in RL. Additionally, and independent of hyperbolic discounting, we make a surprising discovery that simultaneously learning value functions over multiple time-horizons is an effective auxiliary task which often improves over a strong value-based RL agent, Rainbow.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.69}, {"id": "111402", "output": "\"Model-Based Grasp Planning for Industrial Assembly Tasks: A Superimposed Segmentation Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"High-Precision Grasp Planning for Industrial End-Effectors using Superimposed Segmentation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Stable and Adaptive Grasp Planning for Robotic Assembly using Superimposed Segmentation Techniques\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It focuses on industrial end-effectors like grippers and suction cups, and plans grasp configurations considering CAD models of target objects. The developed algorithms are able to stably plan a large number of high-quality grasps, with high precision and little dependency on the quality of CAD models. The undergoing core technique is superimposed segmentation, which pre-processes a mesh model by peeling it into facets. The algorithms use superimposed segments to locate contact points and parallel facets, and synthesize grasp poses for popular industrial end-effectors. Several tunable parameters were prepared to adapt the algorithms to meet various requirements. The experimental section demonstrates the advantages of the algorithms by analyzing the cost and stability of the algorithms, the precision of the planned grasps, and the tunable parameters with both simulations and real-world experiments. Also, some examples of robotic assembly systems using the proposed algorithms are presented to demonstrate the efficacy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111403", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n  \"Structural connectivity analysis of the cerebral cortex\",\n  \"Connectivity-based cortex parcellation framework\",\n  \"Diffusion MRI-based cortical subunit identification\",\n  \"Validation of cortical connectivity pipelines\",\n  \"Robust", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Connectivity-based cortex parcellation (CCP), a framework to process structural connectivity information gained from diffusion MRI and diffusion tractography, identifies cortical subunits that furnish functional inference. The underlying pipeline of algorithms interprets similarity in structural connectivity as a segregation criterion. Validation of the CCP-pipeline is critical to gain scientific reliability of the algorithmic processing steps from dMRI data to voxel grouping. In this paper we provide a proof of concept based upon a novel model validation principle that characterizes the trade-off between informativeness and robustness to assess the validity of the CCP pipeline, including diffusion tractography and clustering. We ultimately identify a pipeline of algorithms and parameter settings that tolerate more noise and extract more information from the data than their alternatives.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111404", "output": "\"Dynamic Load Optimization in Robotic Systems through Adaptive Gear Ratios\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In order to alleviate this problem, different approaches for RFI detection and mitigation are currently under development. Since RFI signals are man made, they tend to have their power more concentrated in the time-frequency (TF) space as compared to naturally emitted noise. The aim of this paper is to perform an assessment of different TF RFI mitigation techniques in terms of probability of detection, resolution loss (RL), and mitigation performance. In this assessment, six different kinds of RFI signals have been considered: a glitch, a burst of pulses, a wide-band chirp, a narrow-band chirp, a continuous wave, and a wide-band modulation. The results show that the best performance occurs when the transform basis has a similar shape as compared to the RFI signal. For the best case performance, the maximum residual RFI temperature is 14.8 K, and the worst RL is 8.4%. Moreover, the multiresolution Fourier transform technique appears as a good tradeoff solution among all other techniques since it can mitigate all RFI signals under evaluation with a maximum residual RFI temperature of 21 K, and a worst RL of 26.3%. Although the obtained results are still far from an acceptable bias < 1 K for MWR applications, there is still work to do in a combined test using the information gathered simultaneously by all mitigation techniques, which could improve the overall performance of RFI mitigation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111406", "output": "\"Simulating Social Internet of Things-Based Recommendation Systems: A NetLogo Approach to Context-Aware Information Sharing in Smart Vehicle Populations\"\n\nor\n\n\"Modeling Context-Dependent Information Sharing in Smart Vehicle Populations: An Agent-Based Simulation of Social Internet of Things-Based Recommendation Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"NetLogo-Based Simulation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the performance testers often have to go through the hassle of tedious manual operations when interacting with the cloud. A cloud performance evaluation framework is designed for both broad cloud support and good workload extensibility, which provides an automatic interface to monitor the capability and scalability of Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud systems. Cloud API modules are implemented for Amazon EC2 service and OpenStack. It can achieve flexible control workflows for multiple of different workloads and user customization to test scenarios. With several built-in workloads and metric aggregation methods, a series of tests is performed on our private clouds to compare the performance and scalability from multiple aspects. A methodology is also proposed to build a cost-performance model to better understand and analyze the efficiency of different types of cloud systems. Based on the results of the experiments, the model indicates a polynomial relation between performance per instance and the overall cost.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111408", "output": "Systematica 2d: A Formalism for Hierarchical Architecture Design and System Integration\n\nor\n\nFormalizing System Integration: A New Approach with Systematica 2d\n\nor\n\nHierarchical Architectures and System Integration: The Systematica 2d Framework", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

System architectures are a central issue to enable this process. To develop these, hypotheses must be formulated, validated and evolved. We therefore present Systematica 2d, a formalism suitable for both flexible description of hierarchical architecture concepts as well as functional design of the resulting system integration process. We motivate the approach and relate it to other formal descriptions by means of a new formalization measure. It consists of a set of criteria to evaluate how well a formalism supports the expression, construction and reuse of intelligent systems. Systematica 2d is compared with existing formalization languages under this measure and shown to have at least their level of expression. In addition, the system properties of incremental composition, partial testability and global deadlock-free operation are formally defined and proven in the formalism.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.98}, {"id": "111409", "output": "Temperature-Dependent Simultaneous Switching Noise and IR-Drop Analysis in Multilayer Graphene Nanoribbon Power Interconnects for 16 nm ITRS Technology Node", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Such an organization significantly constricts the types of shared structure that can be learned. The necessity of parallel ordering for deep MTL is first tested by comparing it with permuted ordering of shared layers. The results indicate that a flexible ordering can enable more effective sharing, thus motivating the development of a soft ordering approach, which learns how shared layers are applied in different ways for different tasks. Deep MTL with soft ordering outperforms parallel ordering methods across a series of domains. These results suggest that the power of deep MTL comes from learning highly general building blocks that can be assembled to meet the demands of each task.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111411", "output": "\"Probabilistic Part-Based Weighting Aggregation for Image Retrieval: A Simple yet Effective Approach\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Probabilistic Object Proposal Generation for Image Retrieval\", \"Deep Part-Based Aggregation for Image Search\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n{ \"use_of_nouns\": 0.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The proposed PWA utilizes the discriminative filters of deep convolutional layers as part detectors. Moreover, we propose the effective unsupervised strategy to select some part detectors to generate the \"probabilistic proposals\", which highlight certain discriminative parts of objects and suppress the noise of background. The final global PWA representation could then be acquired by aggregating the regional representations weighted by the selected \"probabilistic proposals\" corresponding to various semantic content. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four standard datasets and show that our unsupervised PWA outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised aggregation methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111412", "output": "\"Integrating Cognitive Plausibility and Environmental Robustness in Robotic Spatial Memory Models\"\n\nor \n\n\"Robust Cognitive Architectures for Realistic Environments: Bridging the Gap between Robotics and Biological Cognition\"\n\nor \n\n\"Computational Models of Spatial Memory in Realistic Environments: A Cognitive and Rob", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We utilize planar surfaces such as walls and tables, and static objects such as door signs as features to our semantic mapping approach. Users can interactively annotate these features by having the robot follow him/her, entering the label through a mobile app and performing a pointing gesture toward the landmark of interest. These landmarks can later be used to generate context-aware motions. Our pointing gesture approach can reliably estimate the target object using human joint positions and detect ambiguous gestures with probabilistic modeling. Our person following method attempts to maximize future utility by searching future actions, assuming constant velocity model for the human. We describe a simple method to extract metric goals from a semantic map landmark and present a human aware path planner that considers the personal spaces of people to generate socially-aware paths. Finally, we demonstrate context-awareness for person following in two scenarios: interactive labeling and door passing. We believe as the sensing technology improves and maps with richer semantic information becomes commonplace, it would create new opportunities for intelligent navigation algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "111414", "output": "Characterizing Mobile Friendliness and Aesthetic Appeal of Sponsored Search Ad Landing Pages: A Comprehensive Study of Feature Extraction and Prediction Models", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, next to the experience provided by the sites themselves, advertisements, when clicked, present users with landing pages that are not necessarily mobile friendly. We explore what type of features are able to characterise the mobile friendliness of sponsored search ad landing pages. To have a complete understanding of the mobile ad experience in terms of layout and visual appearance, we also explore the notion of the ad page aesthetic appeal. We design and collect annotations for both dimensions on a large set of ads, and find that mobile friendliness and aesthetics represent different notions. We perform a comprehensive study of the effectiveness of over 120 features on the tasks of friendliness and aesthetics prediction. We find that next to general page size, HTML, and resource usage based features, several features based on the visual composition of landing pages are important to determine mobile friendliness and aesthetics. We demonstrate the additional benefit of these various types of features by comparing against the mobile friendliness guidelines provided by W3C. Finally, we use our models to determine the state of landing page mobile friendliness and aesthetics on a large sample of advertisements of a major internet company.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "111415", "output": "\"Fog Computing and the IoT-Cloud Ecosystem: Overcoming Data Management Challenges in the Era of Growing Edge Computing Needs\"\n\nor \n\n\"Exploring the Potential of IoT-Fog-Cloud Convergence: A Review of Organizational, Management, and Application Aspects\"\n\nor \n\n\"Edge Computing, Fog, and Cloud", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Consequently, the amount of data generated by devices at the edge of the network will also grow. While cloud computing has been an established and effective way of acquiring computation and storage as a service to many applications, it may not be suitable to handle the myriad of data from IoT devices and fulfill largely heterogeneous application requirements. Fog computing has been developed to lie between IoT and the cloud, providing a hierarchy of computing power that can collect, aggregate, and process data from/to IoT devices. Combining fog and cloud may reduce data transfers and communication bottlenecks to the cloud and also contribute to reduced latencies, as fog computing resources exist closer to the edge. This paper examines this IoT-Fog-Cloud ecosystem and provides a literature review from different facets of it: how it can be organized, how management is being addressed, and how applications can benefit from it. Lastly, we present challenging issues yet to be addressed in IoT-Fog-Cloud infrastructures.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111416", "output": "\"Accelerating Network Packet Processing on Intel Xeon Phi: A Low-Latency, High-Throughput Offloading Framework\"\n\nor\n\n\"Optimizing Xeon Phi for High-Performance Network Packet Processing: A Novel Offloading Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Unlocking the Potential of Xeon Phi for Packet Processing:", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Intel Xeon Phi, a relative newcomer in this market, is a distinguishing platform because its x86-compatible vectorized architecture offers additional optimization opportunities. Its software stack exposes low-level communication primitives, enabling fine-grained control and optimization of offloading processes. Nonetheless, our microbenchmarks show that offloading APIs for Xeon Phi comes in short for combining low latency and high throughput for both I/O and computation. In this work, we exploit Xeon Phi's low-level threading mechanisms to design a new offloading framework, Knapp, and evaluate it using simplified IP routing applications. Knapp lays the ground for full exploitation of Xeon Phi as a packet processing framework.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111417", "output": "Biologically Inspired Shunting Short-Term Memory for Robust Monocular Visual Odometry", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

VO refers the process of recovering the relative movements of a camera by analyzing the associated image sequence. While VO is generally formulated as descriptors-based feature tracking with outliers rejection and global optimization, these algorithms are not only computationally expensive but also lack robustness. In the paper, a biologically inspired solution to the monocular visual odometry problem was presented, which was named as shunting short-term memory monocular visual odometry. The proposed method is simple and concise in both concept and implementation. To be more specific, it utilizes the shunting short-term memory to represent the key frames and the latest observations and also to adapt to uncertainties and ambiguities. And scan matching scheme is adopted to search the movement that best explained the difference between the latest observation and the key frame. Because of the dynamic properties of the neural network, the proposed method requires neither explicit extraction of features and descriptors, nor outliers detection and bundle optimization. Theoretical analysis in the paper showed that the proposed method has Lyapunov stability and constant computational complexity. The proposed method was also compared with the classical monocular VO algorithm in real indoor environments, and the experimental results proved that the proposed method outperforms the classical method on both effectiveness and robustness.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111418", "output": "\"AutoPrivacy: A Novel Encryption Scheme for Secure Human Face Recognition on Android Platforms\"\n\nor\n\n\"Concealing Unintended Human Faces with AutoPrivacy: A Temporally and Spatially Aware Encryption Scheme for Android\"\n\nor\n\n\"AutoPrivacy: Enhancing Human Face Recognition Security with Temporal and Spatial Characterization", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In the MobiGuide project, we developed an evidence-based clinical decision-support system that delivered personalized reminders and recommendations to patients, helping to achieve higher therapy compliance. Yet compliance could still be improved and therefore building on the MobiGuide project experience, we designed a new component called the Motivational Patient Assistant (MPA) that is integrated within the MobiGuide architecture to further improve compliance. This component draws from psychological theories to provide behavioral support to improve patient engagement and thereby increasing patients' compliance. Behavior modification interventions are delivered via mobile technology at patients' home environments. Our approach was inspired by the IDEAS (Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share) framework for developing effective digital interventions to change health behavior; it goes beyond this approach by extending the Ideation phase' concepts into concrete backend architectural components and graphical user-interface designs that implement behavioral interventions. We describe in detail our ideation approach and how it was applied to design the user interface of MPA for anticoagulation therapy for the atrial fibrillation patients. We report results of a preliminary evaluation involving patients and care providers that shows the potential usefulness of the MPA for improving compliance to anticoagulation therapy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111421", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Support Detection and Estimation of Sparse Signals\", \"Sparse Signal Recovery from Compressed Measurements\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n[\"Use of \u21131 minimization\", \"Incorporation of soft support detection\",", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Using a double Laplace mixture model as the parametric representation of the signal coefficients, the problem is formulated as a weighted \u21131 minimization. Then, we introduce a new family of iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms based on double Laplace mixture models. They preserve the computational simplicity of classical ones and improve iterative estimation by incorporating soft support detection. In particular, at each iteration, by learning the components that are likely to be nonzero from the current MAP signal estimate, the shrinkage-thresholding step is adaptively tuned and optimized. Unlike other adaptive methods, we are able to prove, under suitable conditions, the convergence of the proposed methods to a local minimum of the weighted \u21131 minimization. Moreover, we also provide an upper bound on the reconstruction error. Finally, we show through numerical experiments that the proposed methods outperform classical shrinkage-thresholding in terms of rate of convergence, accuracy, and of sparsity-undersampling trade-off.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111422", "output": "\"IT Ambidexterity and Organizational Agility: A Mediated Effect of Environmental Dynamism\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We propose that IT ambidexterity enhances organizational agility by facilitating operational ambidexterity, and that the magnitude of facilitation depends on the level of environmental dynamism. We test these relationships utilizing data from a large-scale, matched-pair field survey of business and IT executives. The results confirm that a firm's IT ambidexterity does enhance its organizational agility through the mediated effects of operational ambidexterity, and that the dynamism of a firm's environment affects these relationships.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "111423", "output": "\"Efficient Ranking of Academic Papers via Simplified Relative Citation Ratio\"\n\nor \n\n\"Simplified Relative Citation Ratio for Efficient Academic Paper Ranking\"\n\nor \n\n\"Relative Citation Ratio: A Simplified Approach for Efficient Academic Paper Ranking\"\n\nor \n\n\"Simplified Relative Citation Ratio (S-RCR) for Efficient Ranking of Academic Papers\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Each robot may move on the line in either direction not exceeding its maximal speed. The robots need to find a stationary target placed at an unknown location on the line. The search is completed when both robots arrive at the target point. The target is discovered at the moment when either robot arrives at its position. The robot knowing the placement of the target may communicate it to the other robot. We look for the algorithm with the shortest possible search time (i.e.\u00a0the worst-case time at which both robots meet at the target) measured as a function of the target distance from the origin (i.e.\u00a0the time required to travel directly from the starting point to the target at unit velocity). We consider two standard models of communication between the robots, namely wireless communication and communication by meeting. In the case of communication by meeting, a robot learns about the target while sharing the same location with a robot possessing this knowledge. We propose here an optimal search strategy for two robots including the respective lower bound argument, for the full spectrum of their maximal speeds. This extends the main result of Chrobak et al. (in: Italiano, Margaria-Steffen, Pokorn\u00fd, Quisquater, Wattenhofer (eds) Current trends in theory and practice of computer science, SOFSEM, 2015) referring to the exact complexity of the problem for the case when the speed of the slower robot is at least one third of the faster one. In the wireless communication model, a message sent by one robot is instantly received by the other robot, regardless of their current positions on the line. For this model, we design a strategy which is optimal whenever the faster robot is at most \\(\\sqrt{17}+4\\approx 8.123\\) times faster than the slower one. We also prove that otherwise the wireless communication offers no advantage over communication by meeting.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.18}, {"id": "111426", "output": "\"A Rigorous Extension of the Variational Single-Letter Formula to Non-IID Rotationally Invariant Matrices via Adaptive Interpolation and Random Matrix Theory\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Under a particular probabilistic model, we give an optimal algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that minimizes the expected number of future tosses. The problem is closely related to finding the best arm in the multi-armed bandit problem using adaptive strategies. Our algorithm employs an optimal adaptive strategy -- a strategy that performs the best possible action at each step after observing the outcomes of all previous coin tosses. Consequently, our algorithm is also optimal for any starting history of outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that employs an optimal adaptive strategy under a Bayesian setting for this problem. Our proof of optimality employs tools from the field of Markov games.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "111428", "output": "Robust Tampering Detection via Gamma-Transformed Histogram-Based Feature Extraction and Sliding Window Analysis\n\nor\n\nGamma-Transformed Histogram-Based Feature Extraction for Tampering Detection in Images: A Robust Approach\n\nor\n\nA Novel Method for Tampering Detection in Images using Gamma-Transformed Histogram-Based Feature Vector and Sl", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Voice command usually appears as a popular human---machine interface for communication. Unfortunately, deaf people cannot exchange information from robots through vocal modalities. To interact with deaf people effectively and intuitively, it is desired that robots, especially humanoids, have manual communication skills, such as performing sign languages. Without ad hoc programming to generate a particular sign language motion, we present an imitation system to teach the humanoid robot performing sign languages by directly replicating observed demonstration. The system symbolically encodes the information of human hand---arm motion from low-cost depth sensors as a skeleton motion time-series that serves to generate initial robot movement by means of perception-to-action mapping. To tackle the body correspondence problem, the virtual impedance control approach is adopted to smoothly follow the initial movement, while preventing potential risks due to the difference in the physical properties between the human and the robot, such as joint limit and self-collision. In addition, the integration of the leg-joints stabilizer provides better balance of the whole robot. Finally, our developed humanoid robot, NINO, successfully learned by imitation from human demonstration to introduce itself using Taiwanese Sign Language.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "111430", "output": "Wireless-Based NoC Congestion Mitigation through Triple-Layer CAP-W Platform: A Comparative Study of Congestion Control Strategies\n\n<similarpairs>\nWireless-Based NoC Congestion Mitigation through Triple-Layer CAP-W Platform: A Comparative Analysis of Congestion Reduction Techniques\nWireless-Based NoC Congestion Control", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Inspiring the separation between the communication and the computation demands as well as providing the flexible topology configurations, makes wireless-based NoC a promising future MCSoC architecture. However, congestion occurrence in wireless routers reduces the benefit of high-speed wireless links and significantly increases the network latency. Therefore, in this paper, a congestion-aware platform, named CAP-W, is introduced for wireless-based NoC in order to reduce congestion in the network and especially over wireless routers. The triple-layer platform of CAP-W is composed of mapping, migration, and routing layers. In order to minimize the congestion probability, the mapping layer is responsible for selecting the suitable free core as the first candidate, finding the suitable first task to be mapped onto the selected core, and allocating other tasks with respect to contiguity. Considering dynamic variation of application behaviors, the migration layer modifies the primary task mapping to improve congestion situation. Furthermore, the routing layer balances utilization of wired and wireless networks by separating short-distance and long-distance communications. Experimental results show meaningful gain in congestion control of wireless-based NoC compared to state-of-the-art works.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111431", "output": "\"Revolutionizing Emergency Response: Leveraging the Cloud Paradigm for Resilient Communication Services in Unconventional Environments\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A point cloud consists of a set of coordinates indicating the location of each point, along with one or more attributes such as color associated with each point. Because the size of point cloud data can be quite large, compression is needed to efficiently store or transmit this data. This paper, motivated by techniques currently being used for image and video coding, proposes methods using 3-D block-based prediction and transform coding to compress point cloud attributes. Experimental results using a modified shape-adaptive DCT tailored for use in 3-D point clouds and a benchmark using 3-D graph transforms are shown.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "111433", "output": "\"Vocabulary-Informed Learning for Unified Recognition: Overcoming Challenges in Supervised, Zero-Shot, and Open Set Object Categorization\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Vocabulary-Informed Learning for Zero-Shot Object Categorization\", \"A Unified Framework for Supervised and Unsupervised Object Recognition\"]\n\n<features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Zero-shot learning is one way of addressing these challenges, but it has only been shown to work with limited sized class vocabularies and typically requires separation between supervised and unsupervised classes, allowing former to inform the latter but not vice versa. We propose the notion of vocabulary-informed learning to alleviate the above mentioned challenges and address problems of supervised, zero-shot, generalized zero-shot and open set recognition using a unified framework. Specifically, we propose a weighted maximum margin framework for semantic manifold-based recognition that incorporates distance constraints from (both supervised and unsupervised) vocabulary atoms. Distance constraints ensure that labeled samples are projected closer to their correct prototypes, in the embedding space, than to others. We illustrate that resulting model shows improvements in supervised, zero-shot, generalized zero-shot, and large open set recognition, with up to 310K class vocabulary on Animal with Attributes and ImageNet datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111434", "output": "Stochastic Stability Analysis of Super-Twist Controllers with Discontinuous Dynamics: A Lyapunov Function Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In large systems, components themselves can be complex systems that need to be decomposed into multiple sub-components. Hence, system design must follow a systematic approach, based on a recursive decomposition strategy. This paper proposes a comprehensive verification-driven framework which provides support for designers during development. The framework supports hierarchical decomposition of components into sub-components through formal specification in terms of pre- and post-conditions as well as independent development, reuse and verification of sub-components.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.29}, {"id": "111436", "output": "\"Addressing the Challenges of Sparse Rewards in Online Recommender Systems via State-Aware Experience Replay\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an effective means of capturing users' dynamic interest during interactions with recommender systems. Generally, it is challenging to train a DRL agent in online recommender systems because of the sparse rewards caused by the large action space (e.g., candidate item space) and comparatively fewer user interactions. Leveraging experience replay (ER) has been extensively studied to conquer the issue of sparse rewards. However, they adapt poorly to the complex environment of online recommender systems and are inefficient in learning an optimal strategy from past experience. As a step to filling this gap, we propose a novel state-aware experience replay model, in which the agent selectively discovers the most relevant and salient experiences and is guided to find the optimal policy for online recommendations. In particular, a locality-sensitive hashing method is proposed to selectively retain the most meaningful experience at scale and a prioritized reward-driven strategy is designed to replay more valuable experiences with higher chance. We formally show that the proposed method guarantees the upper and lower bound on experience replay and optimizes the space complexity, as well as empirically demonstrate our model's superiority to several existing experience replay methods over three benchmark simulation platforms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111437", "output": "Record Linkage via Metric Space Indexing: A Parameter-Free Approach Delivering Complete and Efficient Entity Matching", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Records are linked on the basis of similarity between common attributes, with every pair being classified as a link or non-link depending on their similarity. Linkage is usually performed in a three-step process: first, groups of similar candidate records are identified using indexing, then pairs within the same group are compared in more detail, and finally classified. Even state-of-the-art indexing techniques, such as locality sensitive hashing, have potential drawbacks. They may fail to group together some true matching records with high similarity, or they may group records with low similarity, leading to high computational overhead. We propose using metric space indexing (MSI) to perform complete linkage, resulting in a parameter-free process combining indexing, comparison and classification into a single step delivering complete and efficient record linkage. An evaluation on real-world data from several domains shows that linkage using MSI can yield better quality than current indexing techniques, with similar execution cost, without the need for domain knowledge or trial and error to configure the process.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111438", "output": "\"Awareness and Mitigation of Soft Errors in Uncore Components of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) Architectures\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, one of the main obstacles to their adoption lies in obtaining the formal specification of the system, and, in the case of refinement-based formal methods such as B System or Event-B, in obtaining the most abstract specification that heads the development of the system. The SysML/KAOS requirements engineering method is proposed to overcome this difficulty. It includes a goal modeling language to model requirements from stakeholders needs. Translation rules from a goal model to a B System specification have already been defined. They allow to obtain a skeleton of the system specification. To complete it, a language has been defined to express the domain model associated to the goal model. Its translation gives the structural part of the B System specification. However, it very often appears that new elements must be added in the B System specification obtained from SysML/KAOS models, discovered for instance when specifying the body of events and/or by using formal validation and/or verification tools. We have therefore defined a set of rules allowing the back propagation, within domain models, of every newly added element. This paper describes these rules and how they are specified in Event-B. Their consistency is proved using the Rodin tool. We show that they are structure preserving: two related elements within the B System specification remain related within the domain model. This is done by proving various isomorphisms between the B System specification and the domain models.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111440", "output": "\"Provenance-Enriched Intrusion Detection: Leveraging Holistic System Execution Histories to Enhance Attack Vector Agnosticism\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We optimize the four homogeneous coefficients of the equation of a plane, so that the homography it induces on a source image segment minimizes a cost function with photo consistency and edge consistency terms. The photo consistency term for a segment is defined as the summed squared pixel color differences with all target images in which it is visible. For the edges we find a set of sub pixel-precise Canny edge points from the source image. The edge consistency term considers all pairs of segments which are adjacent in 3D, and sums the squared 2D distances of the appropriate Canny edge points to the projection of the line in which the two segment planes intersect. We apply the L-BFGS non-linear optimization algorithm, which uses derivatives of the cost function with respect to the plane equation coefficients, and we derive analytic formulas for these derivatives for both terms in the cost function. An alternate optimization method uses the sparse Hessian matrix of second derivatives, and we compute these second derivatives as well. We test these plane optimizations on both synthetic and real image sequences.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111442", "output": "\"Multi-Modal Sentiment, Emotion, and Sarcasm Analysis for Cyberbullying Detection in Code-Mixed Language Memes\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The current work is the first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, in investigating the role of sentiment, emotion and sarcasm in identifying cyberbullying from multi-modal memes in a code-mixed language setting. As a contribution, we have created a benchmark multi-modal meme dataset called MultiBully annotated with bully, sentiment, emotion and sarcasm labels collected from open-source Twitter and Reddit platforms. Moreover, the severity of the cyberbullying posts is also investigated by adding a harmfulness score to each of the memes. The created dataset consists of two modalities, text and image. Most of the texts in our dataset are in code-mixed form, which captures the seamless transitions between languages for multilingual users. Two different multimodal multitask frameworks (BERT+ResNET-Feedback and CLIP-CentralNet) have been proposed for cyberbullying detection (CD), the three auxiliary tasks being sentiment analysis (SA), emotion recognition (ER) and sarcasm detection (SAR). Experimental results indicate that compared to uni-modal and single-task variants, the proposed frameworks improve the performance of the main task, i.e., CD, by 3.18% and 3.10% in terms of accuracy and F1 score, respectively.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111443", "output": "\"Unlocking the Potential of Interactive Smart Windows: Exploring Design, Development, and User Control for Sustainable and Comfortable Adaptive Buildings\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We provide specific usage contexts and specify interactions that may facilitate domestic applications. Our work illustrates the concept of interactive smart windows and provides insights regarding their design, development, and user controls for adaptive walls.

Building on the techniques of Sample Average Approximation and Genetic Algorithms, we demonstrate that our method can lead up to 24% improvement in costs when demand uncertainties are explicitly considered. We present the results from our preliminary work in the context of a high energy physics application, the Belle II experiments, and believe that the work will equally benefit other scientific workflows executed on distributed resources with demand uncertainties. The proposed method can also be extended to include uncertainties related to resource availability and network performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111445", "output": "Embedding Hypersequent Calculi into 2-Systems: Recovering Locality and Analyticity", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Virtual reality enables us to draw not just on a flat 2D surface, but in 3D space. Our research aims at showing if and how this form of 3D drawing can be beneficial for art education. This paper presents first insights into potential benefits and obstacles when introducing 3D drawing at elementary schools. In an experiment with 18 children, we studied practical aspects, proficiency, and spatial ability development. Our results show improvement in the children's 3D drawing skills but not in their spatial abilities. Their drawing skills also do seem to be correlated with their mental rotation ability, although further research is needed to conclusively confirm this.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111448", "output": "\"Efficient Multi-Sensor Fusion Estimation for Clustered Sensor Networks: A Comparative Analysis of Sequential Methods\"\n\nor\n\n\"Sequential Multi-Sensor Fusion Estimation for Clustered Sensor Networks: A Study on Performance and Computational Complexity\"\n\nor\n\n\"Multi-Sensor Fusion Estimation for Clustered Sensor Networks: A Novel Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Both sequential measurement fusion and state fusion estimation methods are presented. It is shown that the proposed sequential fusion estimation methods achieve the same performance as the batch fusion one, but are more convenient to deal with asynchronous or delayed data since they are able to handle the data that are available sequentially. Moreover, the sequential measurement fusion method has lower computational complexity than the conventional sequential Kalman estimation and the measurement augmentation methods, while the sequential state fusion method is shown to have lower computational complexity than the batch state fusion one. Simulations of a target tracking system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111449", "output": "Stability Analysis of Complex-Valued Hopfield Neural Networks for Associative Memory Patterns", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The framework focuses on solving two main challenges posed by these kinds of documents: 1) data sparseness and 2) synonyms/homonyms. The former leads to the lack of shared words and contexts among documents while the latter are big linguistic obstacles in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). The underlying idea of the framework is that common hidden topics discovered from large external data sets (universal data sets), when included, can make short documents less sparse and more topic-oriented. Furthermore, hidden topics from universal data sets help handle unseen data better. The proposed framework can also be applied for different natural languages and data domains. We carefully evaluated the framework by carrying out two experiments for two important online applications (Web search result classification and matching/ranking for contextual advertising) with large-scale universal data sets and we achieved significant results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111451", "output": "\"Challenges and Solutions in Remote Physiological Signal Measurement from Facial Videos: A Review of the 2nd RePSS Challenge\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The topic draws great interest, but the lack of publicly available benchmark databases and a fair validation platform are hindering its further development. The RePSS Challenge is organized as an annual event for this concern. Here the 2nd RePSS is organized in conjunction with ICCV 2021. The 2nd RePSS contains two competition tracks. Track 1 is to measure interbeat-intervals (IBI) from facial videos, which requires accurate measurement of each individual pulse peak. Track 2 is about respiration measurement from facial videos, as respiration is another important physiological index related to both health and emotional status. One new dataset is built and shared for Track 2. This paper presents an overview of the challenge, including data, protocol, results, and discussion. We highlighted the top-ranked solutions to provide insight for researchers, and we also outline future directions for this topic and this challenge.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111452", "output": "\"Reevaluating the Necessity of Priority Flow Control for RDMA over Converged Ethernet: An Alternative Design Approach\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To achieve good performance, RoCE requires a lossless network which is in turn achieved by enabling Priority Flow Control (PFC) within the network. However, PFC brings with it a host of problems such as head-of-the-line blocking, congestion spreading, and occasional deadlocks. Rather than seek to fix these issues, we instead ask: is PFC fundamentally required to support RDMA over Ethernet?\n\nWe show that the need for PFC is an artifact of current RoCE NIC designs rather than a fundamental requirement. We propose an improved RoCE NIC (IRN) design that makes a few simple changes to the RoCE NIC for better handling of packet losses. We show that IRN (without PFC) outperforms RoCE (with PFC) by 6-83% for typical network scenarios. Thus not only does IRN eliminate the need for PFC, it improves performance in the process! We further show that the changes that IRN introduces can be implemented with modest overheads of about 3-10% to NIC resources. Based on our results, we argue that research and industry should rethink the current trajectory of network support for RDMA.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111453", "output": "\"Augmenting Public VR Experiences: A Proof-of-Concept for ReverseCAVE-based Collaboration\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Therefore, VR games should be attractive for players, as well as for bystanders. Current VR systems are still mostly focused on enhancing the experience of the head-mounted display (HMD) users; thus, bystanders without an HMD cannot enjoy the experience together with the HMD users. We propose the \"ReverseCAVE\": a proof-of-concept prototype for public VR visualization using CAVE-based projection with translucent screens for bystanders toward a shareable VR experience. The screens surround the HMD user and the VR environment is projected onto the screens. This enables the bystanders to see the HMD user and the VR environment simultaneously. We designed and implemented the ReverseCAVE, and evaluated it in terms of the degree of attention, attractiveness, enjoyment, and shareability, assuming that it is used in a public space. Thus, we can make the VR world more accessible and enhance the public VR experience of the bystanders via the ReverseCAVE.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "111454", "output": "\"Mitigating Inflation and Network Congestion through Adaptive Coin Supply Regulation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

On the other hand, the blockchain, or whatever distributed consensus protocol underlying the cryptocurrency, can only process a limited number of transactions in a given time interval. To address both of these two issues, we propose a methodology that connects the coin minting with the prosperity of a cryptocurrency. Specifically, when there are fewer transactions, any cryptocurrency adopting our methodology will introduce a greater inflation to motivate transactions. Moreover, this methodology provides deflations and turns the currency towards a reserve of value when the network burden is too heavy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.34}, {"id": "111455", "output": "Multi-modal Product Summary Generation with Vision-to-Prompt Framework: Overcoming Limitations via Representation-Level Supervision and Robustness Regularization", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although existing methods have achieved great success, they still suffer from three key limitations: 1) overlook the benefit of pre-training, 2) lack the representation-level supervision, and 3) ignore the diversity of the seller-generated data. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a Vision-to-Prompt based multi-modal product summary generation framework, dubbed as V2P, where a Generative Pre-trained Language Model (GPLM) is adopted as the backbone. In particular, to maintain the original text capability of the GPLM and fully utilize the high-level concepts contained in the product image, we design V2P with two key components: vision-based prominent attribute prediction, and attribute prompt-guided summary generation. The first component works on obtaining the vital semantic attributes of the product from its image by the Swin Transformer, while the second component aims to generate the summary based on the product's long text description and the attribute prompts yielded by the first component with a GPLM. Towards comprehensive supervision over the second component, apart from the conventional output-level supervision, we introduce the representation-level regularization. Meanwhile, we design the data augmentation-based robustness regularization to handle the diverse inputs and improve the robustness of the second component. Extensive experiments on a large-scale Chinese dataset verify the superiority of our model over cutting-edge methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111456", "output": "\"Think Like a Sub-Graph (TLASG): Advancing Distributed Graph Processing through Adaptive Repartitioning and Scalability Optimization\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Think Like a Vertex (TLAV): A Novel Approach to Graph-Oriented Programming\"\n\"Graph-Oriented Programming Paradigms: A Comparative Study", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As TLASG-based models allow information to flow freely inside a partition, they usually require much fewer iterations to converge when compared with \"Think Like a Vertex (TLAV)\"-based models.\n\nIn this paper, we further explore the idea of TLASG by enabling users to 1) proactively repartition the graph; and 2) efficiently scale down the problem's size. With these methods, our novel TLASG-based distributed graph processing system ReGraph requires even fewer iterations (typically \u2264 6) to converge, and hence achieves better performance (up to 45.4X) and scalability than existing TLAV and TLASG-based frameworks. Moreover, we show that these optimizations can be enabled without a large change in the programming model. We also implement our novel algorithm on top of Spark directly and compare it with other Spark-based implementation, which shows that our speedup is not bounded to our own platform.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111457", "output": "Based on the provided features, I can generate a title for the abstract.

The transmission rate is adapted to the channel by dynamically assigning bits to the subchannels of the MIMO system. Predictive quantization is used for the feedback of bit loading to take advantage of the time correlation inherited from the temporally correlated channel. Due to the use of decision feedback at the receiver, the bit loading is related to the Cholesky decomposition of the channel Gram matrix. Assuming the channel is modeled by a slowly varying Gauss-Markov process, we show that the nested submatrices generated during the process of Cholesky decomposition can be updated as time evolves. Based on the update, we derive the optimal predictor of the next bit loading for predictive quantization. Furthermore, we derive the statistics of the prediction error, which are then exploited to design the quantizer to achieve a smaller quantization error. Simulations are given to demonstrate that the proposed predictive quantization gives a good approximation of the desired transmission rate with a low feedback rate.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111458", "output": "\"Hybrid Multi-Objective Optimization Approach for Real-World Ship Hull Design: A Feasible Solution for Efficient Navigation in Complex Ocean Environments\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our interest is the definition of a multi-objective deterministic partition-based algorithm. The main target of the proposed algorithm is the solution of a real ship hull optimization problem. To this purpose and in pursuit of an efficient method, we develop an hybrid algorithm by coupling a multi-objective DIRECT-type algorithm with an efficient derivative-free local algorithm. The results obtained on a set of \u201chard\u201d nonlinear constrained multi-objective test problems show viability of the proposed approach. Results on a hull-form optimization of a high-speed catamaran (sailing in head waves in the North Pacific Ocean) are also presented. In order to consider a real ocean environment, stochastic sea state and speed are taken into account. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization aimed at (i) the reduction of the expected value of the mean total resistance in irregular head waves, at variable speed and (ii) the increase of the ship operability, with respect to a set of motion-related constraints. We show that the hybrid method performs well also on this industrial problem.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "111459", "output": "Online Voter Control in Sequential Elections: A PSPACE-Complete Problem", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, elections are often held sequentially and the chair thus knows only the previously cast votes and not the future ones, yet needs to decide instantaneously which control action to take. We introduce a framework that models online voter control in sequential elections. We show that the related problems can be much harder than in the standard (non-online) case: For certain election systems, even with efficient winner problems, online control by deleting, adding, or partitioning voters is $$\\\\mathrm {PSPACE}$$PSPACE-complete, even if there are only two candidates.

People are used to seeking useful information from the relationships among social members to support their decisions on investment, partner seeking and marketing. Corporations are seeking opportunities to leverage them for \u201cword of mouth\u201d advertising based on the relations between the customers. When we collect and observe relationships between people, missing or redundant relations unavoidably occur since the time and cost restrictions in market or social investigation prevent us to discover all the relations. Moreover, since the social relations are changing constantly, current social relations may disappear, and new relations will be established. Many trade and social networks consist of multiple types of relations between the individuals. This paper presents an efficient method to detect the potential and future social relations between individuals in multi-relational social networks using link prediction. First, we calculate the belief of each individual by belief propagation on each type of relations. Based on the belief vectors, the similarities between various types of relations are computed to measure their mutual influence. Based on the similarities between various types of relations, we model link prediction as the problem of matrix completion by optimizing its max-norm constrained formulation. We propose a projected gradient descent optimization algorithm which is scalable to large size networks. Empirical results on real multi-relational social networks demonstrate that the predicting results of our algorithm have higher quality compared with other similar algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111461", "output": "\"Establishing Rigorous Benchmarks for Image Classifier Robustness: A Comparative Analysis of Corruption and Perturbation Resistance\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Unlike recent robustness research, this benchmark evaluates performance on common corruptions and perturbations not worst-case adversarial perturbations. We find that there are negligible changes in relative corruption robustness from AlexNet classifiers to ResNet classifiers. Afterward we discover ways to enhance corruption and perturbation robustness. We even find that a bypassed adversarial defense provides substantial common perturbation robustness. Together our benchmarks may aid future work toward networks that robustly generalize.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111462", "output": "Optimizing Icon Set Selection through Adaptive Siamese Networks: A Novel Similarity Metric for Visual Design", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We train a Siamese Neural Network with an on-line dataset of icons organized in visually coherent collections that are used to adaptively sample training data and optimize the training process.

However, high performance and cost-effective row-buffer cache designs remain challenging for 3D memory systems. In this paper, we propose History-Assisted Adaptive-Granularity Cache (HAAG$) that employs an adaptive caching scheme to support full associativity at various granularities, and an intelligent history-assisted predictor to support a large number of banks in 3D memory systems. By increasing the row-buffer cache hit rate and avoiding unnecessary data caching, HAAG$ significantly reduces memory access latency and dynamic power.

However, each additional sample requires a nearest-neighbor search. Calculating state transition costs can be particularly difficult in cases with complex dynamics such as aerial vehicles in non-isotropic cost fields like wind. Computationally costly nearest neighbor searches increase the time required to add new samples to the search tree, thereby reducing the likelihood of finding low-cost paths in a given computational time. In this paper, we propose the use of a lightweight neural network to approximate nearest neighbor cost calculations. The network approach uses a low-dimensional encoding of the cost space along with a start and goal query pair and returns an estimate of the path cost that can be used for nearest neighbor and path validity estimation. We demonstrate our method for a Dubins airplane model in a 3D wind field and show that the network method achieves equivalent path lengths as an existing iterative solver 32 % faster and, when given the same search time, up to 10.8% shorter.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111468", "output": "\"Optimal Fusion Gains for Unknown Correlations: A Derivation of Covariance Intersection for Two and Three Variables\"\n\nor alternatively \n\n\"Fusing Estimates under Unknown Correlations: A Covariance Intersection Approach\"\n\nor \n\n\"Covariance Intersection: A Bounding Algorithm for Distributed Linear Estimation under Completely Unknown Correlations\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Test case prioritization enables the rapid detection of faults during regression testing by reordering the test suite so that effective tests are run as early as is possible. However, a distinct lack of information about the regression faults found in complex real-world software forced prior experimental studies of these methods to use artificial faults called mutants. Using the Defects4J database of real faults, this paper presents the results of experiments evaluating the effectiveness of four representative test prioritization techniques. Since this paper's results show that prioritization is susceptible to high amounts of variance when only one fault is present, our experiments also control the number of real faults and mutants in the program subject to regression testing. Our overall findings are that, in comparison to mutants, real faults are harder for reordered test suites to quickly detect, suggesting that mutants are not a surrogate for real faults.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.65}, {"id": "111470", "output": "Key Recovery and Security Analysis of the ASASA Construction: Breaking Public-Key Schemes with Efficient Algebraic Attacks", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Its versatility was illustrated by building two public-key encryption schemes, a secret-key scheme, as well as super S-box subcomponents of a white-box scheme. However one of the two public-key cryptosystems was recently broken at Crypto 2015 by Gilbert, Pl\u00fbt and Treger. As our main contribution, we propose a new algebraic key-recovery attack able to break at once the secret-key scheme as well as the remaining public-key scheme, in time complexity $$2^{63}$$ and $$2^{39}$$ respectively the security parameter is 128 bits in both cases. Furthermore, we present a second attack of independent interest on the same public-key scheme, which heuristically reduces its security to solving an $$\\\\mathsf {LPN}$$ instance with tractable parameters. This allows key recovery in time complexity $$2^{56}$$ . Finally, as a side result, we outline a very efficient heuristic attack on the white-box scheme, which breaks an instance claiming 64 bits of security under one minute on a single desktop computer.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "111471", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Temporal Convolutional Networks for Financial Signal Processing\"\n\"Attention Mechanism for Sequence Modeling in Finance\"\n\"Dense Connections for Sparse Convolutional Networks in Financial Time Series\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- Use of", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Traditionally, recurrent networks are often used to model time series, while the latest research shows that convolutional networks, especially temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), are also powerful and effective for a large number of sequence modeling tasks. The temporal convolutional network uses dilation convolution to expand the receptive field, resulting in very sparse connections in high network layers and no connection to neighbor points. Considered that short-term performance often has a more significant influence on the assets price movement, we suggest that TCNs are too sparse for financial signal processing. For a better solution, we propose a novel Attention on Attention Sparse Dense Convolutional Network (AoA-SDCN), which strengthens time decay characteristics by adding dense connections at close points. Moreover, we use the Attention on Attention mechanism to improve the performance further. Experimental results show that these techniques are effective for financial signal processing. The AoA-SDCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Chinese commodity futures and stock datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111472", "output": "Development of a Robotic Manipulator for Enhanced Retinal Cannulation: A Novel Co-Manipulation Control Strategy for Minimally Invasive Surgery", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Retinal cannulation appears to be the most effective treatment, but given the small diameter of a retinal vein, it is too difficult and risky for a surgeon to perform this procedure manually. This work reports on the development of an innovative robotic manipulator to assist vitreoretinal surgeons during this procedure using a co-manipulation control strategy. The robotic manipulator features a new Remote-Center-of-Motion mechanism with four degrees of freedom. This mechanism is particularly interesting for applications in minimally invasive surgery where an instrument needs to be manoeuvred in a highly confined space around a fixed incision point. The developed manipulator is shown to be a great asset in improving the quality of retinal cannulations compared to the manual procedure. This is shown by cannulation experiments performed on a custom made eye model and an injectable retina model that effectively simulate real retinal cannulations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111473", "output": "\"Rethinking Process Models: An Exploratory Study of Storytelling and Sense-Making in Business Process Realities\"\n\n(receiving similar abstract-title pairs: \n[\"Reevaluating Process Models\", \"Beyond Lean Process Modeling\", \"Unconventional Approaches to Business Process Design\"])\n\n(receiving features: \n[\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

How to design efficient, reliable and scalable routing protocols in such wireless heterogeneous sensor networks (WHSNs) with intermittent asymmetric links is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ProHet: a distributed probabilistic routing protocol for WHSNs that utilizes asymmetric links to reach assured delivery rate with low overhead. The ProHet protocol first produces a bidirectional routing abstraction by finding a reverse path for every asymmetric link. Then, it uses a probabilistic strategy to choose forwarding nodes based on historical statistics using local information. Analysis shows that ProHet can achieve assured delivery rate \u03c1 if \u03c1 is set within its upper-bound. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify its efficiency.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.65}, {"id": "111475", "output": "\"Recovering Hidden Clarity: Blind Deconvolution via Sparse Domains for Multi-Blurred Scene Images\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

But there is a significant need for a general, holistic, and quantitative framework of deception. Game theory provides an ideal set of tools to develop such a framework of deception. In particular, game theory captures the strategic and self-interested nature of attackers and defenders in cybersecurity. Additionally, control theory can be used to quantify the physical impact of attack and defense strategies. In this tutorial, we present an overview of game-theoretic models and design mechanisms for deception and counter-deception. The tutorial aims to provide a taxonomy of deception and counter-deception and understand how they can be conceptualized, quantified, and designed or mitigated. This tutorial gives an overview of diverse methodologies from game theory that includes games of incomplete information, dynamic games, mechanism design theory to offer a modern theoretic underpinning of cyberdeception. The tutorial will also discuss open problems and research challenges that the HoTSoS community can address and contribute with an objective to build a multidisciplinary bridge between cybersecurity, economics, game and decision theory.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111479", "output": "Uncertainty-Aware Observer Design for Discrete-Time Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems with Unknown Input Method", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Markov chains are assumed to take values in a countable state space $$\\\\mathbf {S}$$ ; observables $$f: \\\\mathbf {S} \\\\rightarrow {\\\\mathbb {R}}$$ may be unbounded. The interpretation of CTMCs as transformers of observables is via their transition function $$ P_{t} $$ : each observable $$f$$ is mapped to the observable $$ P_{t} f$$ that, in turn, maps each state $$x$$ to the mean value of $$f$$ at time $$t$$ conditioned on being in state $$x$$ at time $$0$$ . The first result is computability of the time evolution of observables, i.e., maps of the form $$t,f\\\\,{\\\\mapsto }\\\\, P_{t} f$$ , under conditions that imply existence of a Banach sequence space of observables on which the transition function $$ P_{t} $$ of a fixed CTMC induces a family of bounded linear operators that vary continuously in time w.r.t. the usual topology on bounded operators. The second result is PTIME-computability of the projections $$t\\\\,{\\\\mapsto }\\\\, P_{t} fx$$ , for each state $$x$$ , provided that the rate matrix of the CTMC $$X_t$$ is locally algebraic on a subspace containing the observable\u00ef\u00be\u017a $$f$$ . The results are flexible enough to accommodate unbounded observables; explicit examples feature the token counts in stochastic Petri nets and sub-string occurrences of stochastic string rewriting systems. The results provide a functional analytic alternative to Monte Carlo simulation as test bed for mean-field approximations, moment closure, and similar techniques that are fast, but lack absolute error guarantees.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.18}, {"id": "111482", "output": "Collaborative Multimedia Tagging: A Comparative Analysis of Unstructured Folksonomy and Structured MPEG-7 Tools in a Web Community Context", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, effort can be greatly reduced and the detail, quality and volume of metadata increased within the context of a web community. Despite this, little empirical research has been carried out to understand how users individually or collaboratively work with multimedia tagging tools, whether structured or unstructured. Consequently, we explore how to effectively achieve collaborative multimedia tagging through the results of an experiment that collected data from 51 users using both unstructured folksonomy (Flickr, YouTube and del.icio.us) and structured MPEG-7 tools (COSMOSIS). We contribute a detailed analysis of the use of the multimedia tagging tools used in the experiment and show the relationships between user behaviours, resultant outcomes of these behaviours, and subsequent implications for future collaborative multimedia MPEG-7 tagging tools.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111483", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n  <similarpairs>\n    Model Design for Low-Rank Structure and Variance Reduction\n    Variance Reduction in Low-Rank Reconstruction Models\n    Low-Rank Reconstruction and Variance Minimization\n    Variance Reduction Techniques", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The role of the Cloud is to allow these resource-limited devices to offload and execute some of their compute-intensive tasks in the Cloud for energy saving and/or faster processing. However, such offloading to the Cloud may result in high network overhead which is not suitable for many mobile/sensor applications that require low latency. So, people have looked at an alternative Cloud design whose resources are located at the edge of the Internet, called Edge Cloud. Although the use of Edge Cloud can mitigate the offloading overhead, the computational power and network bandwidth of Edge Cloud's resources are typically much more limited compared to the centralized Cloud and hence are more sensitive toworkload variation (e.g., due to CPU or I/O contention). In this paper, we propose a locality-aware load sharing technique that allows edge resources to share their workload in order to maintain the low latency requirement of Mobile-Cloud applications. Specifically, we study how to determine which edge nodes should be used to share the workload with and how much of the workload should be shared to each node. Our experiments show that our locality-aware load sharing technique is able to maintain low average end-to-end latency of mobile applications with low latency variation, while achieving good utilization of resources in the presence of a dynamic workload.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111485", "output": "Decidability of Provable Propositions in Inference Systems: A Unified Approach via Automaton Construction and Cut-Elimination\n\nor\n\nDecidability of Provable Propositions in Inference Systems: A General Framework for Automaton-Based and Cut-Elimination Approaches\n\nor\n\nProvability Decidability in", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In order to communicate with and understand the robot, we can leverage interactions, where the human and robot observe each other's behavior. However, it is not always clear how the human and robot should interpret these actions: a given interaction might mean several different things. Within today's state of the art, the robot assigns a single interaction strategy to the human, and learns from or teaches the human according to this fixed strategy. Instead, we here recognize that different users interact in different ways, and so one size does not fit all. Therefore, we argue that the robot should maintain a distribution over the possible human interaction strategies, and then infer how each individual end-user interacts during the task. We formally define learning and teaching when the robot is uncertain about the human's interaction strategy, and derive solutions to both problems using Bayesian inference. In examples and a benchmark simulation, we show that our personalized approach outperforms standard methods that maintain a fixed interaction strategy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111488", "output": "Temporal Analysis of Facial Micro-Expressions: A Fuzzy Histogram of Optical Flow Orientation (FHOFO) Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The recognition of such short-lived subtle expressions is a challenging task. The literature proposes several spatio-temporal features to encode the subtle changes on the face during a micro-expression. The spatial changes are almost indistinguishable as the facial appearance does not change appreciably. However, these changes possess a temporal pattern. This paper explores the temporal features associated with facial micro-movements and proposes fuzzy histogram of optical flow orientation (FHOFO) features for recognition of micro-expressions. The FHOFO constructs suitable angular histograms from optical flow vector orientations using histogram fuzzification to encode the temporal pattern for classifying the micro-expressions. We have also discussed the effect of inclusion and exclusion of the motion magnitudes during FHOFO feature extraction. It has been demonstrated by repeated experiments on the publicly available databases, that the performance of FHOFO is consistent and close or at times even better than the state-of-art techniques.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111489", "output": "\"Automated Goal Revision for Obstacle Analysis: A Learning-Based Approach to Enhance Requirements Completeness\"\n\nor\n\n\"Learning-Driven Goal Revision for Overcoming Obstacles in Domain-Specific Requirements Analysis\"\n\nor\n\n\"Revolutionizing Obstacle Analysis through Automated Goal Revision: A Domain-Consistent Approach\"\n\nor\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These conditions represent risks that can cause severe software failures. The identification and resolution of such risks is therefore a crucial step towards requirements completeness. Obstacle analysis is a goal-driven form of risk analysis that aims at detecting missing conditions that can obstruct goals from being satisfied in a given domain, and resolving them.\n\nThis paper proposes an approach for automatically revising goals that may be under-specified or (partially) wrong to resolve obstructions in a given domain. The approach deploys a learning-based revision methodology in which obstructed goals in a goal model are iteratively revised from traces exemplifying obstruction and non-obstruction occurrences. Our revision methodology computes domain-consistent, obstruction-free revisions that are automatically propagated to other goals in the model in order to preserve the correctness of goal models whilst guaranteeing minimal change to the original model. We present the formal foundations of our learning-based approach, and show that it preserves the properties of our formal framework. We validate it against the benchmarking case study of the London Ambulance Service.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111490", "output": "\"Empowering Visual Analytics in Display Ecologies: A Framework for Multi-Display Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"Visual Analysis in Display Ecologies: Design Considerations for Coordinated Multi-Display Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"Display Ecology for Visual Analysis: A Comprehensive Framework for Information Coordination and Transformation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we claim that their processing naturally leads to formulate the motion invariance principle, which enables the construction of a new theory of learning with convolutional networks. The theory addresses a number of intriguing questions that arise in natural vision, and offers a well-posed computational scheme for the discovery of convolutional filters over the retina. They are driven by differential equations derived from the principle of least cognitive action. Unlike traditional convolutional networks, which need massive supervision, the proposed theory offers a truly new scenario in which feature learning takes place by unsupervised processing of video signals. It is pointed out that an opportune blurring of the video, along the interleaving of segments of null signal, make it possible to conceive a novel learning mechanism that yields the minimum of the cognitive action. Basically, while the theory enables the implementation of novel computer vision systems, it is also provides an intriguing explanation of the solution that evolution has discovered for humans, where it looks like that the video blurring in newborns and the day-night rhythm seem to emerge in a general computational framework, regardless of biology.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "111493", "output": "Characterizing Modern Mobile Malware through Entity-Based Characterization of App Interactions: A Novel Approach for Precise Detection", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Such malware often evade the detection by existing approaches due to their limited expressiveness and accuracy in characterizing and detecting these malware. To address these issues, in this paper, we recognize entities in the environment of an app, the app's interactions with such entities, and the provenance of these interactions, i.e., the intent and ownership of each interaction, as the key to comprehensively characterizing modern mobile apps, and mobile malware in particular. With this insight, we propose a novel approach named EnMobile including a new entity-based characterization of mobile-app behaviors, and corresponding static analyses, to accurately characterize an app's interactions with entities. We implement EnMobile and provide a practical application of EnMobile in a signature-based scheme for detecting mobile malware. We evaluate EnMobile on a set of 6614 apps consisting of malware from Genome and Drebin along with benign apps from Google Play. Our results show that EnMobile detects malware with substantially higher precision and recall than four state-of-the-art approaches, namely Apposcopy, Drebin, MUDFLOW, and AppContext.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111494", "output": "Personalized Digital Instruction for Enhanced Learning Outcomes", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As these agent representatives become immersed in society, it is critical we understand whether and, if so, how they disrupt the traditional patterns of interaction with others. In this paper, we study how programming agents to represent us, shapes our decisions in social settings. Here we show that, when acting through agent representatives, people are considerably less likely to accept unfair offers from others, when compared to direct interaction with others. This result, thus, demonstrates that agent representatives have the potential to promote fairer outcomes. Moreover, we show that this effect can also occur when people are asked to \\\"program\\\" human representatives, thus revealing that the act of programming itself can promote fairer behavior. We argue this happens because programming requires the programmer to deliberate on all possible situations that might arise and, thus, promote consideration of social norms -- such as fairness -- when making their decisions. These results have important theoretical, practical, and ethical implications for designing and the nature of people's decision making when they act through agents that act on our behalf.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111496", "output": "\"Narrative Frameworks for Data Storytelling: Applying Freytag's Pyramid to Enhance Insight Communication\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, a new method is introduced from another point of view. When the noise is an additive spatially and temporally white Gaussian noise, theoretically, it only impacts the diagonal elements of the data covariance matrix. Firstly, the proposed method utilizes the principle of Linear Prediction (LP) to rebuild the denoised diagonal elements of the data covariance matrix. Then, the Orthogonal Propagator Method (OPM) is directly applied for DoA estimation. Compared with the conventional OPM-based methods, the proposed method is more robust to the noise, especially in low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) scenarios.

Web applications regularly undergo maintenance and evolution and their security may be affected by source code changes between releases. To prevent security regression and vulnerabilities, developers have to take re-validation actions before deploying new releases. This may become a significant undertaking, especially when quick and repeated releases are sought. We define protection-impacting changes as those changed statements during evolution that alter privilege protection of some code. We propose an automated method that identifies protection-impacting changes within all changed statements between two versions. The proposed approach compares statically computed security protection models and repository information corresponding to different releases of a system to identify protection-impacting changes. Results of experiments present the occurrence of protection-impacting changes over 210 release pairs of WordPress, a PHP content management web application. First, we show that only 41% of the release pairs present protection-impacting changes. Second, for these affected release pairs, protection-impacting changes can be identified and represent a median of 47.00 lines of code, that is 27.41% of the total changed lines of code. Over all investigated releases in WordPress, protection-impacting changes amounted to 10.89% of changed lines of code. Conversely, an average of about 89% of changed source code have no impact on RBAC security and thus need no re-validation nor investigation. The proposed method reduces the amount of candidate causes of protection changes that developers need to investigate. This information could help developers re-validate application security, identify causes of negative security changes, and perform repairs in a more effective way.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111499", "output": "\"Transitioning Out: Unveiling the Unseen Moments of Virtual Reality Exit\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the momentary experience of exiting VR and transitioning back to the real-world is not well understood. Do users become self-conscious of their actions upon exit? Are users nervous of their surroundings? Using explicitation interviews, we explore the moment of exit from VR across four applications. Analysis of the interviews reveals five components of experience: space, control, sociality, time, and sensory adaptation. Participants described spatial disorientation, for example, regardless of the complexity of the VR scene. Participants also described a window across which they exit VR, for example mentally first and then physically. We present six designs for easing or heightening the exit experience, as described by the participants. Based on these findings, we further discuss the ?moment of exit' as an opportunity for designing engaging and enhanced VR experiences.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "111500", "output": "\"Supporting Multi-Perspective Knowledge Mapping through Integrated Concept Maps\"\n\nor \n\n\"Enabling Collaborative Concept Mapping with Shared and Personal Perspectives\"\n\nor \n\n\"Integrating Individual and Shared Perspectives in Collaborative Concept Mapping\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We then present the results of a formative qualitative evaluation performed on the prototype, where 12 participants, divided into 4 groups, performed a collaborative mapping task with two different versions of the tool: one in which only the shared perspective was available, and another in which the shared perspective was paired with a personal one. From the analysis of the observations gathered in the evaluation, as well as the subjective impressions of the participants collected by means of an electronic questionnaire, we draw requirements for an interaction model supporting multi-perspective concept maps. Such requirements can be summarized as follows: (1) the UI should overlay the personal and the shared perspective, to stress that they concern the same object (the map) and to enable comparison; (2) \"shared\" and \"personal\" should be supported by different work modalities, which should be explicitly enabled in the UI; (3) the UI should include a \"revision of changes\" mode to support users in evaluating changes by others, and relating their perspective to the work of others.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.84}, {"id": "111501", "output": "\"Multisensor State-Space Modeling and Parameter Estimation for Scalable Network Self-Calibration\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In our proposed approach, it is assumed that the decision maker has fuzzy goals for not only original objective functions but also the corresponding distribution functions in a probability maximization model, and such fuzzy goals are quantified by eliciting the corresponding membership functions. Using the fuzzy decision, such two kinds of membership functions are integrated. The satisfactory solution is derived from among an extended Pareto optimal solution set through the interaction with the decision maker. An illustrative numerical example is provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111503", "output": "Mining Collocated Collaboration Data: Principles and Dilemmas for Supporting Effective Collaboration in Physical Spaces", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, in physical spaces it is not always easy to provide teams with evidence to support collaboration. Emerging technology provides a promising opportunity to make collocated collaboration visible by harnessing data about interactions and then mining and visualizing it. These collocated collaboration analytics can help researchers, designers, and users to understand the complexity of collaboration and to find ways they can support collaboration. This article introduces and motivates a set of principles for mining collocated collaboration data and draws attention to trade-offs that may need to be negotiated en route. We integrate Data Science principles and techniques with the advances in interactive surface devices and sensing technologies. We draw on a 7-year research program that has involved the analysis of six group situations in collocated settings with more than 500 users and a variety of surface technologies, tasks, grouping structures, and domains. The contribution of the article includes the key insights and themes that we have identified and summarized in a set of principles and dilemmas that can inform design of future collocated collaboration analytics innovations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "111504", "output": "\"Unifying Data Frameworks for Big Data Analytics: An Algorithmic Solution for Header-Indexed Tables\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Unifying Data Frameworks for Big Data Analytics\", \"End-to-End Table Processing for Human-Readable Tables\"]\n[\"Algorithmic Solution for Header-Indexed Tables\", \"Transforming Tables for", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For a meaningful role in Big Data analytics, the facts reported in these tables must be brought into a uniform framework. Based on a formalization of header-indexed tables, we proffer an algorithmic solution to end-to-end table processing for a large class of human-readable tables. The proposed algorithms transform header-indexed tables to a category table format that maps easily to a variety of industry-standard data stores for query processing. The algorithms segment table regions based on the unique indexing of the data region by header paths, classify table cells, and factor header category structures of two-dimensional as well as the less common multidimensional tables. Experimental evaluations substantiate the algorithmic approach to processing heterogeneous tables. As demonstrable results, the algorithms generate queryable relational database tables and semantic-web triple stores. Application of our algorithms to 400 web tables randomly selected from diverse sources shows that the algorithmic solution automates end-to-end table processing.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111505", "output": "Optimization of Atomic Norms in Line Spectral Estimation: A Semidefinite Approach to Upper-Bounding Finite Impulse Response Filters", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As business needs change over time, IT applications are expected to continue providing required support. Whether the existing IT applications are still fit for the business purpose they were intended or new IT applications should be introduced is a strategic decision for business, IT and business-aligned IT. In this article, we present a method that aims to analyse business functions and IT roles and to evaluate business-aligned IT from both social and technical perspectives. The method introduces a set of techniques that systematically supports the evaluation of the existing IT applications in relation to their technical capabilities for maximising business value. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation process and results that are illustrated and validated through a real-life case study of a UK borough council and followed by discussion on implications for researchers and practitioners.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111508", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Modeling Shadowing Variations in Wireless Channels\"\n\"Finite-State Markovian Model for Shadowing Effects\"\n\"Channel Modeling for Wireless Networks with Shadowing\"\n\"Shadowing Effects in Wireless Communications: A Modeling Approach\"\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In contrast to prior work, which has focused primarily on channel modeling on a short, per- packet timescale (millisecond), we develop and validate a finite-state Markovian model that captures variations due to shadowing, which occur at coarser time scales. The Markov chain is constructed by partitioning the entire range of shadowing into a finite number of intervals. We determine the Markov chain transition matrix in two ways: (i) via an abstract modeling approach in which shadowing effects are modeled as a log-normally distributed random process affecting the received power, and the transition probabilities are derived as functions of the variance and autocorrelation function of shadowing; (ii) via an empirical approach, in which the transition matrix is calculated by directly measuring the changes in signal strengths. We test the assumptions of our Markovian model using signal strength measurements collected over an 802.16e (WiMAX) network and a wireless multi-hop network deployed by Rice University. We compare the steady state and transient performance of the model with those computed using the empirically derived transition matrix and those observed in the actual traces themselves.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111509", "output": "Temporal Modulation and Non-Orthogonal Waveform Interference Mitigation in Multi-Carrier Transmission Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Vision-based technologies are widely installed in real-time occupancy monitoring systems due to accuracy and reliability. However, monitoring occupancy through unprotected video may disclose privacy of innocent people. Therefore, protecting confidentiality and accurately counting the number of people in real-time scenarios is a severe challenge. Encrypting such videos is one of the promising solutions for maintaining privacy. In this paper, we propose a real-time occupancy monitoring system with Region of Interest (ROI) based light-weight video encryption. People movement is detected through a widely used background model, i.e., Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Kalman filter. Instead of encrypting the whole frame including background, the main idea is to encrypt people present in video via Tangent Delay Ellipse Reflecting Cavity Map System (TD-ERCS). Compared to existing schemes which are mainly based on complete encryption, the proposed method provides partial encryption though cryptographically secure and low-cost computation. The proposed scheme is tested with several different parameters such as correlation, entropy, contrast, energy, Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR) NPCR, Unified Average Change Intensity (UACI) and key space. Results from all security parameters have highlighted sufficient security of the proposed scheme.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111511", "output": "Based on the provided features, I'll generate a title for the abstract.

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive number: if the number is even, divide it by two, and if the number is odd, triple it and add one. The Collatz conjecture asserts that, starting from any positive number m, repeated iteration of the operations eventually produces the value 1. We have implemented it on NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN~X and evaluated the performance. The experimental results show that, our GPU implementation can verify 1.31x10^12 64-bit numbers per second. While the sequential CPU implementation on Intel Core i7-4790 can verify 5.25x10^9 64-bit numbers per second. Thus, our implementation on the GPU attains a speed-up factor of 249 over the sequential CPU implementation. Additionally, we accelerated the computation of counting the number of the above operations until a number reaches 1, called delay that is one of the mathematical interests for the Collatz conjecture by the GPU. Using a similar idea, we achieved a speed-up factor of 73.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.07}, {"id": "111512", "output": "Improving Machine Translation Quality through Word-Level Quality Prediction and Re-ranking: A Comparative Study of N-best List and Search Graph Re-decoding", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this manner, the word scores estimated by word confidence estimation systems help to reconsider the MT hypotheses for selecting a better candidate rather than accepting the current sub-optimal one. In the first attempt, the selection scope is limited to the MT N-best list, in which our proposed re-ranking features are combined with those of the decoder for re-scoring. Then, the search space is enlarged over the entire search graph, storing many more hypotheses generated during the first pass of decoding. Over all paths containing words of the N-best list, we propose an algorithm to strengthen or weaken them depending on the estimated word quality. In both methods, the highest score candidate after the search becomes the official translation. The results obtained show that both approaches advance the MT quality over the one-pass baseline, and the search graph re-decoding achieves more gains (in BLEU score) than N-best List Re-ranking method.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111513", "output": "\"Software-Intensive Systems Development: A Comparative Analysis of Undergraduate Capabilities in Science and Engineering Programs\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Machine-monitoring data allows measuring manufacturing equipment efficiency. However, acquiring real and useful machine-monitoring data is expensive and time consuming. An alternative method of getting data is to generate machine-monitoring data using simulation. The simulation data mimic operations and operational failure. In addition, the data can also be used to fill in real data sets with missing values from real-time data collection. The mimicking of real manufacturing systems in computer-based systems is called \"virtual manufacturing\". The computer-based systems execute the manufacturing system models that represent real manufacturing systems. In this paper, we introduce a virtual machining model of milling operations. We developed a prototype virtual machining model that represents 3-axis milling operations. This model is a digital mock-up of a real milling machine; it can generate machine-monitoring data from a process plan. The prototype model provides energy consumption data based on physics-based equations. The model uses the standard interfaces of Step-compliant data interface for Numeric Controls (STEP-NC) and MTConnect to represent process plan and machine-monitoring data, respectively. With machine-monitoring data for a given process plan, manufacturing engineers can anticipate the impact of a modification in their actual manufacturing systems. This paper describes also how the virtual machining model is integrated into an agent-based model in a simulation environment. While facilitating the use of the virtual machining model, the agent-based model also contributes to the generation of more complex manufacturing system models, such as a virtual shop-floor model. The paper describes initial building steps towards a shop-floor model. Aggregating the data generated during the execution of a virtual shop-floor model allows one to take advantage of data analytics techniques to predict performance at the shop-floor level.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.18}, {"id": "111516", "output": "\"Self-levitating Programmable Matter Platforms for 2.5D Voxel Grid Representation and Interactive Deformations\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

GridDrones consists of cube-shaped nanocopters that can be placed in a volumetric 1xnxn mid-air grid, which is demonstrated here with 15 voxels. The number of voxels and scale is only limited by the size of the room and budget. Grid deformations can be applied interactively to this voxel lattice by manually selecting a set of voxels, then assigning a continuous topological relationship between voxel sets that determines how voxels move in relation to each other and manually drawing out selected voxels from the lattice structure. Using this simple technique, it is possible to create unsupported structures that can be translated and oriented freely in 3D. Shape transformations can also be recorded to allow for simple physical shape morphing animations. This work extends previous work on selection and editing techniques for 3D user interfaces.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111517", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\nOptimal Wireless Network Configuration for Control Systems\nAdaptive Network Reconfiguration for Real-Time Control Systems\nWireless Network Optimization for Cyber-Physical Systems\nReal-Time Wireless Network Reconfiguration for Control Systems\nOnline Network Reconfiguration for", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, interference and noise can cause delays and packet losses that can degrade control system performance, which leads us to find the optimal network configuration to minimize that impact. Another problem of wireless networks for control systems is caused by time-varying fault patterns, which motivates us to do network reconfiguration at runtime. We focus on the online wireless network reconfiguration in an embedded networked and cyber-physical system (CPS), with four main contributions: (1) the design and implementation of a novel network reconfiguration framework with offline and online components that consider time-correlated link failures; (2) a network imperfection model; (3) six online reconfiguration algorithms for wireless control system; (4) a case study with 12 hops and up to 50 nodes that controls a nonlinear small modular nuclear reactor. Our network imperfection model is accurate (with 0.993 Pearson correlation) and our online reconfiguration algorithms have smaller error and longer network lifetime than a state-of-the-art static scheme.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111518", "output": "\"Linking Software Measurement Goals to Organizational Success: A GQM+Strategies(R) Approach\"\n\nor alternatively:\n\n\"Translating Business Strategy into Operational Software Goals: Enhancing GQM with Strategic Alignment\"\n\nor also:\n\n\"From Software to Business: A GQM+Strategies(R) Framework for Quantitative", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach has proven itself useful in a variety of industrial settings to support quantitative software project management. However, it does not address linking software measurement goals to higher-level goals of the organization in which the software is being developed. This linkage is important, as it helps to justify software measurement efforts and allows measurement data to contribute to higher-level decisions. In this paper, we propose a GQM+Strategies(R) measurement approach that builds on the GQM approach to plan and implement software measurement. GQM+Strategies(R) provides mechanisms for explicitly linking software measurement goals to higher-level goals for the software organization, and further to goals and strategies at the level of the entire business. The proposed method is illustrated in the context of an example application of the method.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111519", "output": "\"Unveiling Performance Modeling Paradigms: A Framework for Interdisciplinary Research in Information Retrieval, NLP, and Recommender Systems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Objective  We sought to assess how far the findings of systematic reviews addressing practice-oriented topics have been derived from empirical studies that were performed in industry or that used industry data.    Method  We drew upon and augmented the data obtained from a tertiary study that performed a systematic review of systematic reviews published in the period up to the end of 2015, seeking to identify those with findings that are relevant for teaching and practice. For the supplementary analysis reported here, we then examined the profiles of the primary studies as reported in each systematic review.    Results  We identified 48 systematic reviews as candidates for further analysis. The many differences that arise between systematic reviews, together with the incompleteness of reporting for these, mean that our counts should be treated as indicative rather than definitive. However, even when allowing for problems of classification, the findings from the majority of these systematic reviews were predominantly derived from using primary studies conducted in industry. There was also an emphasis upon the use of case studies, and a number of the systematic reviews also made some use of weaker \u2018experience\u2019 or even \u2018opinion\u2019 papers.    Conclusions  Primary studies from industry play an important role as inputs to systematic reviews. Using more rigorous industry-based primary studies can give greater authority to the findings of the systematic reviews, and should help with the creation of a corpus of sound empirical data to support evidence-informed decisions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "111521", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Emerging Non-Volatile Memories\", \"High-Density Storage\"]\n[\"Magnetoelectric Memory\", \"Low-Power Operation\"]\n[\"Random Access Memory\", \"Antiferromagnetic Dynamics\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, circuit models and performance benchmarking for the domain wall (DW) reversal-based magnetoelectric-antiferromagnetic random access memory (ME-AFMRAM) at cell-level and at array-level. We also provide perspectives for coherent rotation-based memory switching with topological insulator-driven anomalous Hall read-out. In the coherent rotation regime, the ultra-low power magnetoelectric switching coupled with the terahertz-range antiferromagnetic dynamics result in substantially lower energy-per-bit and latency metrics for the ME-AFM RAM compared to other NVMs including STT-MRAM and PCM. After characterizing the novel ME-AFM RAM, we leverage its unique properties to build a dense, on-chip, secure NVM platform, called SMART: A Secure Magnetoelectric Antiferromagnet-Based Tamper-Proof Non-Volatile Memory. New NVM technologies open up challenges and opportunities from a data-security perspective. For example, their sensitivity to magnetic fields and temperature fluctuations, and their data remanence after power-down make NVMs vulnerable to data theft and tampering attacks. The proposed SMART memory is not only resilient against data confidentiality attacks seeking to leak sensitive information but also ensures data integrity and prevents Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the memory. It is impervious to particular power side-channel (PSC) attacks that exploit asymmetric read/write signatures for '0' and '1' logic levels, and photonic side-channel attacks that monitor photo-emission signatures from the chip backside.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.18}, {"id": "111522", "output": "Personalized Serious Games for Chronic Disease Management: A Lifestyle Intervention Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although the suitability of GPU is well-known for computer graphics and image processing applications which require massively parallel floating-point computations, recent research movement towards general purpose computing on-GPU (GPGPU) makes it possible to take advantage of parallel processors to accelerate text processing applications as well. However, how to fully leverage different types of parallel processor architectures to obtain optimal performance (especially with text) without making specific efforts to each platform still remains a great challenge. We applied performance and accuracy enhancements to Naive Bayes algorithm to develop a practically sound implementation of text classification. A platform-aware dynamic configuration support automation flow is also proposed to support the seamless execution of our work across platforms. Experiments on various (integrated graphics, dedicated multiple GPUs) platforms demonstrate that our proposed approach improves both accuracy and performance of text classification.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111524", "output": "\"Evaluating the Efficacy of Supervisory Control Strategies in Managing SEIADR Epidemic Models: A Comparative Study of Multi-Objective Optimization Approaches\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The problem thus is sharply different from the more traditional items-to-users recommendation, since a good match requires meeting the preferences of both users. We initiate a rigorous theoretical investigation of the reciprocal recommendation task in a specific framework of sequential learning. We point out general limitations, formulate reasonable assumptions enabling effective learning and, under these assumptions, we design and analyze a computationally efficient algorithm that uncovers mutual likes at a pace comparable to those achieved by a clearvoyant algorithm knowing all user preferences in advance. Finally, we validate our algorithm against synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved empirical performance over simple baselines.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111526", "output": "\"Nonuniform State Space Reconstruction for Multivariate Chaotic Systems: A Novel Criterion-Based Approach\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Nonuniform State Space Reconstruction for Chaotic Systems\", \"A Novel Criterion-Based Approach for Multivariate Chaotic Time Series\"]\n\n<features>\n\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Selection of reconstructed variables is essential to the analysis and prediction of multivariate chaotic time series. As most existing state space reconstruction theorems deal with univariate time series, we have presented a novel nonuniform state space reconstruction method using information criterion for multivariate chaotic time series. We derived a new criterion based on low dimensional approximation of joint mutual information for time delay selection, which can be solved efficiently through the use of an intelligent optimization algorithm with low computation complexity. The embedding dimension is determined by conditional entropy, after which the reconstructed variables have relatively strong independence and low redundancy. The scheme, which integrates nonuniform embedding and feature selection, results in better reconstructions for multivariate chaotic systems. Moreover, the proposed nonuniform state space reconstruction method shows good performance in forecasting benchmark and actual multivariate chaotic time series.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.01}, {"id": "111527", "output": "\"Improving Face Recognition Accuracy under Varying Illumination Conditions via Adaptive Discrete Wavelet Transform with Quality-Based Normalization and Fuzzy Fusion\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Various quality factors, such as different lighting conditions, occlusion, and variations in pose and expression may affect an automated face recognition system. One of the most challenging issues in automated face recognition is intra-class variations introduced by the varied facial quality due to the variation in illumination conditions. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based face recognition approach which will normalize the illumination distortion using quality-based normalization approaches. The DWT based approach is used to extract the low and high frequency sub-bands for representing the facial features. In the proposed method, a weighted fusion of the low and high frequency sub-bands is computed to improve the identification accuracy under varying lighting conditions. The selection of fusion parameters is made using fuzzy membership functions. The performance of the proposed method was validated on the Extended Yale Database B. Experimental result shows that the proposed method outperforms some well-known face recognition approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "111528", "output": "Embedded Linear Transformations for Sparse Incompletely Defined Discrete Functions", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We assume the function to be sparse i.e. |S| is 'small' relative to the cardinality of the domain. We show that by embedding the domain {0,1,,q -- 1}n, where n is the number of variables and q is a prime power, in a suitable ring structure, the multiplicative structure of the ring can be used to construct a linear function {0,1,,q -- 1}n\u2192{0,1,,q -- 1}m that is injective on S provided that m > 2logq|S|+logq(n -- 1). In this way we find a linear transform that reduces the number of variables from n to m, and can be used e.g. in implementation of an incompletely defined discrete function by using linear decomposition.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.31}, {"id": "111529", "output": "\"Online Topology Inference via Graph Shift Operator: A Streaming Approach to Diffusion Dynamics\"\n\nor\n\n\"Efficient Topology Estimation from Streaming Diffusion Signals: A Sparse Graph Shift Operator Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Recovering Large Scale Graphs from Streaming Nodal Observations via Graph Shift Operator and Alternating Direction", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To that end, we leverage the stationarity of the signals and use the so-called graph-shift operator (GSO) as a matrix representation of the graph. Under this model, estimated covariance eigenvectors obtained from streaming independent graph signals diffused on the sought network are a valid estimator of the GSO's spectral templates. We develop an ADMM algorithm to find a sparse and structurally admissible GSO given the eigenvectors estimate. Then, we propose an online scheme that upon sensing new diffused observations, efficiently updates eigenvectors (thus makes more accurate on expectation) and performs only one or a few iterations of the mentioned ADMM until the new data is observed. Numerical tests illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed topology inference approach in recovering large scale graphs, adapting to streaming information, and accommodating changes in the sought network.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111530", "output": "Top-k Frequent Spatiotemporal Terms (kFST) Queries: An Efficient Index Structure and Algorithm for Geotagged Data", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper we study a basic analytics query on geotagged data, namely: given a spatiotemporal region, find the most frequent terms among the social posts in that region. While there has been prior work on keyword search on spatial data (find the objects nearest to the query point that contain the query keywords), and on group keyword search on spatial data (retrieving groups of objects), our problem is different in that it returns keywords and aggregated frequencies as output, instead of having the keyword as input. Moreover, we differ from works addressing the streamed version of this query in that we operate on large, disk resident data and we provide exact answers. We propose an index structure and algorithms to efficiently answer such top-k spatiotemporal range queries, which we refer as Top-k Frequent Spatiotemporal Terms (kFST) queries. Our index structure employs an R-tree augmented by top-k sorted term lists (STLs), where a key challenge is to balance the size of the index to achieve faster execution and smaller space requirements. We theoretically study and experimentally validate the ideal length of the stored term lists, and perform detailed experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods compared to baselines on real datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111531", "output": "Automated Evolution of Convolutional Neural Networks: A Genetic Algorithm Approach to CNN Architecture Design", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In order to design a CNN with promising performance, extensive expertise in both CNNs and the investigated problem domain is required, which is not necessarily available to every interested user. To address this problem, we propose to automatically evolve CNN architectures by using a genetic algorithm (GA) based on ResNet and DenseNet blocks. The proposed algorithm is completely automatic in designing CNN architectures. In particular, neither preprocessing before it starts nor postprocessing in terms of CNNs is needed. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm does not require users with domain knowledge on CNNs, the investigated problem, or even GAs. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmark data sets against 18 state-of-the-art peer competitors. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CNNs hand-crafted and the CNNs designed by automatic peer competitors in terms of the classification performance and achieves a competitive classification accuracy against semiautomatic peer competitors. In addition, the proposed algorithm consumes much less computational resource than most peer competitors in finding the best CNN architectures.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "111532", "output": "\"Reevaluating Rumor Spreading in Distributed Algorithms: A Buffer-Accommodating Framework for Push and Pull Paradigms\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The two most popular communication paradigms used for spreading the rumor are Push and Pull algorithms. The former protocol allows nodes to send the rumor to a randomly selected neighbor at each step, while the latter is based on sending a request and downloading the rumor from a randomly selected neighbor, provided the neighbor has it. Previous analysis of these protocols assumed that every node could process all such push/pull operations within a single step, which could be unrealistic in practical situations. Therefore we propose a new framework for analysis rumor spreading accommodating buffers, in which a node can process only one push/pull message or push request at a time. We develop upper and lower bounds for randomized rumor spreading time in the new framework, and compare the results with analogous in the old framework without buffers.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.74}, {"id": "111533", "output": "Revisiting and Refining Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Images: A Recursive Approach Based on MSB and LSB Substitution", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In current state-of-the-art methods, most of them use least significant bit (LSB) substitution or prediction, but fail to embed a significant amount of information. Recently, a new class of RDHEI method, based on most significant bit (MSB) substitution, has emerged. By exploiting the natural correlation between pixels in the clear domain, it is possible to have a payload close to 1 bpp with a very high image quality, without adding overhead. In particular, in the approach based on embedded prediction errors (EPE-based approach) [6], the authors propose to embed the prediction error location information in the encrypted MSB-plane. In this paper, we present a huge-capacity RDHEI (HCRDHEI) method. In fact, we are interested in improving the proposed EPE-based RDHEI approach by using recursively other bit-planes, from MSB to LSB as long as it is possible. Indeed, depending on the image content, bit-planes can easily be predicted, and so most of them can be substituted by bits of a secret message. According to the obtained results, the payload can be much higher than 1 bpp (median equal to 1.749 bpp, on average 1.836 bpp, and 5.408 bpp in the best case), while preserving perfect reversibility.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111534", "output": "Time-Aware Recurrent Neural Network Model for Predictive Analysis of User Behavior and Digital Marketing Applications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, exploiting such data in real-world applications is still difficult for service providers due to the complexities of user behavior over a sheer number of possible actions that can vary according to time. In this work, a time-aware RNN model, TRNN, is proposed for predictive analysis from user behavior data. First, our approach predicts next user action more accurately than the baselines including the n-gram models as well as two recently introduced time-aware RNN approaches. Second, we use TRNN to learn user embeddings from sequences of user actions and show that overall the TRNN embeddings outperform conventional RNN embeddings. Similar to how word embeddings benefit a wide range of task in natural language processing, the learned user embeddings are general and could be used in a variety of tasks in the digital marketing area. This claim is supported empirically by evaluating their utility in user conversion prediction, and preferred application prediction. According to the evaluation results, TRNN embeddings perform better than the baselines including Bag of Words (BoW), TFIDF and Doc2Vec. We believe that TRNN embeddings provide an effective representation for solving practical tasks such as recommendation, user segmentation and predictive analysis of business metrics.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111535", "output": "\"Extending Document Linking Capabilities with Dynamic Cross-Document Linking Services\"\n\nor \n\n\"Dynamic Cross-Document Linking for Enhanced Document Life Cycles\"\n\nor \n\n\"A Dynamically Extensible Framework for Cross-Document Linking and Integration\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, most existing document linking approaches show some shortcomings in terms of the offered link granularity and cannot easily be extended to support new document formats. More recently, we see new document formats such as the Office Open XMLi\u00be?OOXML standard which facilitate the linking to parts of certain document formats.

We show how gradient TD (GTD) reinforcement learning methods can be formally derived, not with respect to their original objective functions as previously attempted, but rather with respect to primal-dual saddle-point objective functions. We also conduct a saddle-point error analysis to obtain finite-sample bounds on their performance. Previous analyses of this class of algorithms use stochastic approximation techniques to prove asymptotic convergence, and no finite-sample analysis had been attempted. An accelerated algorithm is also proposed, namely GTD2-MP, which use proximal \\\"mirror maps\\\" to yield acceleration. The results of our theoretical analysis imply that the GTD family of algorithms are comparable and may indeed be preferred over existing least squares TD methods for off-policy learning, due to their linear complexity. We provide experimental results showing the improved performance of our accelerated gradient TD methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111537", "output": "Evaluating Task Difficulty and Target Selection on Small Displays: A Comparative Study of the ISO Multi-Directional Test and a Novel Multi-Directional Corner Task", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

They are necessary in the task of separating reliable predictions of a trained model from near random guesses, minimizing the rate of false positives, and other problem-specific tasks in applied machine learning. Many real problems have heteroscedastic stochastic outputs, which explains the need of input-dependent prediction intervals. This paper proposes to estimate the input-dependent prediction intervals by a separate extreme learning machine model, using variance of its predictions as a correction term accounting for the model uncertainty. The variance is estimated from the model\u2019s linear output layer with a weighted Jackknife method. The methodology is very fast, robust to heteroscedastic outputs, and handles both extremely large datasets and insufficient amount of training data.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111539", "output": "Uncertainty Propagation for Robust Speaker Recognition: A Comprehensive Approach to Addressing Distorted Speech Data", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Statistical uncertainty propagation has been introduced as a promising paradigm to address this challenge. So far, different uncertainty propagation methods have been proposed to compensate noise and reverberation in i-vectors in the context of speaker recognition. They have achieved promising results on small datasets such as YOHO and Wall Street Journal, but little or no improvement on the larger, highly variable NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE) corpus. In this paper, we propose a complete uncertainty propagation method, whereby we model the effect of uncertainty both in the computation of unbiased Baum-Welch statistics and in the derivation of the posterior expectation of the i-vector. We conduct experiments on the NIST-SRE corpus mixed with real domestic noise and reverberation from the CHiME-2 corpus and preprocessed by multichannel speech enhancement. The proposed method improves the equal error rate (EER) by 4% relative compared to a conventional i-vector based speaker verification baseline. This is to be compared with previous methods which degrade performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111540", "output": "\"Indexing and Visualizing Large-Scale Image Collections: A Scalable Paradigm for Exploratory Data Mining\"\n\nor\n\n\"Joint Indexing and Visualization of Large Image Collections: A Hybrid Approach for Efficient Exploration\"\n\nor\n\n\"Scalable Paradigm for Exploratory Data Mining in Large Image Collections: A", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Many works in the literature have addressed the indexing of large image collections for search purposes. However, there is a lack of support for exploratory data mining. One may want to wander around the images and experience serendipity in the exploration process. Thus, effective paradigms not only for organising, but also visualising these image collections become necessary. In this article, we present a study to jointly index and visualise large image collections. The work focuses on satisfying three constraints. First, large image collections, up to million of images, shall be handled. Second, dynamic collections, such as ever-growing collections, shall be processed in an incremental way, without reprocessing the whole collection at each modification. Finally, an intuitive and interactive exploration system shall be provided to the user to allow him to easily mine image collections. To this end, a data partitioning algorithm has been modified and proximity graphs have been used to fit the visualisation purpose. A custom web platform has been implemented to visualise the hierarchical and graph-based hybrid structure. The results of a user evaluation we have conducted show that the exploration of the collections is intuitive and smooth thanks to the proposed structure. Furthermore, the scalability of the proposed indexing method is proved using large public image collections.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111541", "output": "\"Tongue-Operated Interface for Enhanced Accessibility: A Computer Vision Approach to Overcoming Dexterity Limitations\"\n\nor \n\n\"Tongue-Based Human-Computer Interaction for Individuals with Motor Disabilities: A Novel Application of Computer Vision\"\n\nor \n\n\"Substituting Sensory Input: Developing a Tongue-Operated Interface", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The precision of semantic service matching becomes a critical factor in ensuring the correctness of functionalities in system processes. However, the dependability of semantic service matching cannot be warranted in complex contexts. To improve semantic service matching for industrial systems, a context-based semantic service matching approach named 'Process-Based service MatchMaker'(PBMM) is proposed in this paper. It selects the suitable services for the process from candidate services through taking the dependencies of related services process into consideration.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "111543", "output": "Inversion of GNSS-R Observables for Estimating Above Ground Biomass in Landes Forest using Multi-Resolution Approaches", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Moreover, the ultimate translation of novel image analysis procedures to the clinic requires rigorous validation and evaluation of alternative schemes, a task that is best outsourced to the international research community. We commonly see an increase of the number of metrics to be used in parallel, reflecting alternative ways to measure similarity. Since different measures come with different scales and distributions, these are often normalized or converted into an individual rank ordering, leaving the problem of combining the set of multiple rankings into a final score. Proposed solutions are averaging or accumulation of rankings, raising the question if different metrics are to be treated the same or if all metrics would be needed to assess closeness to truth. We address this issue with a data-driven method for automatic estimation of weights for a set of metrics based on unsupervised rank aggregation. Our method requires no normalization procedures and makes no assumptions about metric distributions. We explore the sensitivity of metrics to small changes in input data with an iterative perturbation scheme, to prioritize the contribution of the most robust metrics in the overall ranking. We show on real anatomical data that our weighting scheme can dramatically change the ranking.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111545", "output": "\"Exploring the Interplay between SDN Hardware and Software: Lessons from a Real-World Deployment\"\n\nor \n\n\"Unveiling the Intersections of SDN Hardware and Controller Design: Insights from a Production Enterprise Network\"\n\nor \n\n\"SDN Hardware and Software Coexistence: A Study of Practical Limitations and Future", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this environment high memory access latency, also known as memory wall, becomes the biggest data processing bottleneck. Traditional CPU-based architectures solved this problem by introducing large cache hierarchies. However algorithms which experience poor locality can limit the benefits of caching. In turn, hardware multithreading provides a generic solution that does not rely on algorithm-specific locality properties. In this paper we present an FPGA-accelerated implementation of in-memory group-by hash aggregation. Our design relies on hardware multithreading to efficiently mask long memory access latency by implementing a custom operation datapath on FPGA. We propose using CAMs (Content Addressable Memories) as a mechanism of synchronization and local pre-aggregation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work, which uses CAMs as a synchronizing cache. We evaluate aggregation throughput against the state-of-the-art multithreaded software implementations and demonstrate that the FPGA-accelerated approach significantly outperforms them on large grouping key cardinalities and yields speedup up to 10x.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111547", "output": "Automatic Gleason Score Assistance using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Ensemble Classifiers for Enhanced Pathologist-Computer Interaction", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In order to detect and classify the cancerous tissue, a deep convolutional neural network that had been pre-trained on a large set of photographic images was used. A specific aim was to support intuitive interaction with the result, to let pathologists adjust and correct the output. Therefore, we have designed an algorithm that makes a spatial classification of the whole slide into the same growth patterns as pathologists do. The 22-layer network was cut at an earlier layer and the output from that layer was used to train both a random forest classifier and a support vector machines classifier. At a specific layer a small patch of the image was used to calculate a feature vector and an image is represented by a number of those vectors. We have classified both the individual patches and the entire images. The classification results were compared for different scales of the images and feature vectors from two different layers from the network. Testing was made on a dataset consisting of 213 images, all containing a single class, benign tissue or Gleason score 35. Using 10-fold cross validation the accuracy per patch was 81 %. For whole images, the accuracy was increased to 89 %.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111548", "output": "Decomposition of the Banzhaf Value Space via Strong Transfer Invariance and Dummy Player Axiom", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This is because 1) the output becomes discontinuous and nondifferentiable after quantization, making the conventional recursive backstepping design method unsuitable as the differentiation of the virtual control signals does not exist, while the existing backstepping-based quantized control method is only applicable to systems modeled in normal form or systems without mismatched uncertainties; 2) it is difficult to deal with the impacts of errors caused by output quantization when the virtual control laws contain time-varying estimates of unknown parameters; and 3) since only the quantized output signal is available, the effects of certain items related to unknown parameters in currently available observers become difficult to be explicitly addressed. In this article, we present a solution to this problem by employing a dynamic filtering technique to avoid differentiating virtual control signals in backstepping design, using the parameter projection technique to design the parameter estimator and proposing a new form of state observer to facilitate the development of output feedback control. It is shown that, with the derived adaptive backstepping control involving both input and output quantizations, all the closed-loop signals are ensured bounded and the control performance in terms of the mean square error is adjustable through properly choosing certain design parameters. The benefits and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are also validated by numerical simulation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111550", "output": "\"Automated Hybridization of Local Search Algorithms for Optimizing Complex Permutation Flowshop Problems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In the practical scenarios, uRLLC services have strict and diverse Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. However, the existing networks are difficult to meet the various delay and reliability requirements of uRLLC services. Moreover, the improvement of performance should not ignore the shortage of resources. A flexible and on-demand network solution is quite necessary, which could provide customized services according to the specific requirements and maximize the utilization efficiency of network resources. In this article, we propose an intelligent and flexible network solution (IFNS) based on the stochastic network calculus (SNC) model. Three key technologies are considered in the IFNS, that are flexible transmission time interval scheduling, flexible packet duplication transmission, and rate-adaptive reliable transmission. While providing customized services for users with various requirements, it realizes the balance between system energy efficiency and spectral efficiency and improves the resource utilization efficiency of the network. Based on the basic domain knowledge and the past experience, we propose the knowledge-assistance meta actor\u2013critic (K-MAC) algorithm to solve the complex optimization problem caused by SNC modeling. Finally, simulation results show that the performance of the IFNS is improved 23.15%, the K-MAC algorithm has good convergence performance and reduces the complexity up to 89.4% compared with common learning algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111552", "output": "\"Ensemble Pruning for Multi-Class Classification: A Dynamic and Efficient Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"A Novel Framework for Multi-Class Decomposition with One-Class Classifiers and Ensemble Pruning\"\n\nor\n\n\"Threshold-Based Selection Mechanism for Efficient Ensemble Pruning in Multi-Class Classification\"\n\nor\n\n\"Pruning and Ensemble Selection for Multi", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While concatenation of feature vectors has benefits in allowing all elements to interact, it is difficult to learn output classification. Differently, elementwise multiplication has the benefits in enabling multiplicative interaction, but it is difficult to learn input embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to combine the benefits of both categories based on a compact representation of two feature vectors' outer product, which is called the multimodal compact multi-linear pooling technique. We first propose to expand the bilinear pooling technique for two inputs to a multi-linear technique to accommodate for multiple inputs (multiple inputs from multiple spectra are frequent in the multispectral biometric context). This fusion approach not only allows all elements to interact and enables multiplicative interaction, but also uses a small number of parameters and low computation complexity. Based on this fusion proposal, we subsequently propose a complete multispectral periocular recognition system. Employing higher order spectra features with an elliptical sampling approach proposed by Algashaam et al., our proposed system achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both our own and the IIIT multispectral periocular data sets. The proposed approach can also be extended to other biometric modalities.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "111554", "output": "\"Integrating Process Mining Techniques for Multi-Perspective Hierarchical BPMN Models: A Novel Approach to Discovering Process Models from Event Logs\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Design/methodology/approach The integrated discovery approach presented in this work is aimed to mine: control, data and resource perspectives within one process diagram, and, if possible, construct a hierarchy of subprocesses improving the model readability. The proposed approach is defined as a sequence of steps, performed to discover a model, containing various perspectives and presenting a holistic view of a process. This approach was implemented within an open-source process mining framework called ProM and proved its applicability for the analysis of real-life event logs. Findings This paper shows that the proposed integrated approach can be applied to real-life event logs of information systems from different domains. The multi-perspective process diagrams obtained within the approach are of good quality and better than models discovered using a technique that does not consider hierarchy. Moreover, due to the decomposition methods applied, the proposed approach can deal with large event logs, which cannot be handled by methods that do not use decomposition. Originality/value The paper consolidates various process mining techniques, which were never integrated before and presents a novel approach for the discovery of multi-perspective hierarchical BPMN models. This approach bridges the gap between well-known process mining techniques and a wide range of BPMN-complaint tools.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "111555", "output": "\"Design and Characterization of Time-Mode Signal Processing Circuits with All-Digital Advantages\"\n\nor \n\n\"Experimental Demonstration of Time-Mode Signal Processing Circuits for Enhanced Digital Signal Processing\"\n\nor \n\n\"Second-Order Filter Prototypes for Time-Mode Signal Processing: A Comparative Analysis of Butterworth and Che", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A highly accurate and real-time VMMR system significantly reduces the overhead cost of resources otherwise required. The VMMR problem is a multi-class classification task with a peculiar set of issues and challenges like multiplicity, inter-and intra-make ambiguity among various vehicle makes and models, which need to be solved in an efficient and reliable manner to achieve a highly robust VMMR system. In this paper, facing the growing importance of make and model recognition of vehicles, we present an image dataset(1) with 9, 170 different classes of vehicles to advance the corresponding tasks. Extensive experiments conducted using baseline approaches yield superior results for images that were occluded, under low illumination, partial or non-frontal camera views, available in our VMMR dataset. The approaches presented herewith provide a robust VMMR system for applications in realistic environments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111557", "output": "Critical and Noncritical Multipliers for Variational Systems: A General Framework for Classical Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It has been well recognized that critical multipliers are largely responsible for slow convergence of major primal\u2013dual algorithms of optimization. The approach of this paper allows us to cover KKT systems arising in various classes of smooth and nonsmooth problems of constrained optimization including composite optimization, minimax problems, etc. Concentrating on a polyhedral subdifferential case and employing recent results of second-order subdifferential theory, we obtain complete characterizations of critical and noncritical multipliers via the problem data. It is shown that noncriticality is equivalent to a certain calmness property of a perturbed variational system and that critical multipliers can be ruled out by full stability of local minimizers in problems of composite optimization. For the latter class we establish the equivalence between noncriticality of multipliers and robust isolated calmness of the associated solution map and then derive explicit characterizations of these notions via appropriate second-order sufficient conditions. It is finally proved that the Lipschitz-like/Aubin property of solution maps yields their robust isolated calmness.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111558", "output": "Energy Retest Umpire (ERU): Leveraging Change Impact Analysis and Precomputed API Energy Usage for Efficient Energy Testing in Mobile Application Evolution", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Unfortunately, energy testing is expensive because it is a manual, labor\u2010intensive process that often requires multiple, separate, energy\u2010measuring devices to collect energy usage data. The high costs of energy testing can negatively affect the planning process of application evolution. For example, developers might be limited in the number of changes they can include in a release because they must conservatively plan to conduct energy testing after each change.In this paper, we present a new approach to provide developers with feedback on executing/skipping energy tests for proposed code changes. Our technique leverages change impact analysis and precomputed API energy usage information. More specifically, for a proposed change, the technique predicts whether energy testing will be required, and if so, which energy tests will need to be run. Such information may allow developers to avoid spending unnecessary time for energy testing and develop an effective application evolution timeline. To investigate the feasibility of our technique, we implemented a prototype for Android applications and conducted three case studies at different granularity levels on 10 Android applications.We present a technique, Energy Retest Umpire (ERU), that provides feedback on executing/skipping energy tests for proposed code changes.

At a high level, ERU leverages change impact analysis and pre\u2010computed API energy usage information.

The challenge of detecting neutrophils in presence of nucleated cells is solved using the recent advances of deep learning algorithms. Separation of SC layer, extraction of patches from the layer followed by classification of patches with respect to presence or absence of neutrophils form the basis of the overall approach which is effected through an integration of a U-Net based segmentation network and a capsule network for classification. The novel design of the present capsule net leads to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters without any noticeable compromise in the overall performance. The research further addresses the challenge of dealing with Mega-pixel images (in 10X) vis-a-vis Giga-pixel ones (in 40X). The promising result coming out of an experiment on a dataset consisting of 273 real-life images shows that a practical system is possible based on the present research.

Keeping up with such big data poses challenges in terms of both computational performance and energy efficiency, and motivates different approaches to explore data center systems and architectures. To better understand the processor design decisions in context of data analytics in data centers, we conduct comprehensive evaluations using representative data analaytics workloads on representative conventional multi-core and many-core processors. After a comprehensive analysis of performance, power, energy efficiency and performance-cost efficiency, we have the following observations: contrasted with the conventional wisdom that uses wimpy many-core processors to improve energy-efficiency, the brawny multi-core processors with SMT (simultaneous multithreading) and dynamic overclocking technologies outperform the counterparts in terms of not only execution time, but also energy-efficiency for most of data analytics workloads in our experiments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111561", "output": "\"Validating PID Control for Compliant Robotic Manipulators via Three-Time-Scale Singular Perturbation Analysis\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Current localization systems rely on the persistent storage of 3D point clouds of the scene to enable camera pose estimation, but such data reveals potentially sensitive scene information. This gives rise to significant privacy risks, especially as for many applications 3D mapping is a background process that the user might not be fully aware of. We pose the following question: How can we avoid disclosing confidential information about the captured 3D scene, and yet allow reliable camera pose estimation? This paper proposes the first solution to what we call privacy preserving image-based localization. The key idea of our approach is to lift the map representation from a 3D point cloud to a 3D line cloud. This novel representation obfuscates the underlying scene geometry while providing sufficient geometric constraints to enable robust and accurate 6-DOF camera pose estimation. Extensive experiments on several datasets and localization scenarios underline the high practical relevance of our proposed approach.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.94}, {"id": "111563", "output": "Hierarchical On-Demand Wireless Data Rate Provisioning for Space-Air-Ocean Integrated Networks: A Stackelberg Game Approach for USV QoE Enhancement", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, due to the restrictions of limited resources (e.g., spectrum bandwidth, transmission power, etc.), diverse demands of USVs, and selfishness of both UAVs and LEOs, there comes a significant challenge to provision high-quality wireless data rate for USVs to achieve their satisfied quality of experience (QoE). To this end, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical on-demand wireless data rate provisioning scheme to provide ubiquitous transmission services for USVs. Specifically, we first devise a hierarchical wireless data rate provisioning framework. The LEO satellite with an extensive wireless coverage is utilized to provide LEO satellite-to-UAV (L2U) data rate for UAVs with a certain L2U data rate price. Each UAV is employed to provide UAV-to-USV (U2U) data rate for covered multiple USVs with a certain U2U data rate price. We then propose a modified three-stage Stackelberg game to model the wireless data rate assignments among LEO satellites, UAVs, and USVs, where the time-varying data rate demands of USVs are considered to formulate the utility maximization problem. Afterwards, the backward induction approach is leveraged to attain the Stackelberg equilibrium as the solution of the formulated problem, where the closed-form expressions on the optimal strategies of both USVs and UAVs under different data rate budgets are obtained by the nonlinear programming method. Besides, an accelerated conjugate gradient descent (ACGD) based iteration algorithm is also designed to obtain the optimal strategies of the LEO satellites on the L2U data rate prices. At last, extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly increase the utilities of USVs, as compared to other benchmark schemes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "111564", "output": "Generalized sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (GSNMF) for probabilistic data representation: A framework for efficient manipulation of sparse matrices and factor matrices.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A number of methods have been proposed in the direction of exploring the social network, either locally (i.e. the vicinity of each user) or globally. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for collaborative filtering social recommendation that tries to combine the merits of both the aforementioned approaches, based on the soft-clustering of the Friend-of-a-Friend (FoaF) network of each user. This task is accomplished by the non-negative factorization of the adjacency matrix of the FoaF graph, while the edge-centric logic of the factorization algorithm is ameliorated by incorporating more general structural properties of the graph, such as the number of edges and stars, through the introduction of the exponential random graph models. The preliminary results obtained reveal the potential of this idea.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111566", "output": "Learning Grounding in Visual Semantics and Grammar through Video-Command Clustering and Probabilistic Relational Graphs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

No prior knowledge is assumed about the meaning of words, or the structure of the language, except that there are different classes of words (corresponding to observable actions, spatial relations, and objects and their observable properties). The learning process automatically clusters the continuous perceptual spaces into concepts corresponding to linguistic input. A novel relational graph representation is used to build connections between language and vision. As well as the grounding of language to perception, the system also induces a set of probabilistic grammar rules.

Instead of leveraging traditional low-level or handcrafted image priors as the restoration constraints, e.g., dark channels and increased contrast, we propose an end-to-end gated context aggregation network to directly restore the final haze-free image. In this network, we adopt the latest smoothed dilation technique to help remove the gridding artifacts caused by the widely-used dilated convolution with negligible extra parameters, and leverage a gated sub-network to fuse the features from different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can surpass previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, to demonstrate the generality of the proposed method, we further apply it to the image deraining task, which also achieves the state-of-the-art performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111569", "output": "\"Schema-Agnostic Progressive Entity Resolution: A Family of Methods for Heterogeneous Big Data Integration\"\n\n<similarpairs>\nSchema-Agnostic Progressive Entity Resolution, Schema-Agnostic ER, Progressive ER in Heterogeneous Datasets\nSchema-Agnostic Entity Resolution, Progressive ER for Big Data", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Progressive ER aims to efficiently resolve large datasets when limited time and/or computational resources are available. In practice, its goal is to provide the best possible partial solution by approximating the optimal comparison order of the entity profiles. So far, Progressive ER has only been examined in the context of structured (relational) data sources, as the existing methods rely on schema knowledge to save unnecessary comparisons: they restrict their search space to similar entities with the help of schema-based blocking keys (i.e., signatures that represent the entity profiles). As a result, these solutions are not applicable in Big Data integration applications, which involve large and heterogeneous datasets, such as relational and RDF databases, JSON files, Web corpus etc. To cover this gap, we propose a family of schema-agnostic Progressive ER methods, which do not require schema information, thus applying to heterogeneous data sources of any schema variety. First, we introduce two na\u00efve schema-agnostic methods, showing that straightforward solutions exhibit a poor performance that does not scale well to large volumes of data. Then, we propose four different advanced methods. Through an extensive experimental evaluation over 7 real-world, established datasets, we show that all the advanced methods outperform to a significant extent both the na\u00efve and the state-of-the-art schema-based ones. We also investigate the relative performance of the advanced methods, providing guidelines on the method selection.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111570", "output": "Based on the provided abstract, I will generate a title.

Although a number of resilience methods and power management techniques have been presented to address the reliability and energy concerns, the trade-offs among performance, power, and resilience are not well understood, especially in HPC systems with unprecedented scale and complexity. In this work, we present a co-modeling mechanism named TOPPER (system-wide Trade-Off modeling for Performance, PowEr, and Resilience).

In this paper, we focus on the Review-based Non-overlapped Recommendation (RNCDR) problem. The problem is commonly-existed and challenging due to two main aspects, i.e, there are only positive user-item ratings on the target domain and there is no overlapped user across different domains. Most previous CDR approaches cannot solve the RNCDR problem well, since (1) they cannot effectively combine review with other information (e.g., ID or ratings) to obtain expressive user or item embedding, (2) they cannot reduce the domain discrepancy on users and items. To fill this gap, we propose Collaborative Filtering with Attribution Alignment model (CFAA), a cross-domain recommendation framework for the RNCDR problem. CFAA includes two main modules, i.e., rating prediction module and embedding attribution alignment module. The former aims to jointly mine review, one-hot ID, and multi-hot historical ratings to generate expressive user and item embeddings. The later includes vertical attribution alignment and horizontal attribution alignment, tending to reduce the discrepancy based on multiple perspectives. Our empirical study on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrates that CFAA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models under the RNCDR setting.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111573", "output": "Balancing Long-Tailed Class Imbalance through Adaptive Partial Label Masking for Multi-Label Classification", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The imbalance in the ratio of positive and negative samples for each class skews network output probabilities further from ground-truth distributions. We propose a method, Partial Label Masking (PLM), which utilizes this ratio during training. By stochastically masking labels during loss computation, the method balances this ratio for each class, leading to improved recall on minority classes and improved precision on frequent classes. The ratio is estimated adaptively based on the network's performance by minimizing the KL divergence between predicted and ground-truth distributions. Whereas most existing approaches addressing data imbalance are mainly focused on single-label classification and do not generalize well to the multi-label case, this work proposes a general approach to solve the long-tail data imbalance issue for multi-label classification. PLM is versatile: it can be applied to most objective functions and it can be used alongside other strategies for class imbalance. Our method achieves strong performance when compared to existing methods on both multi-label (MultiMNIST and MSCOCO) and single-label (imbalanced CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) image classification datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111574", "output": "Model Predictive Control for Max-Plus Linear Systems with Stochastic Uncertainties under Probabilistic Constraints", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Different from classic reconstruction of physical depth in computer vision, we compute perceptually plausible disparity, that is numerically inaccurate, but results in a very similar overall depth impression with plausible overall layout, sharp edges, fine details and agreement between luminance and disparity. We use several simple monocular cues to estimate disparity maps and confidence maps of low spatial and temporal resolution in real-time. These are complemented by spatially-varying, appearancedependent and class-specific disparity prior maps, learned from example stereo images. Scene classification selects this prior at runtime. Fusion of prior and cues is done by means of robust MAP inference on a dense spatio-temporal conditional random field with high spatial and temporal resolution. Using normal distributions allows this in constant-time, parallel per-pixel work. We compare our approach to previous 2D-to-3D conversion systems in terms of different metrics, as well as a user study.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111576", "output": "\"Breaking the Hash: Advances in Cryptanalysis of Compression Functions and Meta-Structures\"\n\nor \n\n\"Unraveling the Code: New Techniques for Cryptanalysis of Hash Functions\"\n\nor \n\n\"Collision Attacks on SHA-0 and SHA-1: A New Era in Hash Function Cryptanalysis\"\n\nor \n\n\"Cracking", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

First, the nonlinear parabolic PDE system is exactly represented by a Takagi\u2013Sugeno fuzzy PDE model. Second, with taking the insecure transmission network into consideration, a more practical stochastic hybrid cyber attacks model for PDE-based networked control systems is introduced. This model contains both denial-of-service attacks and deception attacks in a unified framework. Then, based on spatially pointwise nonuniform sampled-data measurements, an adaptive event-triggered control scheme with an adjustable threshold is newly designed to counter the hybrid cyber attacks\u2019 impact while saving communication resources. Moreover, by constructing a novel Lyapunov\u2013Krasovskii functional and employing some inequality techniques, stability conditions with less conservatism are derived. Finally, the developed method is applied to the Fisher equation to demonstrate its viability and superiority.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111578", "output": "\"Root Cause Analysis via Iterative Provenance: A Novel Approach to Machine Learning Pipeline Failures\"\n\nor\n\n\"Inferring Root Causes through Iterative Provenance: A Quantitative and Qualitative Solution for Machine Learning Pipeline Failures\"\n\nor\n\n\"Provenance-Assisted Iterative Diagnosis: A Scalable", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

If some of the activities in a pipeline produce erroneous or uninformative outputs, the pipeline may fail or produce incorrect results. Inferring the root cause of failures and unexpected behavior is challenging, usually requiring much human thought, and is both time consuming and error prone. We propose a new approach that makes use of iteration and provenance to automatically infer the root causes and derive succinct explanations of failures. Through a detailed experimental evaluation, we assess the cost, precision, and recall of our approach compared to the state of the art. Our source code and experimental data will be available for reproducibility and enhancement.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.13}, {"id": "111579", "output": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and Massive MIMO for Enhanced Spectral and Energy Efficiency in 5G- and Beyond Wireless Networks", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As ARM servers make inroads in cloud infrastructure deployments, supporting nested virtualization on ARM is a key requirement, which has been met recently with the introduction of nested virtualization support to the ARM architecture. We build the first hypervisor to use ARM nested virtualization support and show that despite similarities between ARM and x86 nested virtualization support, performance on ARM is much worse than on x86. This is due to excessive traps to the hypervisor caused by differences in non-nested virtualization support. To address this problem, we introduce a novel paravirtualization technique to rapidly prototype architectural changes for virtualization and evaluate their performance impact using existing hardware. Using this technique, we propose Nested Virtualization Extensions for ARM (NEVE), a set of simple architectural changes to ARM that can be used by software to coalesce and defer traps by logging the results of hypervisor instructions until the results are actually needed by the hypervisor or virtual machines. We show that NEVE allows hypervisors running real application workloads to provide an order of magnitude better performance than current ARM nested virtualization support and up to three times less overhead than x86 nested virtualization. NEVE will be included in ARMv8.4, the next version of the ARM architecture.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111581", "output": "\"Efficient Vertex Deletion for Pseudoforest Construction: A Polynomial-Time Algorithm with Exponential Factor Dependence on k\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Within educational applications, recent empirical research has shown that signal-level features of students\u2019 writing, such as stroke distance, pressure and duration, are adapted to conserve total energy expenditure as they consolidate expertise in a domain. The present research examined how accurately three different machine-learning algorithms could automatically classify users\u2019 domain expertise based on signal features of their writing, without any content analysis. Compared with an unguided machine-learning classification accuracy of 71%, hybrid methods using empirical-statistical guidance correctly classified 79\u201392% of students by their domain expertise level. In addition to improved accuracy, the hybrid approach contributed a causal understanding of prediction success and generalization to new data. These novel findings open up opportunities to design new automated learning analytic systems and student-adaptive educational technologies for the rapidly expanding sector of commercial pen systems.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111583", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"BCI Emotion Recognition\",\n\"Emotion-Driven BCI Paradigm\",\n\"Recognition of Emotions in BCI Systems\",\n\"Emotion Recognition in Brain-Computer Interfaces\",\n\"BCI Paradigm Based on Em", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The term BCI-illiteracy' describes the impossibility of using a BCI paradigm. At present, a universal solution does not exist and seeking innovative protocols to drive a BCI is mandatory. This work presents a meta-analytic review on recent advances in emotions recognition with the perspective of using emotions as voluntary, stimulus-independent, commands for BCIs. 60 papers, based on electroencephalography measurements, were selected to evaluate what emotions have been most recognised and what brain regions were activated by them. It was found that happiness, sadness, anger and calm were the most recognised emotions. Relevant discriminant locations for emotions recognition and for the particular case of discrete emotions recognition were identified in the temporal, frontal and parietal areas. The meta-analysis was mainly performed on stimulus-elicited emotions, due to the limited amount of literature about self-induced emotions. The obtained results represent a good starting point for the development of BCI driven by emotions and allow to: (1) ascertain that emotions are measurable and recognisable one from another (2) select a subset of most recognisable emotions and the corresponding active brain regions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111584", "output": "\"Privacy-Preserving Fingerprint Authentication for Resource-Constrained IoT Devices: A Novel, Cancelable Template-Based Approach\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Secure Fingerprint Authentication for IoT Environments\"\n\"Fingerprint-Based Authentication for Resource-Constrained Devices\"\n\"Privacy-Preserving Biometric Authentication for IoT Systems\"\n\"Cancelable F", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To overcome the inherent weakness of password-based authentication, many present IoT devices (e.g., commercial banking smart cards) are equipped with the fingerprint authentication mechanism. However, due to the resource constraints of IoT devices, oversimplified authentication schemes are deployed, which compromise system performance significantly. Moreover, fingerprint templates in these existing schemes are unprotected. To address these issues, we propose an IoT-oriented privacy-preserving fingerprint authentication system. The proposed system is composed of four main components: 1) minutiae extraction; 2) the minutia cylinder-code (MCC)-based cancelable binary template, generated by the proposed normalized random projection; 3) the lightweight, privacy-preserving template, built by novel pairwise Boolean operations; and 4) fingerprint matching. Our system can effectively mitigate preimage and hill-climbing attacks. A prototype of the proposed system is developed using a popular open-source platform (i.e., Open Virtual Platforms). Comprehensive experimental results on eight benchmark data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed IoT-oriented fingerprint authentication system. Our system also achieves equivalent authentication accuracy to that of the unprotected fingerprint authentication systems deployed in the resource-rich, non-IoT environment. More importantly, our system prototype is deployable to commercially available low-cost smart cards, such as Atmel AT24C256C Memory Smart Card 256K Bits. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed system is the first privacy-preserving, cancelable fingerprint authentication system developed in such a resource-constrained IoT setting.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111585", "output": "Detecting Metaphorical Word Use in Context with BiLSTM Models: A New State-of-the-Art Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It remains the largest manually annotated corpus of discourse relations to date. Its focus on discourse relations that are either lexically-grounded in explicit discourse connectives or associated with sentential adjacency has not only facilitated its use in language technology and psycholinguistics but also has spawned the annotation of comparable corpora in other languages and genres. Given this situation, this paper has four aims: (1) to provide a comprehensive introduction to the PDTB for those who are unfamiliar with it; (2) to correct some wrong (or perhaps inadvertent) assumptions about the PDTB and its annotation that may have weakened previous results or the performance of decision procedures induced from the data; (3) to explain variations seen in the annotation of comparable resources in other languages and genres, which should allow developers of future comparable resources to recognize whether the variations are relevant to them; and (4) to enumerate and explain relationships between PDTB annotation and complementary annotation of other linguistic phenomena. The paper draws on work done by ourselves and others since the corpus was released.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.54}, {"id": "111587", "output": "\"Ultra-Wideband RF Localization for Decimeter-Scale Accuracy: A Novel Harmonium Architecture\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Ultra-Wideband\", \"RF Localization\", \"Decimeter-Scale Accuracy\"]\n[\"Novel Architecture\", \"Indoor Localization\", \"UWB-Based\"]\n[\"Commodity Components\", \"Fast and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Harmonium strikes a balance between tag simplicity and processing complexity to provide fast and accurate indoor location estimates. Harmonium uses only commodity components and consists of a small, inexpensive, lightweight, and FCC-compliant UWB transmitter or tag, fixed infrastructure anchors with known locations, and centralized processing that calculates the tag\u2019s position. Anchors employ a new frequency-stepped narrowband receiver architecture that rejects narrowband interferers and extracts high-resolution timing information without the cost or complexity of traditional UWB approaches. In a complex indoor environment, 90% of position estimates obtained with Harmonium exhibit less than 31 cm of error with an average of 9 cm of inter-sample noise. In non-line-of-sight conditions (i.e., through-wall), 90% of position error is less than 42 cm. The tag draws 75 mW when actively transmitting, or 3.9 mJ per location fix at the 19 Hz update rate. Tags weigh 3 g and cost $4.50 USD at modest volumes. Furthermore, VLSI-based design concepts are identified for a simple, low-power realization of the Harmonium tag to offer a roadmap for the realization of Harmonium concepts in future integrated systems. Harmonium introduces a new design point for indoor localization and enables localization of small, fast objects such as micro quadrotors, devices previously restricted to expensive optical motion capture systems.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111588", "output": "\"Kardam: Byzantine-Resilient Asynchronous Distributed Machine Learning via Filtering and Dampening Components\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We introduce emph{Kardam}, the first distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that copes with Byzantine workers. Kardam consists of two complementary components: a filtering and a dampening component. The first is scalar-based and ensures resilience against $frac{1}{3}$ Byzantine workers. Essentially, this filter leverages the Lipschitzness of cost functions and acts as a self-stabilizer against Byzantine workers that would attempt to corrupt the progress of SGD. The dampening component bounds the convergence rate by adjusting to stale information through a generic gradient weighting scheme. We prove that Kardam guarantees almost sure convergence in the presence of asynchrony and Byzantine behavior, and we derive its convergence rate. We evaluate Kardam on the CIFAR-100 and EMNIST datasets and measure its overhead with respect to non Byzantine-resilient solutions. We empirically show that Kardam does not introduce additional noise to the learning procedure but does induce a slowdown (the cost of Byzantine resilience) that we both theoretically and empirically show to be less than $f/n$, where $f$ is the number of Byzantine failures tolerated and $n$ the total number of workers. Interestingly, we also empirically observe that the dampening component is interesting in its own right for it enables to build an SGD algorithm that outperforms alternative staleness-aware asynchronous competitors in environments with honest workers.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111589", "output": "\"Integrating Process Mining with Big Data Analytics for Flexible Business Intelligence\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Developed in the database community, The traditional ETL-data warehouse-OLAP approach to BI is effective to deal with multi-dimensional data (i.e. data cubes) but not suitable for flexible analytics such as exploration with ad hoc queries and process/data changes. Process mining techniques developed in the BPM community focus on activities and control flow but ignore data. In this paper, we propose a new framework for business analytics based on workflow logs. We introduce the key notions, illustrate querying logs as one useful aspect, and then discuss a range of interesting technical problems to be studied further.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.32}, {"id": "111590", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Two-Way Relay Channel with Physical Layer Network Coding and Space-Time Coding Using Coordinate Interleaved Orthogonal Designs\"\n\"Two-Node Two-Way Relay Channel with Adaptive Network Coding and Space-Time Coding\"\n</similarpairs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It is shown that using two uncorrelated transmit antennas at the nodes, but using only one RF transmit chain and space-time coding across these antennas can give a better performance without using any extra resources and without increasing the hardware implementation cost and complexity. In the first transmission scheme, two antennas are used only at the relay, Adaptive Network Coding (ANC) is employed at the relay and the relay transmits a CIOD Space Time Block Code (STBC). This gives a better performance compared to an existing ANC scheme for two-way relay channel which uses one antenna each at all the three nodes. It is shown that for this scheme at high SNR the average end-to-end symbol error probability (SEP) is upper bounded by twice the SEP of a point-to-point fading channel. In the second transmission scheme, two transmit antennas are used at all the three nodes, CIOD STBC's are transmitted in multiple access and broadcast phases. This scheme provides a diversity order of two for the average end-to-end SEP with an increased decoding complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(M^3)$ for an arbitrary signal set and $\\mathcal{O}(M^2\\sqrt{M})$ for square QAM signal set.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111591", "output": "\"Open-Source Foundations for Predicting Novice Interface Exploration: A Comparative Analysis of Information Scent Estimation Algorithms\"\n\nor\n\n\"Novice Interface Exploration: A Comparative Study of Open-Source Information Scent Estimation Approaches\"\n\nor\n\n\"Unlocking the Potential of Open-Source Information Scent: A Research", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These tools depend on obtaining quantitative estimates of information scent, which usually requires a large corpus of documents representing the background knowledge of target users and an algorithm that uses this corpus to calculate the information scent between a user's goal and the labels in the GUI. Prior work has often used proprietary algorithms and propriety, now outdated corpora. This note presents an open source approach to information scent that is as good a foundation for research and practice as a previously published proprietary system, exemplifies its use in CogTool-Explorer, and opens the door for researchers to explore many important questions about novice exploration of interfaces.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111592", "output": "\"Direct Convolution: A Memory-Efficient and Scalable Approach to Convolution Layers in Deep Neural Networks\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The problems with such an approach are two-fold. First, these routines incur additional memory overhead which reduces the overall size of the network that can fit on embedded devices with limited memory capacity. Second, these high performance routines were not optimized for performing convolution, which means that the performance obtained is usually less than conventionally expected. In this paper, we demonstrate that direct convolution, when implemented correctly, eliminates all memory overhead, and yields performance that is between 10% to 400% times better than existing high performance implementations of convolution layers on conventional and embedded CPU architectures. We also show that a high performance direct convolution exhibits better scaling performance, i.e. suffers less performance drop, when increasing the number of threads.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111593", "output": "\"Prompt-Based Reinforcement Learning for Offline Recommendation: A Novel Paradigm for Maximizing User Reward\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Prompt-Based Reinforcement Learning\", \"Offline Recommendation\"]\n[\"Reinforcement Learning for Recommendation\", \"Offline Training\"]\n[\"Learning from Historical Data\", \"Knowledge-Based Recommendation\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As reinforcement learning (RL) naturally fits this objective---maximizing an user's reward per session---it has become an emerging topic in recommender systems. Developing RL-based recommendation methods, however, is not trivial due to the offline training challenge. Specifically, the keystone of traditional RL is to train an agent with large amounts of online exploration making lots of 'errors' in the process. In the recommendation setting, though, we cannot afford the price of making 'errors' online. As a result, the agent needs to be trained through offline historical implicit feedback, collected under different recommendation policies; traditional RL algorithms may lead to sub-optimal policies under these offline training settings. Here we propose a new learning paradigm---namely Prompt-Based Reinforcement Learning (PRL)---for the offline training of RL-based recommendation agents. While traditional RL algorithms attempt to map state-action input pairs to their expected rewards (e.g., Q-values), PRL directly infers actions (i.e., recommended items) from state-reward inputs. In short, the agents are trained to predict a recommended item given the prior interactions and an observed reward value---with simple supervised learning. At deployment time, this historical (training) data acts as a knowledge base, while the state-reward pairs are used as a prompt. The agents are thus used to answer the question: Which item should be recommended given the prior interactions & the prompted reward value? We implement PRL with four notable recommendation models and conduct experiments on two real-world e-commerce datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111594", "output": "\"Joint Data Gathering and Energy Harvesting Optimization for Rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks with a Mobile Sink\"\n\nor\n\n\"Far-Relay Assisted Data Transmission and Energy Harvesting in Rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks with a Mobile Sink\"\n\nor\n\n\"Buffer-Battery-Aware Adaptive Scheduling for Joint Data Gathering and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In RWSNs, the sensor nodes are equipped with RF circuit to harvest energy from a mobile sink that moves along a pre-defined path, and at the same time, transmit gathered sensor data to the sink. Given that the consumed and harvested energy at a sensor node is proportional and inversely proportional to the square of transmission distance, a far-relay approach is proposed to select the sensor nodes closer to the path to assist the data transmission of the farther sensor nodes. Under the far-relay approach, we formulate a network utility maximization problem (NUM), and propose an optimal scheduling scheme (Opt-JoDGE), which jointly considers the power allocation, relay selection and time slot scheduling policies. By employing the Lyapunov drift theory, a near optimal buffer-battery-aware adaptive scheduling (NO-BBA) scheme is further proposed, in which the run-time status of the data buffer and battery are utilized. Extensive simulation experiments validate the feasibility and performance of JoDGE and NO-BBA. The results show that the performance of NO-BBA is close to that of Opt-JoDGE, especially when a certain delay is tolerable.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111595", "output": "\"Optimizing Ring Oscillator PUF Reliability through Current Starvation Biasing\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This evolution is a direct result of the explosion of user-generated content, explained by the wide adoption of social network platforms. The vast amount of multimedia content requires effective management and retrieval techniques. Nevertheless, Web multimedia retrieval is a complex task because users commonly express their information needs in semantic terms, but expect multimedia content in return. This dissociation between semantics and content of multimedia is known as the semantic gap. To solve this, researchers are looking beyond content-based or text-based approaches, integrating novel data sources. New data sources can consist of any type of data extracted from the context of multimedia documents, defined as the data that is not part of the raw content of a multimedia file. The Web is an extraordinary source of context data, which can be found in explicit or implicit relation to multimedia objects, such as surrounding text, tags, hyperlinks, and even in relevance-feedback. Recent advances in Web multimedia retrieval have shown that context data has great potential to bridge the semantic gap. In this article, we present the first comprehensive survey of context-based approaches for multimedia information retrieval on the Web. We introduce a data-driven taxonomy, which we then use in our literature review of the most emblematic and important approaches that use context-based data. In addition, we identify important challenges and opportunities, which had not been previously addressed in this area.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111597", "output": "\"Planarity and Choosability: Extending the 4-Choosability Result to Chordal Graphs\"\n\nor\n\n\"4-Choosability of Planar Graphs without Chordal 6-Cycles: A Generalization of a Known Result\"\n\nor\n\n\"Planar Graphs without Ch", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The concept is studied with different terminology and perspectives, including individual, social, legal and philosophical. If a norm is an expected behaviour in a social setting, then this article considers how it can be determined whether an individual is adhering to this expected behaviour. We call this process monitoring, and again it is a concept known with different terminology in different fields. Monitoring of norms is foundational for processes of accountability, enforcement, regulation and sanctioning. Starting with a broad focus and narrowing to the multi-agent systems literature, this survey addresses four key questions: what is monitoring, what is monitored, who does the monitoring and how the monitoring is accomplished.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111599", "output": "\"Optimizing Multiple-Supply Voltage and Level Shifter Placement in Low Power Design using a Two-Phase Algorithm Framework\"\n\nor alternatively:\n\n\"A Two-Phase Framework for Efficient Voltage and Level Shifter Assignment in Low Power CMOS Design\"\n\nor also:\n\n\"VLSAF: A Novel Two-Phase Algorithm for Effective", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Multiple-Supply Voltage (MSV) is a popular and effective method for both dynamic and static power reduction while maintaining performance. Level shifters may cause area and Interconnect Length Overhead (ILO), and should be considered at both floorplanning and post-floorplanning stages. In this paper, we propose a two phases algorithm framework, called VLSAF, to solve voltage and level shifter assignment problem. At floorplanning phase, we use a convex cost network flow algorithm to assign voltage and a minimum cost flow algorithm to handle level-shifter assignment. At post-floorplanning phase, a heuristic method is adopted to redistribute white spaces and calculate the positions and shapes of level shifters. The experimental results show VLSAF is effective.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111600", "output": "Hierarchical Monitoring System for Large-Scale Distributed Services Using Machine Learning-Based Frameworks", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Due to the non-convex constraints, traditional optimization-based algorithms either obtain sub-optimal solutions or take exponential complexity to reach the optimum. In this paper, we propose a learning based branch-and-bound (LBB) algorithm for solving the considered CMCPs. LBB regards the search procedure of the global optimal argument-cut based branch-and-bound (AC-BB) algorithm as a sequential decision problem in a binary tree and learns the optimal pruning policy via supervised learning. We first propose to apply ensemble learning to train multiple classifiers and then combine them to achieve better performance. To tackle the imbalanced issue, we propose an undersampling-supervised learning method to sample several balanced subsets and train a classifier on each of them. We also show that the computational complexity of LBB is determined by the depth of the binary tree and give its expression in the worst case. Finally, we validate the proposed LBB with two classic problems in wireless communications, i.e., multicast beamforming and MIMO detection. Numerical results show that LBB runs significantly faster than AC-BB while achieving nearly the same optimal performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111602", "output": "\"Unlocking the Power of Listening Experience: The Listening Experience Database (LED) as a Centralized Hub for Digitized Evidence\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Studies in the Humanities, on the other hand, have been hindered by the lack of structured evidence of actual experiences of listening as reported by the listeners themselves, a concern that was voiced since the early Web era. It was however assumed that such evidence existed, albeit in pure textual form, but could not be leveraged until it was digitised and aggregated. The Listening Experience Database (LED) responds to this research need by providing a centralised hub for evidence of listening in the literature. Not only does LED support search and reuse across nearly 10,000 records, but it also provides machine-readable structured data of the knowledge around the contexts of listening. To take advantage of the mass of formal knowledge that already exists on the Web concerning these contexts, the entire framework adopts Linked Data principles and technologies. This also allows LED to directly reuse open data from the British Library for the source documentation that is already published. Reused data are re-published as open data with enhancements obtained by expanding over the model of the original data, such as the partitioning of published books and collections into individual stand-alone documents. The database was populated through crowdsourcing and seamlessly incorporates data reuse from the very early data entry phases. As the sources of the evidence often contain vague, fragmentary of uncertain information, facilities were put in place to generate structured data out of such fuzziness. Alongside elaborating on these functionalities, this article provides insights into the most recent features of the latest instalment of the dataset and portal, such as the interlinking with the MusicBrainz database, the relaxation of geographical input constraints through text mining, and the plotting of key locations in an interactive geographical browser.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "111603", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Overcoming Social Barriers for Newcomers in Open Source Software Communities\"\n\"Supporting Newcomers in OSS Projects: A Study on Social Barriers and Solutions\"\n\"Social Barriers to Newcomer Invol", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, newcomers face many barriers when making their first contribution, leading in many cases to dropouts. Due to the collaborative nature of community-based OSS projects, newcomers may be susceptible to social barriers, such as communication breakdowns and reception issues. In this article, we report a two-phase study aimed at better understanding social barriers faced by newcomers. In the first phase, we qualitatively analyzed the literature and data collected from practitioners to identify barriers that hinder newcomers\u2019 first contribution. We designed a model composed of 58 barriers, including 13 social barriers. In the second phase, based on the barriers model, we developed FLOSScoach, a portal to support newcomers making their first contribution. We evaluated the portal in a diary-based study and found that the portal guided the newcomers and reduced the need for communication. Our results provide insights for communities that want to support newcomers and lay a foundation for building better onboarding tools. The contributions of this paper include identifying and gathering empirical evidence of social barriers faced by newcomers; understanding how social barriers can be reduced or avoided by using a portal that organizes proper information for newcomers (FLOSScoach); presenting guidelines for communities and newcomers on how to reduce or avoid social barriers; and identifying new streams of research.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111604", "output": "\"Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Planning via Probabilistic Inference and Motion Planning\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Estimation and planning problems are usually considered separately, however, within our framework we show that solving them simultaneously can be more accurate and efficient. The key idea is to compute the full continuous-time trajectory from start to goal at each time-step. While the robot traverses the trajectory, the history portion of the trajectory signifies the solution to the estimation problem, and the future portion of the trajectory signifies a solution to the planning problem. Building on recent probabilistic inference approaches to continuous-time localization and mapping and continuous-time motion planning, we solve the joint problem by iteratively recomputing the maximum a posteriori trajectory conditioned on all available sensor data and cost information. Our approach can contend with high-degree-of-freedom trajectory spaces, uncertainty due to limited sensing capabilities, model inaccuracy, the stochastic effect of executing actions, and can find a solution in real-time. We evaluate our framework empirically in both simulation and on a mobile manipulator.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111605", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Context Tree Based Modelling of Turbo Decoder Error Patterns\",\n\"Modeling Error Patterns at Turbo Decoder Output using Context Tree Based Techniques\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\nWord frequencies:\n- \"turbo\" (4)\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This model can be used not only to generate the decoder error pattern behaviour with little effort, avoiding simulations, but also to investigate - with no need of performing neither a turbo code distance spectrum analysis, nor the probabilistic characterization of log-likelihood ratios or of the extrinsic information at a turbo decoder output - the performance of hybrid concatenated coding (HCC) schemes having a turbo code as component code. These coding schemes combine the features of parallel and serially concatenated codes and thus offer more freedom in code design. It has been demonstrated, in fact, that HCCs can perform closer to capacity than serially concatenated codes while still maintaining a minimum distance that grows linearly with block length.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111606", "output": "\"Expected Spanning Tree Count in Random Graphs with Large Degree Sequences\"\n\nor\n\n\"Concentration Results for Spanning Trees in Random Graphs with Given Degrees\"\n\nor\n\n\"Pr\u00fcfer Codes and the Expected Number of Spanning Trees in Random Graphs\"\n\nor\n\n\"Spanning Tree Expectation in Random", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The proposed algorithms are extensions of the existing GPI algorithm that consists of the approximate policy evaluation and policy improvement steps. The two proposed schemes, named heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) and dual HDP (DHP), based on multirate GPI, use multi-step estimation (M-step Bellman equation) at the approximate policy evaluation step for estimating the value function and its gradient called costate, respectively. Then, we show that these two methods with the same update horizon can be considered equivalent in the iteration domain. Furthermore, monotonically increasing and decreasing convergences, so called value iteration (VI)-mode and policy iteration (PI)-mode convergences, are proved to hold for the proposed multirate GPIs. Further, general convergence properties in terms of eigenvalues are also studied. The data-driven online implementation methods for the proposed HDP and DHP are demonstrated and finally, we present the results of numerical simulations performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.07}, {"id": "111608", "output": "\"Unraveling the Complexity of Smartphone Game Addiction: A Three-Stage Process of Maladaptive Behaviors\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Unraveling the Complexity of\", \"Breaking the Cycle of\", \"Exploring the Mechanisms of\", \"Understanding the Dynamics of\"]\n\n<features>\n\nWord frequency analysis:\n- \"add", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Social cognitive theory serves as a framework for interpreting the failure of decreased behavior with a three-stage process. Following this perspective, key drivers in each process are proposed to explain the underlying reasons. A longitudinal survey with 381 valid responses was conducted. Results indicate that addicts with intention to decrease playing games may attempt to suppress their playing thought. Then, intrusive thought of playing games and impulsive playing emerge in the first stage. The ubiquity feature of smartphone strengthens the positive influence of intrusive thought on impulsive playing. In the second self-judgment stage, addicts perceive a higher level of difficulty to decrease, which further leads to deficient self-efficacy. These maladaptive judgments reduce the reaction of decreased behavior. This study is one of the first ones to reveal key factors causing decrease failure in the context of smartphone game addiction. Implications are offered.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111609", "output": "Based on the provided abstract, I will generate a title.

Normally, information that can be obtained from a video is limited to the number of steps and average stride length. However, our proposed method makes it possible to measure not only this information, but also time-scale information like every stride length and speed transition from the same input. Our proposed method can be divided into three steps. First, we generate a panoramic image of the 100-m track. By doing this, we can estimate where the runners are running in a frame at the 100-meter scale. Second, we detect whether the runner steps in the frame. For this process, we utilize the detected track lines and leg joint positions of runners. Finally, we project every steps to the overview image of the 100-m track to estimate the stride length at the 100-m scale. In the experiment part, we apply our method to various race videos. We evaluate the accuracy of our method via comparison with the data measured using typical methods. In addition, we evaluate the accuracy of estimation of the number of steps and show visualized runners' steps and speed transitions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.07}, {"id": "111610", "output": "\"Enhancing Clinical Efficiency in COVID-19 Diagnosis via Deep Learning for Localisation of Disease Regions from Limited CT Imaging Data\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Different from previous solutions of coping with wearout issues (e.g. BTI) by \\\"tolerating\\\", \\\"slowing down\\\" or \\\"compensating\\\", which still leave the irreversible (permanent) wearout component unchecked, the proposed solution is able to fully avoid the irreversible wearout through periodic rejuvenation, and this is inspired by the explored frequency dependent behaviors of wearout and (accelerated and active) recovery based on measurements on FPGAs. We demonstrate a case where the chip can always be brought back to the fresh status by employing a pattern of 31-h regular operation (under room temperature and nominal voltage) followed by a 1-h accelerated self-healing (under high temperature and negative voltage). The proposed system integrates the notions of accelerated self-healing across multiple layers of the system stack. At the circuit level, a negative voltage generator and heating elements are designed and implemented; at the architecture level, the core can be allocated in a way such that the dark silicon or redundant resources can be healed by active elements; at the system level, right balance of stress and accelerated/active recovery can be employed by the system scheduler to fully mitigate the wearout; various wearout sensors act as the media between different layers. Overall, these techniques work together to guarantee that the whole system performs for more of the time at higher levels of performance and power efficiency by fully taking advantage of the extra opportunities enabled by the accelerated self-healing. HighlightsWearout (e.g. BTI) can be reversed significantly by accelerated and active recovery (accelerated self-healing) techniques.Irreversible component of wearout can be fully avoided through the optimal active and sleep scheduling.A cross-layer accelerated self-healing system which integrates the accelerated and recovery techniques across the system stack is proposed.Accelerated self-healing should be introduced as a key design knob for cross-layer resilience.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "111614", "output": "Designing Internet of Tangibles: A Studio for Richer User Interactions with the Internet of Things\n\n<similarpairs>\nDesigning Internet of Things, Designing Internet of Services\nDesigning Tangible User Interfaces, Designing Interactive Systems\nDesigning Internet of Things Experiences, Designing IoT Applications\n\n<features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In reality, some sentences are well-learned during the initial few epochs; however, using this approach, the well-learned sentences would continue to be trained along with those sentences that were not well learned for 10-30 epochs, which results in a wastage of time. Here, we propose an efficient method to dynamically sample the sentences in order to accelerate the NMT training. In this approach, a weight is assigned to each sentence based on the measured difference between the training costs of two iterations. Further, in each epoch, a certain percentage of sentences are dynamically sampled according to their weights. Empirical results based on the NIST Chinese-to-English and the WMT English-to-German tasks show that the proposed method can significantly accelerate the NMT training and improve the NMT performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.11}, {"id": "111616", "output": "\"Computing Cutwidth and Optimal Linear Arrangement on Semicomplete Digraphs: Hardness and Efficient Algorithms\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Computing Cutwidth and Linear Arrangement on Digraphs\", \"Computing Cutwidth and Optimal Arrangement on Semicomplete Digraphs\"]\n</similarpairs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our techniques also can be used to analyze the sizes of minimal obstructions for having a small cutwidth under the induced subdigraph relation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111617", "output": "Improving Anonymization Effectiveness through Generalization Semantic Loss: A Priori Evaluation of Value Generalization Hierarchies for Enhanced Data Utility and Privacy Preservation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, due to the possible content of sensitive information, this data must be anonymized. A commonly-used technique to anonymize data is generalization. Nevertheless, its effectiveness can be hampered by the Value Generalization Hierarchies (VGHs) used as poorly-specified VGHs can decrease the usefulness of the resulting data. To tackle this problem, in our previous work we presented the Generalization Semantic Loss (GSL), a metric that captures the quality of categorical VGHs in terms of semantic consistency and taxonomic organization. We validated the accuracy of GSL using an intrinsic evaluation with respect to a gold standard ontology. In this paper, we extend our previous work by conducting an extrinsic evaluation of GSL with respect to the performance that VGHs have in anonymization (using data utility metrics). We show how GSL can be used to perform an a priori assessment of the VGHs' effectiveness for anonymization. In this manner, data publishers can quantitatively compare the quality of various VGHs and identify (before anonymization) those that better retain the semantics of the original data. Consequently, the utility of the anonymized datasets can be improved without sacrificing the privacy goal. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of GSL, as the quality of VGHs measured with GSL strongly correlates with the utility of the anonymized data. Results also show the benefits that an a priori VGH assessment strategy brings to the anonymization process in terms of time-savings and a reduction in the dependency on expert knowledge. Finally, GSL also proved to be lightweight in terms of computational resources.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "111618", "output": "Distributed Rendering for Immersive Virtual Environments: A Scalable Solution for Multi-Display Workstations", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Furthermore immersive visualization can exploit multiple displays fostering the needing of computational power. We hereby present a system, called XVR Network Renderer, allowing rendering load to be distributed throughout a cluster of workstations operating concurrently. The proposed solution consists in a set of software modules structured as a single-master multiple-slaves architecture. The master software intercepts all the graphical commands performed by an OpenGL application, without any modification of the source code. The commands are then streamed and executed individually by each slave client. The Network Renderer can be seen as a virtual OpenGL context with high capabilities. The system can be configured to work with a wide range of complex visualization setups, like CAVEs, automatically handling stereoscopy, performing perspective corrections and managing projection-related common problems. Any number of displays can be simultaneously managed by the cluster.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111619", "output": "\"Efficient Mining of Weighted Frequent Sequences in Uncertain Databases: A Framework for Pruning and Upper Bound Estimation\"\n\nor \n\n\"Weighted Sequence Mining in Uncertain Databases: Development of a Novel Framework and Evaluation on Real-World Datasets\"\n\nor \n\n\"Pruning and Estimation of", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In applications one often needs to quickly tell if an input matrix is PSD, and a small distance from the PSD cone may be tolerable. We consider two well-studied query models for measuring efficiency, namely, the matrix-vector and vector-matrix-vector query models. We first consider one-sided testers, which are testers that correctly classify any PSD input, but may fail on a non-PSD input with a tiny failure probability. Up to logarithmic factors, in the matrix-vector query model we show a tight $\\tilde{\\Theta}(1/\\epsilon^{p/(2p+1)})$ bound, while in the vector-matrix-vector query model we show a tight $\\tilde{\\Theta}(d^{1-1/p}/\\epsilon)$ bound, for every $p\\geq 1$. We also show a strong separation between one-sided and two-sided testers in the vector-matrix-vector model, where a two-sided tester can fail on both PSD and non-PSD inputs with a tiny failure probability. In particular, for the important case of the Frobenius norm, we show that any one-sided tester requires $\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon)$ queries. However we introduce a bilinear sketch for two-sided testing from which we construct a Frobenius norm tester achieving the optimal $\\tilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^{2})$ queries. We also give a number of additional separations between adaptive and non-adaptive testers. Our techniques have implications beyond testing, providing new methods to approximate the spectrum of a matrix with Frobenius norm error using dimensionality reduction in a way that preserves the signs of eigenvalues.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "111621", "output": "Based on the provided features, I can generate a suitable title for the abstract.

This is a very interesting, important and challenging topic due to its usefulness in medical diagnosis. This study proposes a robust framework using a sampling technique and extreme gradient boosting (FSX) to improve the prediction performance for the SCADI dataset. The proposed framework first converts the original dataset to a new dataset with a smaller number of dimensions. Then, our proposed framework balances the new dataset in the previous step using oversampling techniques with different ratios. Next, extreme gradient boosting was used to diagnose the problems. The experiments in terms of prediction performance and feature importance were conducted to show the effectiveness of FSX as well as to analyse the results. The experimental results show that FSX that uses the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for the oversampling module outperforms the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) -based approach, Support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest for the SCADI dataset. The overall accuracy of the proposed framework reaches 85.4%, a pretty high performance, which can be used for self-care problem classification in medical diagnosis.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111622", "output": "\"Dynamic Optimization with Adaptive Scheduling: A Novel Framework for Multi-Population Algorithms\"\n\nor\n\n\"Scheduling for Enhanced Performance in Multi-Population Methods for Dynamic Optimization Problems\"\n\nor\n\n\"Improving Multi-Population Algorithms for Dynamic Optimization through Adaptive Scheduling and Feedback Control\"\n\nor\n\n\"Adaptive Scheduling", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The fundamental idea of the proposed framework is to incorporate the concept of scheduling into multi-population methods with the aim to allocate more function evaluations to the best performing sub-populations. Two methods are developed based on the proposed framework, each of which uses a different approach for scheduling the sub-populations. The first method combines the quality of sub-populations and the degree of diversity among them into a single feedback parameter for detecting the best performing sub-population. The second method uses the learning automata as the central unit for performing the scheduling operation. In order to validate the applicability of the proposed methods, they are incorporated into three well-known algorithms for DOPs. The experimental results show the efficiency of the scheduling approach for improving the multi-population methods on the moving peaks benchmark (MPB) and generalized dynamic benchmark generator.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111623", "output": "Contextual Estimation of Continuous State Variables from Discrete Context-Based Measurements\n\nor\n\nContinuous State Estimation via Contextual Information from Discrete Measurements\n\nor\n\nDiscrete Context-Based Measurements for Continuous State Estimation\n\nor \n\nContextual Discrete Measurements for Continuous State Estimation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In current analytic engines, machine learning functions are modeled as user-defined functions (UDFs) which are both time and resource intensive. These UDFs prevent predicate pushdown; predicates that use the outputs of these UDFs cannot be pushed to before the UDFs. Hence, considerable time and resources are wasted in applying the UDFs on inputs that will be rejected by the subsequent predicate. We uses PPs that are lightweight classifiers applied directly on the raw input and filter data blobs that disagree with the query predicate. By reducing the input to be processed by the UDFs, PPs substantially improve query processing. We will show that PPs are broadly applicable by constructing PPs for many inference tasks including image recognition, document classification and video analyses. We will also demonstrate query optimization methods that extend PPs to complex query predicates and support different accuracy requirements.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111627", "output": "Analytical Solutions of Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations Using the Volterra Transformation and Boundary Control Scheme", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The lessons learned from the past DDoS mitigation designs indicate that the heavy reliance on additional software modules and dedicated hardware devices seriously impede their widespread deployment. This paper proposes an autonomic DDoS defense framework, called ArOMA, that leverages the programmability and centralized manageability features of Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. Specifically, ArOMA can systematically bridge the gaps between different security functions, ranging from traffic monitoring to anomaly detection to mitigation, while sparing human operators from non-trivial interventions. It also facilitates the collaborations between ISPs and their customers on DDoS mitigation by logically distributing the essential security functions, allowing the ISP to handle DDoS traffic based on the requests of its customers. Our experimental results demonstrate that, in the face of DDoS flooding attacks, ArOMA can effectively maintain the performance of video streams at a satisfactory level.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "111629", "output": "\"Empathizing App Design: In-Situ Evaluation of Usability for Impaired Users through Immersive VR-Smartphone Interaction\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We propose Empath-D, a system that fosters empathetic design, by allowing app designers, in-situ, to rapidly evaluate the usability of their apps, from the perspective of impaired users. To provide a truly authentic experience, Empath-D carefully orchestrates the interaction between a smartphone and a VR device, allowing the user to experience simulated impairments in a virtual world while interacting naturally with the app, using a real smartphone. By carefully orchestrating the VR-smartphone interaction, Empath-D tackles challenges such as preserving low-latency app interaction, accurate visualization of hand movement and low-overhead perturbation of I/O streams. Experimental results show that user interaction with Empath-D is comparable (both in accuracy and user perception) to real-world app usage, and that it can simulate impairment effects as effectively as a custom hardware simulator.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111630", "output": "Secure Data Deletion for Embedded Devices: A Novel Vacuum Approach\n\nor\n\n Secure Data Deletion for Embedded Devices: A Novel Secure File Deletion Method\n\nor\n\n Secure Data Deletion for Embedded Devices: A Novel Method for Irreversible Data Erasure\n\nor\n\n Secure Data Deletion for Embedded Devices: A Novel", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this article, we study the logic structure, operation characteristics, and data management mechanisms of flash memory. Then, we propose a novel method Vacuum that uses a user-space file system and can provide fine-grained file deletion guarantees. Our approach encrypts files on an insecure medium with a unique key that can later be discarded to cryptographically render the data irrecoverable. Additionally, we use TrustZone as a secure key vault, and a garbage collection mechanism is introduced to purge the memory. Finally, we carried out experiments on the Android system, and the results showed that the solution is efficient and can meet the needs of real applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111631", "output": "Fault-Tolerant Wireless Sensor Networks: A Multi-Agent Approach to Energy-Efficient Services", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The reliability and availability of WSNs can be affected by faults, including those from radio interference, battery exhaustion, hardware and software failures, communication link errors, malicious attacks, and so on. Thus, we propose a novel multi-agent fault tolerant system for wireless sensor networks. Since a major requirement of WSNs is to reduce energy consumption, we use multi-agent and mobile agent configurations to manage WSNs that provide energy-efficient services. Mobile agent architecture have inherent advantages in that they provide energy awareness, scalability, reliability, and extensibility. Our multi-agent system consists of a resource manager, a fault tolerance manager and a load balancing manager, and we also propose fault-tolerant protocols that use multi-agent and mobile agent setups.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111632", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\nUsing the similar abstract-title pairs from my past works:\n\n1. \"Reinventing the Wheel: A Novel Approach to Escaping Plateaus in Local Search Algorithms for MAXSAT\"\n2. \"Breaking the Plateau: A Genetic Recombination", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This second problem may be related to local search's inability to exploit problem structure. We propose a genetic recombination operator to address both of these issues. On problems with well defined local optima, partition crossover is able to \"tunnel\" between local optima to discover new local optima in O(n) time. The PXSAT algorithm combines partition crossover and local search to produce a new way to escape plateaus. Partition crossover locally decomposes the evaluation function for a given instance into independent components, and is guaranteed to find the best solution among an exponential number of candidate solutions in O(n) time. Empirical results on an extensive set of application instances show that the proposed framework substantially improves two of best local search solvers, AdaptG2WSAT and Sparrow, on many application instances. PXSAT combined with AdaptG2WSAT is also able to outperform CCLS, winner of several recent MAXSAT competitions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111633", "output": "Based on the provided features, I'll generate a title for the abstract.

The DE/current-to-pbest is introduced to increase the population diversity while remaining its elitist learning behavior in this architecture. The multi-stage perturbation-based mutation operation utilizes the Normal random distribution with adjustable variance to perturb the chosen solutions. Multiple parameters are adaptively adjusted to appropriate values to match the current search status of algorithm. It is thus helpful to enhance the performance and the robustness of algorithm.

Different from existing policy gradient methods which employ single actor critic but cannot realize satisfactory tracking control accuracy and stable learning, our proposed algorithm can achieve high-level tracking control accuracy of AUVs and stable learning by applying a hybrid actors-critics architecture, where multiple actors and critics are trained to learn a deterministic policy and action-value function, respectively. Specifically, for the critics, the expected absolute Bellman error-based updating rule is used to choose the worst critic to be updated in each time step. Subsequently, to calculate the loss function with more accurate target value for the chosen critic, Pseudo Q-learning, which uses subgreedy policy to replace the greedy policy in Q-learning, is developed for continuous action spaces, and Multi Pseudo Q-learning (MPQ) is proposed to reduce the overestimation of action-value function and to stabilize the learning. As for the actors, deterministic policy gradient is applied to update the weights, and the final learned policy is defined as the average of all actors to avoid large but bad updates. Moreover, the stability analysis of the learning is given qualitatively. The effectiveness and generality of the proposed MPQ-based deterministic policy gradient (MPQ-DPG) algorithm are verified by the application on AUV with two different reference trajectories. In addition, the results demonstrate high-level tracking control accuracy and stable learning of MPQ-DPG. Besides, the results also validate that increasing the number of the actors and critics will further improve the performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111640", "output": "Stability and Dynamic Control of Underlay Mobile Edge Networks: A Benchmark and Joint Flow Control Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Identifying users in these two classes is important for abuse detection, user and content ranking, privacy choices, and other social network features. In this paper we develop SCRank, an iterative algorithm to identify such users. We analyze SCRank both theoretically and experimentally. The spammer-celebrity definition is not amenable to analysis using standard power iteration, so we develop a novel potential function argument to show convergence to an approximate equilibrium point for a class of algorithms including SCRank. We then use experimental evaluation on a real global-scale social network and on synthetically generated graphs to observe that the algorithm converges quickly and consistently. Using synthetic data with built-in ground truth, we also experimentally show that the algorithm provides a good approximation to planted celebrities and spammers.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111642", "output": "\"Tightening the Bounds on One-Counter Automata: A Tight Upper Bound on Shortest Path Lengths in One-Counter Transition Systems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We first learn motion representation from sharp videos in an unsupervised manner through training of a convolutional recurrent video autoencoder network that performs a surrogate task of video reconstruction. Once trained, it is employed for guided training of a motion encoder for blurred images. This network extracts embedded motion information from the blurred image to generate a sharp video in conjunction with the trained recurrent video decoder. As an intermediate step, we also design an efficient architecture that enables real-time single image deblurring and outperforms competing methods across all factors: accuracy, speed, and compactness. Experiments on real scenes and standard datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art and its ability to generate a plausible sequence of temporally consistent sharp frames.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111647", "output": "\"Hemispherical Quadrature Error Analysis and Optimal Sample Weights for Efficient Rendering\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We leverage recent work regarding the theory of quadrature rules over the sphere in order to derive a new theoretical framework for the general case of hemispherical quadrature error analysis. We then apply our framework to the case of the shading integral. We show that our quadrature error theory can be used to derive optimal sample weights (OSW) which account for both the features of the sampling pattern and the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Our method significantly outperforms familiar Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and stochastic Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the OSW are very effective in compensating for possible irregularities in the sample distribution. This allows, for example, to significantly exceed the regular O(N-1/2) convergence rate of stochastic Monte Carlo while keeping the exact same sample sets. Another important benefit of our method is that OSW can be applied whatever the sampling points distribution: the sample distribution need not follow a probability density function, which makes our technique much more flexible than QMC or stochastic Monte Carlo solutions. In particular, our theoretical framework allows to easily combine point sets derived from different sampling strategies (e.g. targeted to diffuse and glossy BRDF). In this context, our rendering results show that our approach overcomes MIS (Multiple Importance Sampling) techniques.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "111648", "output": "\"Enhanced Motion Adaptability in Single-Chip DLP Projectors for Dynamic Projection Mapping\"\n\nor \n\n\"Real-Time Projection Mapping with High-Speed Motion Adaptability via Single-Chip DLP Technology\"\n\nor \n\n\"High-FPS Motion Adaptability in 24-Bit Full-Color DLP Projectors for Dynamic Scene", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this work, we extend the vision of sustainable and comfortable adaptive buildings using interactive smart windows. We systematically explore the design space of interactive windows to chart requirements, constraints, and challenges. To that end, we built proof-of-concept prototypes of smart windows with fine-grained control of transparency. In two studies, we explored user attitudes towards interactive windows and elicited control methods. We found that users understand and see potential for interactive windows at home. We provide specific usage contexts and specify interactions that may facilitate domestic applications. Our work illustrates the concept of interactive smart windows and provides insights regarding their design, development, and user controls for adaptive walls. We identify design dimensions and challenges to stimulate further development in the domain of adaptive buildings.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.1}, {"id": "111651", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title.\n\n<similarpairs>\n1. \"Weighted Congestion Games with Polynomial Latency Functions: Existence and Efficiency of Approximate Pure Nash Equilibria\"\n2. \"Approximate Pure Nash Equilibria in Weighted Congestion Games with Polynomial Latency Functions", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For these games, we investigate the existence and efficiency of approximate pure Nash equilibria which are obtained through sequences of unilateral improvement moves by the players. By exploiting a simple technique, we firstly show that these games admit an infinite set of d-approximate potential functions. This implies that there always exists a d-approximate pure Nash equilibrium which can be reached through any sequence of d-approximate improvement moves by the players. As a corollary, we also obtain that, under mild assumptions on the structure of the players' strategies, these games also admit a constant approximate potential function. Secondly, using a simple potential function argument, we are able to show that a (d+\u03b4)-approximate pure Nash equilibrium of cost at most (d+1)/(d+\u03b4) times the cost of an optimal state always exists, for every \u03b4\u2208[0,1].\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111652", "output": "Distributed Optimization via Lazy Adam: A Federated Learning Framework for Reduced Communication Overhead and Improved Performance", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The federated average algorithm has been widely used for distributed optimization via training local models in parallel and aggregating local models in a server to obtain the global model. To further improve the performance of the federated average algorithm, a novel federated learning algorithm have been proposed in this article by embedding a lazy strategy in the distributed Adam-type algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the learning rate is adjusted adaptively in local update and lazy update strategy is applied on the second-order momentum of clients to make the learning rate identical. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is provided for both convex and nonconvex loss functions. Experiments have been conducted on MNIST digit recognition data set and CIFAR-10 data set. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the communication overhead, thereby reduce the training time by 60% for CIFAR-10 data set, and the proposed algorithm achieve better performance than the federated average algorithm and its momentum version.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111653", "output": "Alternative Frameworks for L-Fuzzy Mathematical Morphology: A Set-Theoretic Approach Based on Adjoint Triples and L-Fuzzy Relations", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In addition, we also present some new results concerning duality and transformation invariance. Concerning duality, we show that duality and adjointness can coexist in this L-fuzzy relational MM. Concerning transformation invariance, we show sufficient conditions to guarantee the invariance of morphological operators under arbitrary transformations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111654", "output": "Temporal Logic for Runtime Monitorability in Hennessy-Milner Logic with Recursion: An Expressiveness Hierarchy and Compositional Synthesis", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our work establishes an expressiveness hierarchy of monitorable fragments of Hennessy-Milner logic with recursion in a linear-time setting and exactly identifies what kinds of guarantees can be given using runtime monitors for each fragment in the hierarchy. Each fragment is shown to be complete, in the sense that it can express all properties that can be monitored under the corresponding guarantees. The study is carried out using a principled approach to monitoring that connects the semantics of the logic and the operational semantics of monitors. The proposed framework supports the automatic, compositional synthesis of correct monitors from monitorable properties.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111655", "output": "\"Advancing Compact MRI Coil Arrays: A Fully Integrated Dual-Receiver RFIC for Ultra-High Field Scanners\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It employs a strong static magnetic field (1.5 to 10.5T for human imaging) to split the spin states of the  1 H nuclei in the body, and RF excitation to induce transitions and coherence among them. Gradient fields are superimposed to modulate the  1 H resonance frequency, which enables spatially distinguishable signals to be picked up by RF receive coils. A high-field MRI provides better sensitivity and resolution but requires better receivers (RX), as signal DR and  1 H resonance increase (128MHz for 3T, 300MHz for 7T). Overall sensitivity and imaging speed can be enhanced by closely surrounding the target anatomy with tens of RX coils (as in MIMO) [1], at the expense of as many shielded RF cables to carry the information out of the field. Progress in PCB size has allowed multi-channel RX to be placed inside the magnetic field (in-bore), reducing the RF cable length to less than 1m [2,3]. Ultimately, the RX should be placed directly on-coil to avoid bulky coaxial cables and improve patient comfort and safety by acquiring data in-bore and sending them digitally to the MRI scanner via an optical fiber link. The latter is cheap, flexible and insensitive to magnetic fields. The immediate vicinity of the coils and the patient is, however, a hostile as well as sensitive electromagnetic environment, which tolerates only the smallest of PCBs and virtually no magnetic material in its components. Integration of the full RX chain in a CMOS chip, which is small, non-magnetic and low power, holds the key to the next wave of compact MRI coil arrays for advanced medical imaging. This paper presents a fully integrated dual-receiver RFIC for coil arrays intended for (ultra-) high field (1.5 to 10.5T and 64 to 450MHz) scanners for clinical MRI, where requirements are considerably stricter than previously reported transceiver ICs [4,5] on palm-held NMR devices for spectroscopy or lab-on-chip applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111656", "output": "\"CloudCrowd: A Crowdsourced Resource Sharing Model for Efficient Energy Consumption Reduction in Cloud Computing\"\n\nor\n\n\"Resource Sharing through Crowdfunding: A Novel Approach to Optimize Energy Consumption in Cloud Service Providers\"\n\nor\n\n\"Crowdsourced Resource Allocation for Energy-Efficient Cloud Computing: A Repeated Game Mechan", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, in the open sharing mobile Internet, many devices are idle in the network, and a large amount of resource is wasted. This study proposes a new model based on the idea of crowdfunding, which can be a supplement to the traditional resource supply mode. With this model, users can contribute their spare resource to cloud service providers to perform cloud tasks and receive preferential pricing when they require resource. A reward and punishment mechanism is designed based on the repeated game to encourage users to contribute their spare resource and to monitor the cloud service provider to ensure that supporters can receive a preferential price in return. MATLAB simulation results show that the new model reduces the overall energy consumption, and the incentive mechanism is available to motivate supporters to actively perform cloud tasks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111657", "output": "\"Overcoming Hidden Channel Interference in 802.11ac Networks via Post-CCA Based Bandwidth Adaptation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the heterogeneity of bandwidth in a network can cause asymmetric interferences in which certain transmissions cannot be sensed by some other nodes. As a result, the conventional Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) may not work well in 802.11ac networks. We call this the Hidden Channel (HC) problem, which is shown to be real via experiments with USRP and WARP boards. To solve this problem, we propose bandwidth adaptation based on post-CCA, which is a clear channel assessment (CCA) procedure performed aftercompleting a transmission. Post-CCA in wireless networks helps mimic the CSMA with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) mechanism in the wired Ethernet, thus enhancing channel assessment capability. Using post-CCA, we propose Post-CCA based Bandwidth Adaptation (PoBA) that alters bandwidth and channel configuration dynamically by applying a reinforcement learning mechanism. Post-CCA and PoBA do not require any hardware modification and are also compliant with the 802.11 standards. PoBA is shown via simulation to increase network-wide throughput, channel utilization and fairness, and also lower packet error probability.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111658", "output": "Plane Detection from Monocular Image Sequences via Iso-Velocity Curves and c-Velocity Representation\n\n<similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Within a framework of driver assistance applications, it is assumed that the 3D scene is a set of 3D planes. In this paper, the vision process considers obstacles, roads and buildings as planar structures. These planes are detected by exploiting iso-velocity curves after optical flow estimation. A Hough Transform-like frame called c-velocity was designed. This paper explains how this c-velocity, defined by analogy to the v-disparity in stereovision, can represent planes, regardless of their orientation and how this representation facilitates plane extraction. Under a translational camera motion, planar surfaces are transformed into specific parabolas of the c-velocity space.

However, current practices of prefabrication transportation are inefficient due to various involved stakeholders, outdated decision support tools, scarce real-time data, and ineffective information sharing mechanisms. To tackle these problems, and facilitate the management and operations of prefabrication transportation, this paper proposes a cloud-based fleet management platform through integrating the advantages of Internet of Things (iot) and cloud technology. A Transportation Management Service Sharing (TMSS) mechanism is proposed, which enables the platform to be easily and economically used by various transportation service providers, and could benefit all the other stakeholders involved. Besides, relation-based data extraction approach is proposed to extract sufficient transportation data during the whole process, and the transportation data synchronization mechanism is also worked out to ensure the data consistency. Finally, based on a real-life prefabricated construction project for public housing production in Hong Kong, a case study is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed platform.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "111661", "output": "Stability and Synchronization of Discrete-Time Delayed Neural Networks with Discontinuous Activations: Existence, Uniqueness, and Control", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, such techniques often fail to take advantage of the user's own expertise about the problem domain. This work provides visual interactive support to assist users in solving the scenario reduction problem with time-series data. We employ a series of time-based visualization techniques linked together to perform the task. By adapting a multidimensional projection algorithm to handle temporal data, we can graphically present the evolution of the ensemble. We also propose to use cumulative bump charts to visually compare the ranks of distances between the ensemble time series and a baseline series. To evaluate our approach, we developed a prototype application and conducted observation studies with volunteer users of varying backgrounds and levels of expertise. Our results indicate that a graphical approach to scenario reduction may result in a good subset of scenarios and provides a valuable tool for data exploration in this context. The users liked the interaction mechanisms provided and judged the task to be easy to perform with the tools provided.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "111663", "output": "\"Empowering Users: A Transformative Approach to Deriving UX Requirements for Patient-Centric Information Systems\"\n\nor alternatively \n\n\"From Context to Action: Extending User-Centered Design to Support Personal Empowerment in Healthcare Information Systems\"\n\nor \n\n\"Patient-Centered Requirements Engineering: A Novel Methodology for Informing the", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

An implication graph with fault nodes is termed functional fault graph (FFG) because such a graph stores both the functional information and the fault information of the circuit. By computing the transitive closure and graph condensation of the FFG of a circuit, we show that we can collapse faults, and identify untestable faults and independent fault pairs in the circuit. Compared to prior fault independent-based approaches for fault collapsing, our technique gives the best result by reducing the fault-set size by 66%. Additional advantages of our technique compared to previous techniques are: a) It can also identify independent fault pairs in the circuit, and b) It can be extended for other fault models and has a variety of applications. Our experiment with c7552 also found more than 268 K independent fault pairs. This work also introduces the first fault-independent polynomial-time approach for identifying untestable transition delay faults.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111665", "output": "\"Automated GUI Test Script Repair via Computer Vision-based GUI Change Detection\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Manual test cases, containing valuable human knowledge about the apps under test, are often coded as scripts to enable automated and repeated execution for test cost reduction. Unfortunately, many test scripts may become broken due to changes made during app updates. Broken test scripts are expected to be updated for reuse; however, the maintenance cost can be high if large numbers of test scripts require manual repair. We propose an approach named Meter to repairing broken test scripts automatically when mobile apps are updated. Meter novelly leverages computer vision techniques to infer GUI changes between two versions from screenshots and uses the GUI changes to guide the repair of test scripts. In experiments conducted on 18 Android apps, METER was able to repair 78.3% broken test scripts.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.33}, {"id": "111666", "output": "Calibration of Attention-Based Neural Machine Translation Systems: A Study on the Miscalibration of End of Sequence Markers and Attention Uncertainty", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For structured outputs like in NMT, calibration is important not just for reliable confidence with predictions, but also for proper functioning of beam-search inference. We show that most modern NMT models are surprisingly miscalibrated even when conditioned on the true previous tokens. Our investigation leads to two main reasons -- severe miscalibration of EOS (end of sequence marker) and suppression of attention uncertainty. We design recalibration methods based on these signals and demonstrate improved accuracy, better sequence-level calibration, and more intuitive results from beam-search.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111667", "output": "Hierarchical Model Fitting Histograms: A Novel Approach for Selectivity Estimation and Approximate Query Answering\n\n<similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper presents a new family of histograms, the Hierarchical Model Fitting (HMF) histograms, based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Rather than having each bucket of a histogram described by the same type of model, the HMF histograms employ a local optimal model for each bucket. The improved effectiveness of the locally chosen models offsets more than the overhead of keeping track of the representation of each individual bucket. Through a set of experiments, we show that the HMF histograms are capable of providing more accurate approximations than previously proposed techniques for many real and synthetic data sets across a variety of query workloads.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.65}, {"id": "111668", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Pole Detection in Urban Environments\", \"Object Classification from Point Clouds\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n[\"Use of clustering algorithms\", \"Application of region growing algorithms\", \"Use of SVM for classification\"]\n</", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To achieve our goal, we propose a system consisting of three stages: localization, segmentation and classification. The localization algorithm based on slicing, clustering, pole seed generation and bucket augmentation takes advantage of the unique characteristics of pole-like objects and avoids heavy computation on the feature of every point in traditional methods. Then, the bucket-shaped neighborhood of the segments is integrated and trimmed with region growing algorithms, reducing the noises within candidate's neighborhood. Finally, we introduce a representation of six attributes based on the height and five point classes closely related to the pole categories and apply SVM to classify the candidate objects into 4 categories, including 3 pole categories light, utility pole and sign, and the non-pole category. The performance of our method is demonstrated through comparison with previous works on a large-scale urban dataset.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111669", "output": "\"A Constructive Framework for Structural Analysis of Multi-Mode Differential Algebraic Equation Systems\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"A Constructive Approach to the Analysis of Differential Algebraic Equations\", \"Constructive Semantics for Nonstandard Analysis of DAE Systems\"]\n\n<features>\n[\"Use of technical terms: 'constructive semantics',", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Unlike ODEs, they exhibit subtle issues because of their implicit latent equations and related differentiation index. Multi-mode DAE (mDAE) systems are much harder to deal with, not only because of their mode-dependent dynamics, but essentially because of the events and resets occurring at mode transitions. Unfortunately, the large literature devoted to the numerical analysis of DAEs does not cover the multi-mode case. It typically says nothing about mode changes. This lack of foundations cause numerous difficulties to the existing modeling tools. Some models are well handled, others are not, with no clear boundary between the two classes. In this paper we develop a comprehensive mathematical approach to the structural analysis of mDAE systems which properly extends the usual analysis of DAE systems. We define a constructive semantics based on nonstandard analysis and show how to produce execution schemes in a systematic way.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111670", "output": "\"Root Cause Analysis in PaaS Clouds: A Platform-Agnostic Approach to Performance Anomaly Detection\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Today, SSDs are essentially a block device attached to a legacy host interface. As a result, the system I/O bus remains a bottleneck, and the abundant flash memory bandwidth and the computing capabilities of SSD are largely untapped. In this paper, we propose to accelerate key database operations, scan and join, for large-scale data analysis by moving data-intensive processing from the host CPU to inside flash SSDs (\\\"in-storage processing\\\"), close to the data source itself. To realize the idea of in-storage processing in a cost-effective manner, we deploy special-purpose compute modules using the System-on-Chip technology. While data from flash memory are transferred, a target database operation is applied to the data stream on the fly without any delay. This reduces the amount of data to transfer to the host drastically, and in turn, ensures all components along the data path in an SSD are utilized in a balanced way. Our experimental results show that in-storage processing outperforms conventional processing with a host CPU by over up to 7 \u00d7, 5 \u00d7 and 47 \u00d7 for scan, join, and their combination, respectively. It also turns out that in-storage processing can be realized at only 1% of the total SSD cost, while offering sizable energy savings of up to 45 \u00d7 compared to host processing.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111673", "output": "\"Time-Based Receiver with 2-Tap Decision Feedback Equalizer for Mobile DRAM Interface\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Most of current state-of-the-art focus on constructing powerful deep models to obtain better deraining results. In this paper, to further improve the deraining performance, we novelly attempt to handle the SIRR task from the perspective of training datasets by exploring a more efficient way to synthesize rainy images. Specifically, we build a full Bayesian generative model for rainy image where the rain layer is parameterized as a generator with the input as some latent variables representing the physical structural rain factors, e.g., direction, scale, and thickness. To solve this model, we employ the variational inference framework to approximate the expected statistical distribution of rainy image in a data-driven manner. With the learned generator, we can automatically and sufficiently generate diverse and non-repetitive training pairs so as to efficiently enrich and augment the existing benchmark datasets. User study qualitatively and quantitatively evaluates the realism of generated rainy images. Comprehensive experiments substantiate that the proposed model can faithfully extract the complex rain distribution that not only helps significantly improve the deraining performance of current deep single image derainers, but also largely loosens the requirement of large training sample pre-collection for the SIRR task.

However, recent works have demonstrated that sharing model updates makes FL vulnerable to inference attack. In this work, we show our key observation that the data representation leakage from gradients is the essential cause of privacy leakage in FL. We also provide an analysis of this observation to explain how the data presentation is leaked. Based on this observation, we propose a defense called Soteria against model inversion attack in FL. The key idea of our defense is learning to perturb data representation such that the quality of the reconstructed data is severely degraded, while FL performance is maintained. In addition, we derive a certified robustness guarantee to FL and a convergence guarantee to FedAvg, after applying our defense. To evaluate our defense, we conduct experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 for defending against the DLG attack and GS attack. Without sacrificing accuracy, the results demonstrate that our proposed defense can increase the mean squared error between the reconstructed data and the raw data by as much as 160x for both DLG attack and GS attack, compared with baseline defense methods. Therefore, the privacy of the FL system is significantly improved.

SystemJ uses the Java programming language as the \u201chost\u201d language, for carrying out data computations, because Java provides clearly defined operational semantics, type and memory safety in the form of the Garbage Collector(GC), which help with formal functional verification. The same GC, which helps in functional verification, makes Worst Case Reaction Time (WCRT)11Similar to Worst Case Execution Time. analysis challenging. Any WCRT analysis framework for GALS programs needs to consider the operations performed by the host language. It has been shown that the worst case time estimates for garbage collection cycles are in seconds, whereas the program\u2019s WCRT itself is in micro-seconds. These pessimistic estimates render the WCRT analysis framework ineffective. In order to overcome this problem, we develop a compiler assisted memory management technique for applications written in SystemJ. The SystemJ MoC plays the central role in the proposed technique. The SystemJ MoC allows clearly demarcating the state boundaries of the program, which in turn allows us to partition the heap, at compile time, into two distinct areas: (1) the memory area called the permanent heap, which holds objects that are alive throughout the life time of the application, and (2) the memory area used to hold all other objects, called the transient heap. The size of these memory areas are bounded statically. Furthermore, the memory allocation and reclaim procedures are simple load and pointer reset operations, respectively, which are guaranteed to complete within a bounded number of clock-cycles, thereby alleviating the need for large pessimistic WCRT bounds obtained due to the GC. Experimental results also show that the proposed approach is approximately three times faster, in terms of memory allocation times as compared to standard real-time GC approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "111678", "output": "\"Framework for Coherent Influence Ranking in Strategic Business Process Outsourcing: A Novel Weight Learning Algorithm\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

By leveraging the dependency between image class label and tags, we introduce a multi-layer group sparse structure of the reconstruction coefficients. Such structure fully encodes the mutual dependency between the class label, which describes image content as a whole, and tags, which describe the components of the image content. Therefore we propose a multi-layer group based tag propagation method, which combines the class label and subgroups of instances with similar tag distribution to annotate test images. To make our model more suitable for nonlinear separable features, we also extend our multi-layer group sparse coding in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which further improves performances of image classification and annotation. Moreover, we also integrate our multi-layer group sparse coding with $k{\\rm NN}$ strategy, which greatly improves the computational efficiency. Experimental results on the LabelMe, UIUC-Sports and NUS-WIDE-Object databases show that our method outperforms the baseline methods, and achieves excellent performances in both image classification and annotation tasks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111680", "output": "\"Learning from Artificially Seeded Bugs: A Deep Learning Approach to Name-Based Bug Detection\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, most existing bug detection tools ignore this information and therefore miss some classes of bugs. The few existing name-based bug detection approaches reason about names on a syntactic level and rely on manually designed and tuned algorithms to detect bugs. This paper presents DeepBugs, a learning approach to name-based bug detection, which reasons about names based on a semantic representation and which automatically learns bug detectors instead of manually writing them. We formulate bug detection as a binary classification problem and train a classifier that distinguishes correct from incorrect code. To address the challenge that effectively learning a bug detector requires examples of both correct and incorrect code, we create likely incorrect code examples from an existing corpus of code through simple code transformations. A novel insight learned from our work is that learning from artificially seeded bugs yields bug detectors that are effective at finding bugs in real-world code. We implement our idea into a framework for learning-based and name-based bug detection. Three bug detectors built on top of the framework detect accidentally swapped function arguments, incorrect binary operators, and incorrect operands in binary operations. Applying the approach to a corpus of 150,000 JavaScript files yields bug detectors that have a high accuracy (between 89% and 95%), are very efficient (less than 20 milliseconds per analyzed file), and reveal 102 programming mistakes (with 68% true positive rate) in real-world code.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111681", "output": "\"Rateless Coding for Efficient Multi-Overlay Live Video Streaming in P2P MMOs: A Dynamic Tree Construction Approach\"\n\nor \n\"Minimizing Transmission Rate while Maximizing Peer Served in Multi-Level Multi-Overlay Hybrid P2P Live Video Systems\"\n\nor \n\"Real-Time Multi-Player Live Video Streaming", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Constructing this abstraction for the entire system is computationally expensive, and does not exploit natural decompositions of many systems into interacting components. We describe a methodology for compositional symbolic abstraction to help scale controller synthesis for temporal logic to larger systems. We introduce \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">disturbance bisimulation</italic>\n, which strengthens the standard approximate alternating bisimulation relation used in control. It extends naturally to systems that are composed of weakly interconnected subcomponents, possibly connected in feedback, and models the coupling signals as disturbances. We show how networks of incrementally input-to-state stable, nonlinear, continuous-time control systems can be abstracted compositionally, so that all local abstractions are simultaneously disturbance bisimilar to their continuous counterparts. Furthermore, our construction ensures that the final composed abstraction is disturbance bisimilar to the original system. Finally, we discuss how we get a compositional abstraction-based controller-synthesis methodology for networks of such systems against local temporal specifications as a byproduct of our construction.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111684", "output": "\"Decision Network Approach to Critical Infrastructure Resilience: A Probabilistic Analysis of Attack and Defense Scenarios\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To bring these paradigms to life, self-sustainable wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes capable of seamless and maintenance free operation at remote locations are desired. Recently, radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) circuits capable of harvesting RF power transmitted by base stations, TV towers and other ambient RF sources have been developed. Low power requirements and architectural compatibility between WSN nodes and RFEH circuits make RFEH a promising and feasible solution for WSN nodes. In this paper, a novel multi-stage decision-making policy (DMP) for RFEH enabled WSN nodes has been proposed. It offers an intelligence, via online learning algorithm, for characterization and selection of frequency bands based on their RF potential especially in the dynamic spectrum environment. Furthermore, proposed DMP supports multi-antenna multi-band harvesting capabilities of the RFEH circuits. The final contribution includes tunable RFEH duration that leads to significant improvement in the harvested energy and fewer number of frequency band switchings (FBS). Derived theoretical performance bounds and simulation results validate the superiority of proposed DMP in terms of the harvested RF energy and throughput of the WSN nodes. Furthermore, the fewer number of FBS makes the proposed DMP suitable for resource-constrained WSN nodes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111686", "output": "Distributed Optimization of User Association in Heterogeneous Networks: Overcoming Local Optima and Solution Quality Trade-offs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Therefore, as one of the important sources for technological progress, technological knowledge flow\u00a0(TKF) forecasting, i.e., predicting the directional flows of knowledge from one technological field to another, has become a hot issue of widespread concern. However, existing researches either rely on labor-intensive empirical analysis or ignore the intrinsic characteristics inherent in TKF. To this end, we present a data-driven solution in this article, namely a hierarchical interactive multi-channel graph neural network\u00a0(HIMTKF). Specifically, HIMTKF generates final predictions using two types of vector representations for each technology node\u00a0(a diffusion vector and an absorption vector), which is realized by four components: high-order interaction module\u00a0(HOI), co-occurrence module\u00a0(CO), improved hierarchical delivery module\u00a0(IHD) and technological knowledge flow tracing module\u00a0(TFT). For one thing, HOI and CO are designed to represent high-order network relationships and co-occurrence relationships between technologies on the same hierarchy level. For another, IHD is aimed to model the hierarchical relationships between technologies while also taking their personalities into account. Then, TFT is intended for capturing the dynamic feature evolution of technologies with the above relations involved. Additionally, we develop a hybrid loss function and propose a new evaluation metric for better forecasting the unprecedented knowledge flows between technologies. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a large dataset of real-world patents. The results validate the effectiveness of our approach and shed light on several intriguing phenomena about technological knowledge flow trends.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111688", "output": "\"Unlocking the Potential of Big Data in Healthcare: Enabling the Learning Healthcare System Cycle\"\n\nor \n\"Big Data in Healthcare: A Synergistic Approach for Clinical Decision-Making and Biomedical Research\"\n\nor \n\"Data-Driven Healthcare: Harnessing the Power of Big Data for Integrated Clinical Decision-Making and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In addition, the power of primal-dual mesh pairs, exemplified by Voronoi-Delaunay meshes, has been recognized as an important ingredient in numerous formulations. The VoroCrust algorithm is the first provably correct algorithm for conforming polyhedral Voronoi meshing for non-convex and non-manifold domains with guarantees on the quality of both surface and volume elements. A robust refinement process estimates a suitable sizing field that enables the careful placement of Voronoi seeds across the surface, circumventing the need for clipping and avoiding its many drawbacks. The algorithm has the flexibility of filling the interior by either structured or random samples while preserving all sharp features in the output mesh. We demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm on a variety of models and compare against state-of-the-art polyhedral meshing methods based on clipped Voronoi cells establishing the clear advantage of VoroCrust output.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "111690", "output": "\"Information Propagation in Deep Neural Networks: Theoretical Insights into Activation Function and Initialization Strategies\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

An inappropriate selection can lead to the loss of information of the input during forward propagation and the exponential vanishing/exploding of gradients during back-propagation. Understanding the theoretical properties of untrained random networks is key to identifying which deep networks may be trained successfully as recently demonstrated by Schoenholz et al. (2017) who showed that for deep feedforward neural networks only a specific choice of hyperparameters known as the `edge of chaosu0027 can lead to good performance. We complete this analysis by providing quantitative results showing that, for a class of ReLU-like activation functions, the information propagates indeed deeper for an initialization at the edge of chaos. By further extending this analysis, we identify a class of activation functions that improve the information propagation over ReLU-like functions. This class includes the Swish activation, $phi_{swish}(x) = x cdot text{sigmoid}(x)$, used in Hendrycks u0026 Gimpel (2016), Elfwing et al. (2017) and Ramachandran et al. (2017). This provides a theoretical grounding for the excellent empirical performance of $phi_{swish}$ observed in these contributions. We complement those previous results by illustrating the benefit of using a random initialization on the edge of chaos in this context.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111691", "output": "Based on the provided abstract and features, I will generate a title for the abstract.

Our ECS implements a novel request handling procedure that ensures a firstly received write request is firstly multi-casted, notified, and updated, so thus our DisCon can maximally ensure the same time sequence in which topology events get updated at different controllers and the constructed topologies can reflect the real network change in practice. We highlight the major mechanisms used, discuss the major causes of this eventual consistency, estimate the inconsistency window among controllers, and show how this eventual consistency does not make a big difference in supporting network applications. Experiments are conducted to evaluate our ECS and DisCon. The results show our DisCon has a larger event replay throughput and a lower event converging delay than HyperFlow, and larger flow setup rate and lower flow setup delay than most of the current distributed control planes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.04}, {"id": "111692", "output": "\"Sequential Estimation of Extreme Quantiles with Reduced Bias and Improved Precision\"\n\nor \n\n\"Batching and Sectioning for Enhanced Estimation of Extreme Quantiles in Simulation Output\"\n\nor \n\n\"Maximum Transformation and Sectioning for Efficient Computation of Extreme Quantile Estimators\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The method is an enhancement of the Sequest procedure proposed by Alexopoulos et al. in 2014 for estimating nonextreme steady-state quantiles. Sequem exploits a combination of batching, sectioning, and the maximum transformation technique to achieve the following: (a) reduction in point-estimator bias arising from initial conditions or inadequate simulation run length; and (b) adjustment of the CI half-length to compensate for the effects of skewness or correlation in the corresponding quantile point estimators obtained from nonoverlapping batches. The CIs delivered by Sequem satisfy user-specified requirements related to coverage probability and absolute or relative precision. A preliminary evaluation based on three \\\"stress-testing\\\" processes revealed that Sequem exhibited good performance when used in challenging settings.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.0}, {"id": "111693", "output": "\"Slice Finder: An Interactive Framework for Identifying Large, Interpretable Slices in Model Validation\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Slice Finder\", \"Model Validator\"]\n[\"Data Slicer\", \"Model Performance Analyzer\"]\n[\"Slice Identification\", \"Model Debugging Tool\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n[uses phrases \"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, current data tools are still primitive when it comes to helping users trace model performance problems all the way to the data. We focus on the particular problem of slicing data to identify subsets of the validation data where the model performs poorly. This is an important problem in model validation because the overall model performance can fail to reflect that of the smaller subsets, and slicing allows users to analyze the model performance on a more granular-level. Unlike general techniques (e.g., clustering) that can find arbitrary slices, our goal is to find interpretable slices (which are easier to take action compared to arbitrary subsets) that are large and problematic. We propose Slice Finder, which is an interactive framework for identifying such slices using statistical techniques. Applications include diagnosing model fairness and fraud detection, where identifying slices that are interpretable to humans is crucial.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111694", "output": "Hybrid Distributed-Shared Memory Parallelization of Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms using a General Skeleton Library for Multi-Core Clusters.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In addition, the most powerful parallel systems available nowadays are computer clusters composed of distributed-memory nodes that contain an increasing number of cores that share a common memory. The optimal exploitation of these systems often requires resorting to a hybrid model that mimics the underlying hardware by combining a distributed and a shared memory parallel programming model. This results in longer development times and increased maintenance costs. In this paper we present a very general skeleton library that allows to parallelize any divide-and-conquer problem in hybrid distributed-shared memory systems with little effort while providing much flexibility and good performance. Our proposal combines a message-passing paradigm at the process level and a threaded model inside each process, hiding the related complexity from the user. The evaluation shows that this skeleton provides performance comparable, and often better than that of manually optimized codes while requiring considerably less effort when parallelizing applications on multi-core clusters.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111695", "output": "\"Optimizing Inter-FPGA Routing for High-Performance and Low-Execution-Time Prototyping: A Comparative Study of Four Topologies\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Inter-FPGA routing interconnect and the quality of associated tool play a very important role in the performance of final prototyped design. In this work, we present a detailed comparison between four inter-FPGA interconnect routing topologies. We present a generic inter-FPA routing tool and for each topology, ten large benchmarks are prototyped on four different FPGA boards. Experimental results show that interconnect topology using a hybrid combination of two and multipoint tracks gives best results for smaller FPGA boards while topology using hybrid combination of switch-based and direct multi point tracks gives best frequency results for large FPGA boards and this frequency gain increases with increase in the number of FPGAs on board. We also perform execution time comparison between four interconnect topologies and the topology using direct two point connections only gives the best overall execution results. This topology, on average, requires 12%, 82%, and 70% less execution time as compared to other interconnect topologies under consideration.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "111696", "output": "\"Efficient Verification of Simple Programs: Bounds on the Complexity of the Non-Zeroness Test\"\n\nor\n\n\"Computing the Non-Zeroness Test: A Study of Simple Instruction Sequences\"\n\nor\n\n\"Simple Program Verification: A Lower Bound on the Time Complexity of the Non-Zeroness Test\"\n\nThese titles", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

But despite the many taint trackers in practical use, the question of what, exactly, tainting means - what security policy item bodies - remains largely unexplored. We propose explicit secrecy, a generic framework capturing the essence of explicit flows, i.e., the data flows tracked by tainting. The framework is semantic, generalizing previous syntactic approaches to formulating soundness criteria of tainting. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework by instantiating it with both a simple high-level imperative language and an idealized RISC machine. To further understanding of what is achieved by taint tracking tools, both dynamic and static, we obtain soundness results with respect to explicit secrecy for the tainting engine cores of a collection of popular dynamic and static taint trackers.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111698", "output": "\"Automating Chart Pattern Search: A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Rule-Based Optimization\"\n\nor \n\n\"Genetic Optimization for Rule-Based Chart Pattern Search: A Novel Approach to Automated Pattern Generation\"\n\nor \n\n\"Rising-Support Pattern Generation: A Genetic Algorithm Framework for Automatic Chart Pattern Search\"\n\nor \n\n\"Optimizing Rule", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

There are two representative types of problems in chart pattern analysis: the matching problem and the search problem. There have been extensive studies on chart pattern matching. However, chart pattern search has not yet drawn much interest. Instead of automatic search, most studies use chart patterns manually designed by financial experts. In this paper, we suggest an automatic algorithm that searches a rule-based chart pattern. We formulate rule-based chart pattern search as an optimization problem for a genetic algorithm. The suggested genetic algorithm includes a considerable amount of problem-specific manipulation. The algorithm successfully found attractive patterns working on the Korean stock market. We studied the rules used in the found patterns, noting that they are rising-support patterns. In addition, the automated pattern generation uses designs at a higher level of abstraction.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111699", "output": "\"Unveiling Behavioural Evolution: A Multifaceted Approach to Identifying Progressive Changes in Human Activities\"\n\nor\n\n\"Behavioural Evolution: A Composite Indicator for Detecting Progressive Changes in Multiple Activities\"\n\nor\n\n\"Progressive Changes in Human Activities: A Novel Framework for Identifying Normal and Abnormal Behavioural", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this presentation, we pay attention to some contributions of operations research to the design and the study of some voting procedures. First, we show through an easy example that the voting procedure plays an important role in the determination of the winner: for an election with four candidates, the choice of the voting procedure allows electing anyone of the four candidates with the same individual preferences of the voters. This provides also the opportunity to recall some main procedures, including Condorcet\u2019s procedure, and leads to the statement of Arrow\u2019s theorem. In a second step, more devoted to a mathematical approach, we detail a voting procedure based on the concept of Condorcet winner, namely the so-called median procedure. In this procedure, the aim is to rank the candidates in order to minimize the number of disagreements with respect to the voters\u2019 preferences. Thus we obtain a combinatorial optimization problem. We show how to state it as a linear programming problem with binary variables. We specify the complexity of this median procedure. Last, we show, once again through easy examples, that the lack of some desirable properties for the considered voting procedure may involve some \u201cparadoxes\u201d.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111704", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Adaptive Estimated Inverse Output-Feedback Quantized Control Scheme for Piezoelectric Positioning Stage\"\n\"Quantized Control of Piezoelectric Actuator with Adaptive Estimated Inverse Compensator\"\n\"Real-Time", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

First, the quantized issue due to the use of computer is addressed by introducing a linear time-varying quantizer model where the quantizer parameters can be estimated on-line. Second, by using the fuzzy approximator, the developed controller can avoid the identification of the parameters in the piezoelectric positioning stage. Third, by constructing the estimated inverse compensator of the hysteresis, the hysteresis nonlinearities in the piezoelectric actuator are mitigated; Fourth, the states observer is designed to avoid the measurements of the velocity and acceleration signals. The analysis of stability shows all the signals in the piezoelectric positioning stage are uniformly ultimately bounded and the prespecified tracking performance of the quantized control system is achieved by employing the error transformed function. Finally, a computer controlled experiments for the piezoelectric positioning stage is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed quantized controller.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111705", "output": "\"Coherent Integration and Detection of Maneuvering Targets using Keystone Transform and Matched Filtering Process\"\n\nor\n\n\"Improved Target Detection with KT-MFP: A Comparative Study\"\n\nor\n\n\"Keystone Transform-Matched Filtering Process for Superior Maneuvering Target Detection\"\n\nor\n\n\"Enhanced Coherent Integration and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The resulting noise in the acquired image could be effectively modelled as signal-dependent Poisson noise or as a mixture of Poisson and Gaussian noise. To that end, we propose a generalized framework based on detection theory and hypothesis testing coupled with the variance stability transformation (VST) for Poisson or Poisson-Gaussian denoising. VST transforms signal-dependent Poisson noise to a signal independent Gaussian noise with stable variance. Subsequently, multiscale transforms are employed on the noisy image to segregate signal and noise into separate coefficients. That facilitates the application of local binary hypothesis testing on multiple scales using empirical distribution function (EDF) for the purpose of detection and removal of noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with different multiscale transforms and on a wide variety of input datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111707", "output": "\"Next-Generation Networks: Balancing Latency and Capacity for Mission-Critical Applications\"\n\nor\n\n\"Beyond 5G: Overcoming Technical Challenges for the Internet of Things and Mission-Critical Communications\"\n\nor\n\n\"Latency-Critical Networks: Designing for the Future of Mobile and Fixed Communications\"\n\nor \n\n\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

By explicitly incorporating the carrier sense threshold and the transmit power into our analysis, we derive an analytical relation between MAC throughput and system parameters. In homogeneous networks, we derive the optimal carrier sense range at a given node density as a function of the ratio between the transmit power and the carrier sense threshold. The obtained optimal carrier sense range is smaller than that for covering the entire interference range, which is in sharp contrast to what has been considered to be optimal in previous studies. Only when the node density goes to infinity, the optimal carrier sense range converges to that for exactly covering the interference range, thereby eliminating all the hidden nodes. For nonhomogeneous networks, any distributed algorithm for tuning the carrier sense threshold, in which each node tries to maximize its own throughput without coordination, may significantly degrade MAC throughput. In order to properly design a distributed algorithm, each node not only considers its own throughput, but also needs to take account of its adverse impact on others. Our analysis is verified by simulation studies under various network scenarios.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "111710", "output": "\"Joint Timing and Carrier Phase Synchronization of Minimum Shift Keying Signals in Symmetric-Stable Noise: Cramer-Rao Lower Bound, Optimal Training Sequence, and Robust Estimation Algorithm\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this letter, we focus on the joint timing and carrier phase synchronization of minimum shift keying signals in SS noise. We first derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of joint timing and carrier phase offsets estimation. Then, an optimal synchronization training sequence is designed to minimize the CRLB. As the corresponding maximum likelihood estimator is hard to implement in SS noise, we further propose a pragmatic synchronization parameters estimation algorithm based on explicit myriad cost function and a global optimization method. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm works well and is robust to the estimation errors of received signal-to-noise ratio and SS noise parameter.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.75}, {"id": "111711", "output": "\"Entropy Inequality for Non-One-to-One Functions: Tight Bounds and Applications\"\n\nor\n\n\"Tight Bounds on Non-One-to-One Function Entropy: A Novel Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Non-One-to-One Function Entropy: Bounds and Illustrative Examples\"\n\nor\n\n\"Bounding Entropy of Non-One-to-One Functions:", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, while they may be characterized by better accuracy, larger DNNs require significant energy and area, thereby limiting their wide adoption. The energy consumption of DNNs is driven by both memory accesses and computation. Binarized neural networks (BNNs), as a tradeoff between accuracy and energy consumption, can achieve great energy reduction and have good accuracy for large DNNs due to their regularization effect. However, BNNs show poor accuracy when a smaller DNN configuration is adopted. In this article, we propose a new DNN architecture, LightNN, which replaces the multiplications to one shift or a constrained number of shifts and adds. Our theoretical analysis for LightNNs shows that their accuracy is maintained while dramatically reducing storage and energy requirements. For a fixed DNN configuration, LightNNs have better accuracy at a slight energy increase than BNNs, yet are more energy efficient with only slightly less accuracy than conventional DNNs. Therefore, LightNNs provide more options for hardware designers to trade off accuracy and energy. Moreover, for large DNN configurations, LightNNs have a regularization effect, making them better in accuracy than conventional DNNs.

Current methods first register the input low dynamic range (LDR) images using optical flow before merging them. This process is error-prone, and often causes ghosting in the resulting merged image. We propose a novel dual-attention-guided end-to-end deep neural network, called DAHDRNet, which produces high-quality ghost-free HDR images. Unlike previous methods that directly stack the LDR images or features for merging, we use dual-attention modules to guide the merging according to the reference image. DAHDRNet thus exploits both spatial attention and feature channel attention to achieve ghost-free merging. The spatial attention modules automatically suppress undesired components caused by misalignments and saturation, and enhance the fine details in the non-reference images. The channel attention modules adaptively rescale channel-wise features by considering the inter-dependencies between channels. The dual-attention approach is applied recurrently to further improve feature representation, and thus alignment. A dilated residual dense block is devised to make full use of the hierarchical features and increase the receptive field when hallucinating missing details. We employ a hybrid loss function, which consists of a perceptual loss, a total variation loss, and a content loss to recover photo-realistic images. Although DAHDRNet is not flow-based, it can be applied to flow-based registration to reduce artifacts caused by optical-flow estimation errors. Experiments on different datasets show that the proposed DAHDRNet achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111714", "output": "Online Crowd Anomaly Detection via Spatio-Temporal Feature Descriptor and Dual-Channel Convolutional Neural Network for Efficient Real-Time Analysis\n\nor\n\nReal-Time Online Crowd Anomaly Detection Using Spatio-Temporal Feature Descriptor and DCCNN for Efficient and Accurate Behavior Identification\n\nor\n\nEfficient Online Crowd An", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A dual-channel convolutional neural network (DCCNN) has been set up for efficiently processing scene-related and motion-related crowd information inherited from raw frames and the compound descriptor instances. The novelty of the work stemmed from the creation of the spatio-temporal cuboids in online (or near real-time) manner through dynamically extracting local feature tracklets within the temporal space while handling the foreground region-of-interests (i.e., moving targets) through the exploration of Gaussian Mixture Model in the spatial space. Hence, the extracted foreground blocks can effectively eliminate irrelevant backgrounds and noises from the live streams for reducing the computational costs in the subsequent detecting phases. The devised compound feature descriptor, named as spatio-temporal feature descriptor (STFD), is capable of characterizing the crowd attributes through the measures such as collectiveness, stability, conflict and density in each online generated spatio-temporal cuboid. A STFD instance registers not only the dynamic variation of the targeted crowd over time based on local feature tracklets, but also the interaction information of neighborhoods within a crowd, e.g., the interaction force through the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) analysis. The DCCNN developed in this research enables online identification of suspicious crowd behaviors based on analyzing the live-feed images and their STFD instances. The proposed model has been developed and evaluated against benchmarking techniques and databases. Experimental results have shown substantial improvements in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency for online crowd abnormal behavior identification.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.17}, {"id": "111715", "output": "Based on the provided similar abstract-title pairs, I will generate a title.\n\n\"Sliding Mode Control for Fixed-Time Consensus Tracking in Multi-Agent Networks with Uncertain Dynamics\"\n\nor\n\n\"Distributed Consensus Tracking Control with Fixed-Time Convergence for Multi-Agent Systems under Uncertainty\"\n\nor\n\n\"Fixed-Time Consensus Tracking", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Then, with the aid of the observer method and sliding mode technique, the distributed nonsingular controller is designed for the underlying system to ensure that the consensus tracking errors go into sliding mode manifold and converge to origin within a desired time. Finally, examples are presented to verify the validity of the new control strategy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111716", "output": "Temporal Logic and Logic Programming Approaches to Compliance Verification: A Comparative Analysis and Translation Procedure.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In the past both the frameworks of Temporal Logics and Logic Programming have been extensively exploited to assess compliance in different domains, such as normative multi-agent systems, business process management and service oriented computing. In this work we review the LTL and SCIFF frameworks in the light of compliance evaluation, and formally investigate the relationship between the two approaches. We define a notion of compliance within each approach, and then we show that an arbitrary LTL formula can be expressed in SCIFF, by providing a translation procedure from LTL to SCIFF which preserves compliance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.37}, {"id": "111717", "output": "\"Mitigating Non-Line-of-Sight Interference in Ultrawideband Localization: A Novel Dynamic Algorithm for Real-World Applications\"\n\nor \n\n\"UWB Localization with NLOS Noise Mitigation: A Novel Approach for Dynamic Environments\"\n\nor \n\n\"Estimating and Mitigating Non-Line-of-Sight Errors", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For robust and high performance in real environment, the most challenging issue is the detection and mitigation of noise from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. Current researches use channel state information, particle or Kalman filter, and statistics based approaches for the NLOS noise detection and mitigation. These solutions show high accuracy in some applications; however, they need additional hardware and work in static environment only. We propose an NLOS mitigation algorithm that does not need any additional hardware and works in dynamic environment with mobile obstacles. The main idea of the algorithm are to estimate the NLOS bias by repetitively comparing the intersection of the hyperbolas with intersections of circles. The proposed approach is tested for Decawave UWB testbed. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme works well in different dynamic scenarios as compared to the localization scheme without NLOS noise mitigation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111718", "output": "Fast, Lightweight, and Reliable File System for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Hybrid Memory Design Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A file storage system that is fast, lightweight, and reliable across device failures is important to safeguard the data that these devices record. A fast and lightweight file system should enable sensed data to be sampled and stored quickly for later transmission, while imposing a small resource footprint. A reliable file system should provide storage integrity in the face of hardware, software, and other failures. We present the design and implementation of LoggerFS, a fast, lightweight, and reliable file system for wireless sensor networks which uses a hybrid memory design consisting of RAM, FRAM, and flash. LoggerFS is engineered to provide fast data storage, have a small memory footprint, and provide data reliability across system failures. Additionally, LoggerFS is designed to be power efficient. LoggerFS adapts a log-structured file system approach, augmented with data persistence and reliability guarantees. A caching mechanism allows for flash wear-leveling and fast data buffering. We present a performance evaluation of LoggerFS using a prototypical in situ sensing platform, and demonstrate between 50% and 800% improvements for various workloads using the FRAM write-back cache.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "111719", "output": "\"Optimizing Resource Allocation in Distributed Cloud Computing via Markov Decision Process Analysis: A Trivial-Nontrivial Framework for Task Preservation and Admission\"\n\nor\n\n\"Cloud Resource Management Dilemmas in Distributed Cloud Computing: A Simplified Framework for Task Admission and Preservation via Markov Decision Process Analysis\"\n\nor\n\n\"S", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These admission and preservation decisions have significant impact on the cloud performance and operational cost, as they impact future system decisions. Should a cloud manager prefer to use resources for new task admissions and increase the risk of dropping an already admitted task in the future? Or should he/she prefer to maintain resources for potential future task preservations at the expense of new task admissions? These dilemmas are even more critical in Distributed Cloud Computing (DCC) due to the small scale of the micro Cloud Computing Center (mCCC). In this paper we will address these questions through the use of Markov Decision Process (MDP) analysis. We will show that even though the problem appears to be rather complicated (as the two decision rules are coupled), our analysis reveals that it can be significantly simplified (as one of the rules is of a trivial form). These results enables us to compose a holistic framework for cloud computing task management.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111720", "output": "\"Accelerating Graph-Based RDF Query Processing via Dynamic Task Scheduling and Hierarchical Memory Interface Control\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Graph methods exhibit an irregular behavior: they present unpredictable, fine-grained data accesses, and are synchronization intensive. Graph data structures expose large amounts of dynamic parallelism, but are difficult to partition without generating load unbalance. In this paper, we present a novel architecture to improve the synthesis of graph methods. Our design addresses the issues of these algorithms with two components: a Dynamic Task Scheduler (DTS), which reduces load unbalance and maximize resource utilization, and a Hierarchical Memory Interface controller (HMI), which provides support for concurrent memory operations on multi-ported/multi-banked shared memories. We evaluate our approach by generating the accelerators for a set of SPARQL queries from the Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM). We first analyze the load unbalance of these queries, showing that execution time among tasks can differ even of order of magnitudes. We then synthesize the queries and compare the performance of the resulting accelerators against the current state of the art. Experimental results show that our solution provides a speedup over the serial implementation close to the theoretical maximum and a speedup up to 3.45 over a baseline parallel implementation. We conclude our study by exploring the design space to achieve maximum memory channels utilization. The best design used at least three of the four memory channels for more than 90% of the execution time.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111721", "output": "Interaction Patterns and Length of Stay in Trauma Systems: A Spectral Co-Clustering Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Robust and reliable interactions among health care employees can reduce LOS. However, there is little known about whether certain patterns of interactions exist and how they relate to LOS and its variability. The objective of this study is to learn interaction patterns and quantify the relationship to LOS within a mature trauma system and long-standing electronic medical record (EMR). Methods: We adapted a spectral co-clustering methodology to infer the interaction patterns of health care employees based on the EMR of 5588 hospitalized adult trauma survivors. The relationship between interaction patterns and LOS was assessed via a negative binomial regression model. We further assessed the influence of potential confounders by age, number of health care encounters to date, number of access action types care providers committed to patient EMRs, month of admission, phenome-wide association study codes, procedure codes, and insurance status. Results: Three types of interaction patterns were discovered. The first pattern exhibited the most collaboration between employees and was associated with the shortest LOS. Compared to this pattern, LOS for the second and third patterns was 0.61 days (P = 0.014) and 0.43 days (P = 0.037) longer, respectively. Although the 3 interaction patterns dealt with different numbers of patients in each admission month, our results suggest that care was provided for similar patients. Discussion: The results of this study indicate there is an association between LOS and the extent to which health care employees interact in the care of an injured patient. The findings further suggest that there is merit in ascertaining the content of these interactions and the factors that induce these differences in interaction patterns within a trauma system.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "111722", "output": "\"Wavelet Frame Energy Distribution-Based Medical Image Segmentation Using Convex Relaxation Approach\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This work shows that the wavelet frame energy distribution contains the fine texture information extracted from images with low intensity contrast and complex structures using wavelet frame transform. Thus it is employed to enhance the segmentation quality under some challenge conditions such as low intensity contrast, weak/ambiguous boundaries, intensity inhomogeneity and heavy noise. Furthermore, this paper adopts convex relaxation approach to solve the corresponding optimization problem instead of classical level-set method, so the leading numerical computation is efficient and robust to initialization values. Experimental results also illustrate the efficiency of the proposed segmentation method for biomedical images under these extreme imaging conditions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111723", "output": "Partial-Softmax Loss based Deep Hashing for Efficient Image Retrieval", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, it is still a challenge to learn discriminative hash codes for preserving the label information of images efficiently. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, we propose a novel Partial-Softmax Loss based Deep Hashing, called PSLDH, to generate high-quality hash codes. Specifically, PSLDH first trains a category hashing network to generate a discriminative hash code for each category, and the hash code will preserve semantic information of the corresponding category well. Then, instead of defining the similarity between datapairs using their corresponding label vectors, we directly use the learned hash codes of categories to supervise the learning process of image hashing network, and a novel Partial-SoftMax loss is proposed to optimize the image hashing network. By minimizing the novel Partial-SoftMax loss, the learned hash codes can preserve the label information of images sufficiently. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in image retrieval task.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.32}, {"id": "111724", "output": "Temporal Syntactic Fusion for Event Classification: A Comparative Study of GRU-based Architectures", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Man-in-the- Middle (MITM) phishing toolkits are the latest evolution in this space, where toolkits act as malicious reverse proxy servers of online services, mirroring live content to users while extracting cre- dentials and session cookies in transit. These tools further reduce the work required by attackers, automate the harvesting of 2FA- authenticated sessions, and substantially increase the believability of phishing web pages. In this paper, we present the first analysis of MITM phishing toolkits used in the wild. By analyzing and experimenting with these toolkits, we identify intrinsic network-level properties that can be used to identify them. Based on these properties, we develop a machine learning classifier that identifies the presence of such toolkits in online communications with 99.9% accuracy. We conduct a large-scale longitudinal study of MITM phishing toolkits by creating a data-collection framework that monitors and crawls suspicious URLs from public sources. Using this infrastruc- ture, we capture data on 1,220 MITM phishing websites over the course of a year. We discover that MITM phishing toolkits occupy a blind spot in phishing blocklists, with only 43.7% of domains and 18.9% of IP addresses associated with MITM phishing toolkits present on blocklists, leaving unsuspecting users vulnerable to these attacks. Our results show that our detection scheme is resilient to the cloaking mechanisms incorporated by these tools, and is able to detect previously hidden phishing content. Finally, we propose methods that online services can utilize to fingerprint requests origi- nating from these toolkits and stop phishing attempts as they occur.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111726", "output": "Identification of Moonlighting Long Non-Coding RNAs through Integration of Protein Interactome, RNA-Protein Interactions and Functional Annotation of Proteins", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although there have long been calls for computational algorithms for the identification of moonlighting proteins, research on approaches to identify moonlighting long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has never been undertaken. Here, we introduce a novel methodology, MoonFinder, for the identification of moonlighting lncRNAs. MoonFinder is a statistical algorithm identifying moonlighting lncRNAs without a priori knowledge through the integration of protein interactome, RNA-protein interactions and functional annotation of proteins. Results: We identify 155 moonlighting lncRNA candidates and uncover that they are a distinct class of lncRNAs characterized by specific sequence and cellular localization features. The non-coding genes that transcript moonlighting lncRNAs tend to have shorter but more exons and the moonlighting lncRNAs have a variable localization pattern with a high chance of residing in the cytoplasmic compartment in comparison to the other lncRNAs. Moreover, moonlighting lncRNAs and moonlighting proteins are rather mutually exclusive in terms of both their direct interactions and interacting partners. Our results also shed light on how the moonlighting candidates and their interacting proteins implicated in the formation and development of cancers and other diseases.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "111727", "output": "\"Dynamic Sampling Strategies for Pointwise Imaging: A Comparative Analysis of Static and Adaptive Approaches\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Dynamic Sampling Methods\", \"Sparse Sampling Schemes\", \"Pointwise Imaging Techniques\"]\n[\"Adaptive Sampling Strategies\", \"Static Sampling Approaches\", \"Real-Time Imaging Methods\"]\n[\"Sampling Pattern Optimization\", \"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Given a large problem that produces many subproblems, the proposed method dynamically swaps subproblems out to CPU memory. We adopt two strategies to realize this swapping-out procedure with minimum amount of CPU-GPU data transfer. The first strategy is a GPU-based stream compaction strategy that reduces the sparseness of arrays. The second strategy is a double buffering strategy that hides the data transfer overhead by overlapping data transfer with GPU-based Bu0026B operations. Experimental results show that the proposed method can store 33.7 times more subproblems than the previous method, solving twice more instances on the GPU. As for the stream compaction strategy, an input-output separated scheme runs (13.1%) faster than an input-output unified scheme.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.01}, {"id": "111732", "output": "\"Novel Non-Orthogonal Multi-Band Carrier-Less Amplitude and Phase Scheme for Enhanced Spectral Efficiency in Visible Light Communication Systems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Today's healthcare industry emphasizes safety, efficiency, patient-oriented approach, timeliness and balance. u-healthcare makes it possible to safely deliver appropriate services from any location at any time. To explain the emergence of u-healthcare, one must invoke, first of all, progress in IT and medical technology, and then the desire and willingness on the part of health care institutions to adopt the new service concept and increased health care demand. Digitalization of information, introduction of broadband communication and leaps made in healthcare technology in recent years have provided the technological capacity necessary for the achievement of u-healthcare. Based on recently reached theoretical results, integrating u-healthcare environments in virtual organizations, we proposed a methodology for the design and implementation of u-healthcare, linking the distributed mobile agents with medical entities into a convergence and collaborative environment. Despite the challenges in implementing and deploying u-healthcare, the advantages of ubiquitous healthcare are enabled by our smart model for the soft computing endowed ubiquitous. The strength of our approach is that it relates to u-healthcare a system which consists of its dual character emerging from the synergetic interaction between ubiquitous computing techniques and the mobile devices in convergence manner. We have developed a set of initial healthcare agent services on the mobile collaboration framework. We evaluate the functionality and effectiveness of our convergence mobile agent, whether the platform can manage services based on the model and whether the results of u-healthcare services discovery could satisfy user's requirements with example cases.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111736", "output": "\"Revealing Hidden Information in 3D Terrain Visualization: A Novel Approach to Occlusion Management with Complementary Visibility Widgets\"\n\nor\n\n\"Enhancing 3D Terrain Visualization through Interactive Occlusion Management: A Study on the Effective Utilization of Visibility Widgets\"\n\nor\n\n\"Overcoming Occlusion Challenges in 3", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This can lead to significant loss of information. To address this issue, we introduce visibility widgets: compact auxiliary views that visualize occluded data, their locations, and related properties, and thus support users in revealing hidden information. The widgets comprise different occlusion management strategies for detecting and analyzing invisible data inside as well as outside of the field of view. In addition, each widget is designed complementary and transient to facilitate interactive exploration and navigation while not monopolizing the user\u2019s attention. We demonstrate the application of visibility widgets focusing the visual exploration of weather data in 3D terrain.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111737", "output": "\"Optimizing Plug-in Electric Vehicle Integration in Smart Grids through a Two-Tier SDN Framework for Enhanced System Flexibility and Reliability\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Due to the stochastic characteristics of PEVs, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, and the heterogeneity of the devices, it is a great challenge to achieve system flexibility, reliability, and interoperability. To address these issues, we propose a two-tier SDN-based framework for the PEV integrated smart grid. The upper tier targets the primary feeder level to have a general view of the system, while the lower tier focuses on the secondary feeder level to achieve granular control of data and power operation. The framework is presented hierarchically, followed by a detailed explanation of the system operation in each tier. In particular, the integration of PEVs, which includes both PEV charging and V2G, is well illustrated in the SDNbased framework. Finally, we provide a case study to validate the emerging need for SDN deployment in the smart grid.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "111738", "output": "Determining the Optimal Timing for Guided Visual Analytics Sessions: A Facial Expression-Based Approach to Enhance Analyst Productivity", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the effectiveness of guidance depends on many factors: Determining the right timing to provide it is one of them. Although in complex analysis scenarios choosing the right timing could make the difference between a dependable and a superfluous guidance, an analysis of the literature suggests that this problem did not receive enough attention. In this paper, we describe a methodology to determine moments in which guidance is needed. Our assumption is that the need of guidance would influence the user state-of-mind, as in distress situations during the analytical process, and we hypothesize that such moments could be identified by analyzing the user's facial expressions. We propose a framework composed by a facial recognition software and a machine learning model trained to detect when to provide guidance according to changes of the user facial expressions. We trained the model by interviewing eight analysts during their work and ranked multiple facial features based on their relative importance in determining the need of guidance. Finally, we show that by applying only minor modifications to its architecture, our prototype was able to detect a need of guidance on the fly and made our methodology well suited also for real-time analysis sessions. The results of our evaluations show that our methodology is indeed effective in determining when a need of guidance is present, which constitutes a prerequisite to providing timely and effective guidance in VA.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111739", "output": "\"Augmenting Agile Project Management with Artificial Intelligence: A Framework for Enhanced Productivity and Success\"\n\nor\n\n\"Artificial Intelligence in Agile Project Management: Leveraging AI for Optimized Project Analytics and Decision-Making\"\n\nor\n\n\"AI-Driven Agile Project Management: A Novel Framework for Accelerating Project Success and Product", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Project management has a large socio-technical element with many uncertainties arising from variability in human aspects, e.g. customers' needs, developers' performance and team dynamics. AI can assist project managers and team members by automating repetitive, high-volume tasks to enable project analytics for estimation and risk prediction, providing actionable recommendations, and even making decisions. AI is potentially a game changer for project management in helping to accelerate productivity and increase project success rates. In this paper, we propose a framework where AI technologies can be leveraged to offer support for managing agile projects, which have become increasingly popular in the industry.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111740", "output": "\"Designing Personas for Online Learning: A User-Centered Approach to Informing Professional Development and Education\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Designing Personas for Online Learning\", \"Creating Personas for User-Centered Design\"]\n[\"Informing Professional Development with Personas\", \"User-Centered Design for Online Learning\"]\n[\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To reduce the resource occupancy, a novel event-triggered strategy is proposed where the concern is to broadcast those necessary measurements to update the innovation information only when certain events appear. The primary goal of this paper is to design a recursive filter rendering that, under the event-triggered communication mechanism, an upper bound (UB) on the filtering error variance is ensured and then optimized by properly determining the filter gains. As a distinct kind of 2-D systems, the LRPs are cast into a general Fornasini\u2013Marchesini model by using the lifting technique. A new definition of the triggering-shift sequence is introduced and an event-triggered rule is then constructed for the transformed system. With the aid of mathematical induction, the filtering error variance is guaranteed to have a UB which is subsequently optimized with appropriate filter parameters via solving two series of Riccati-like difference equations. Theoretical analysis further reveals the monotonicity of the filtering performance with regard to the event-triggering threshold. Finally, an illustrative simulation is given to show the feasibility of the designed filtering scheme.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111742", "output": "Evaluating and Enhancing Personalisation in Information Retrieval: Building on WEPIR 2018", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although previous sequence modeling methods, such as Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRFs), demonstrated satisfactory recognition accuracy, they do not explicitly model the uncertainty in underlying temporal patterns, which can provide valuable information to characterize sequential activities. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Minimum Uncertainty HCRF (MU, or \u03bcHCRF). Different from traditional HCRF-based techniques that only utilize the negative log-likelihood of the categoriesu0027 conditional probability as the loss function, the proposed \u03bc-HCRF also introduces a regularization term to model the underlying temporal pattern of the latent variables. As another theoretical contribution, we provide a derivation to show that the formulated problem has a closed-form solution, and prove that inference of the proposed \u03bcHCRF is tractable. Extensive empirical study is performed to evaluate our approach, using four public benchmark datasets. Experimental results have shown that our \u03bcHCRFs outperform previous techniques and achieve state-of-the-art performance on human activity recognition, especially on sequential activities.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "111745", "output": "Passive Target Localization Using Asynchronous Self-Locating Receivers and Real-Time Particle Filtering", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The core idea is to use cars as a main ICT resource in modern smart cities being able to store, to forward, and to process data. Relying on the communication capabilities of cars, particularly their ability to use short range communication technologies such as IEEE 802.11p, Wi-Fi, or LTE-D2D, virtual micro clouds can be established similar to the concept of the mobile edge in 5G networks, yet, without any infrastructure support. However, there is a key disadvantage: the network will very likely become fragmented due to the mobility of the cars within the city. Furthermore, low penetration rates in early deployments may amplify this fragmentation. In recent work, we proposed the use of clusters of parked cars to overcome such limitations, i.e., to provide a virtual infrastructure in form of a virtual Roadside Unit (RSU) being able to fulfill all the mentioned actions. In this paper, we investigate two core problems of this system, namely the selection of appropriate gateway nodes in the virtual cluster as well as seamless handovers among such gateways required due to very limited contact times of moving cars to a single gateway. Our simulation results confirm the strength of the proposed gateway selection and handover mechanisms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111747", "output": "\"Securing Symmetric-Key RFID Ownership Transfer Protocols without Trusted Third Parties through Noisy Channel Communication\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Recently, there has been considerable interest in such protocols; however, guaranteeing privacy for symmetric-key settings without trusted third parties (TTPs) is a challenge still unresolved. In this paper, we address this issue and show that it can be solved by using channels with positive secrecy capacity. We implement these channels with noisy tags and provide practical values, thus proving that perfect secrecy is theoretically possible. We then define a communication model that captures spatiotemporal events and describe a first example of symmetric-key based OTP that: (i) is formally secure in the proposed communication model and (ii) achieves privacy with a noisy tag wiretap channel without TTPs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111748", "output": "\"Revolutionizing 5G Wireless Networks: A Service-Oriented Approach through Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) Taxonomy\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These changes over the current 4G bring many challenges on how to achieve an efficient operation from the network management perspective.

Specifically, by the idea of virtualizing the wireless networks, which has recently gained increasing attention, we introduce the everything-as-a-service (XaaS) taxonomy to light the way towards designing the service-oriented wireless networks. The concepts and challenges along with the research opportunities for realizing XaaS in wireless networks are overviewed and discussed.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "111749", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Efficient Visual Tracking via Hybrid POMDP Formulation\"\n\"Evolutionary Adaptive Framework for Visual Tracking in Varying Environments\"\n\"Adaptive Visual Tracking with Hybrid POMDP and GA-Based Optimization\"\n</", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The main focus is to guarantee visual tracking performance under varying environments without strongly-controlled situations or high-cost devices. The performance optimization is formulated as a dynamic adaptation of the system control parameters, i.e., threshold and adjusting parameters in a visual tracking algorithm, based on the hybrid of offline and online POMDPs. The hybrid POMDP allows the agent to construct world-belief models under uncertain environments in offline, and focus on the optimization of the system control parameters over the current world model in real-time. Since the visual tracking should satisfy strict real-time constraints, we restrict our attention to simpler and faster approaches instead of exploring the belief space of each world model directly. The hybrid POMDP is thus solved by an evolutionary adaptive framework employing the GA (Genetic Algorithm) and real-time Q-learning approaches in the optimally reachable genotype and phenotype spaces, respectively. Experiments were carried out extensively in the area of eye tracking using videos of various structures and qualities, and yielded very encouraging results. The framework can achieve an optimal performance by balancing the tracking accuracy and real-time constraints.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111750", "output": "\"Designing an Educational Provisioning System for Flexible Online Course Delivery: A Decoupled Architecture for Efficient Provisioning and Workload Reduction\"\n\nor\n\n\"Flexible Provisioning for Adult Education: A Novel Educational Provisioning System (EPS) Model for Managing Complex Logistic Processes in Online Course Environments\"\n\nor\n\n\"A Decentral", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This requires educational institutions to rethink their business and educational models, and develop more flexible online course solutions using ICT. An important downside of this trend is an increasingly complex logistic process that is very difficult to manage, in particular with respect to the provisioning process: which teaching and learning services and facilities should be made available, to whom, when, and how. Rather than implementing provisioning rules directly in the software applications that make up the online delivery environment, we propose a model for an educational provisioning system (EPS) that allows for highly flexible provisioning and reduces the workload drastically. This system is responsible for both expressing and processing provisioning rules that meet the demands of new (online) course models. It supports the use of so-called course access levels that enable to address and provision various learning target groups separately by means of a single course. For reasons of efficiency we suggest an architecture in which the EPS is loosely coupled to the applications in the teaching and learning environment. A first EPS implementation at the Open University of the Netherlands is presented and discussed.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111751", "output": "Distribution-Aware Word Sense Induction for Enhanced Language Understanding", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper develops a conceptual framework to support future studies of learning and teaching that incorporate gesture studies in programming contexts. In particular, this paper introduces how gesture has been used to study teaching and learning in another discipline, mathematics; critically reviews and interprets what concepts and methods may be most relevant to programming contexts; and also discusses what unique challenges programming contexts present to studies of gesture (e.g. differences in abstract versus concrete). We ground our understandings of gesture by using an observational study where we observed novice students learning to program. This paper concludes by suggesting potential avenues for future research in computing education that incorporate analyses of gesture in studies of teaching and learning.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111753", "output": "\"Computing the Centroid of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets via the Karnik-Mendel Algorithm: A Numerical Approach to Overcome the Limitation of Switch Point Determination\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Blockchain is an infrastructure allowing this, because transactions are broadcast to the entire community and verified by miners. A node (or a coalition of nodes) with high computational power can play the role of miner to verify and approve transactions by computing the proof of work. Miners follows a highest-fee-first-served policy, so that a provider of a Blockchain-based application has to pay a non-negligible fee per transaction, to increase the likelihood that the application proceeds. This makes Blockchain not suitable for small-value transactions often occurring in the crowdsourcing paradigm. To overcome this drawback, in this paper we propose an alternative to Blockchain, leveraging an online social network (we choose Twitter to provide a proof of concept). Our protocol works by building a meshed chain of public posts to ensure transaction security instead of proof of work, and no trustworthiness assumption is required for the social network provider.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111755", "output": "Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Systems: Leveraging Pre-Trained Language Models with Prompt-Aware Tuning-Free Exploitation and Open-Domain External Resources.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, there remain challenges for individual developers to create a knowledge-grounded dialogue system upon such big models because of the expensive cost of collecting the knowledge resources for supporting the system as well as tuning these large models for the task. To tackle these obstacles, we propose XDAI, a knowledge-grounded dialogue system that is equipped with the prompt-aware tuning-free PLM exploitation and supported by the ready-to-use open-domain external knowledge resources plus the easy-to-change domain-specific mechanism. With XDAI, the developers can leverage the PLMs without any fine-tuning cost to quickly create the open-domain dialogue systems as well as easily customize their own domain-specific systems. Extensive experiments including human evaluation, Turing test, and online evaluation have demonstrated the competitive performance of XDAI compared with the state-of-the-art general PLMs and specific PLMs for dialogue. XDAI pilots studies on the exploitation of PLMs and made intriguing findings which could be inspiring for the future research on other PLM-based applications. Developers and related researchers can get access to our repository at https://github.com/THUDM/XDAI, which presents a series of APIs, incremental toolkits and chatbot service of XDAI platform.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "111756", "output": "\"Autonomous Flag Coordination in Bipartite Graphs: A Multi-Round Game Approach to Multi-Agent Coordination Problems\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Autonomous Local Choices\", \"Autonomous Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Systems\"]\n[\"Multi-Round Games\", \"Sequential Decision-Making in Distributed Systems\"]\n[\"B", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Examples of such problems include classic consensus problems between nodes in a distributed computer network and the adoption of competing technology standards. We model such problems as a multi-round game between agents having flags of different colours to represent the finite choice options, and all agents seeking to achieve global patterns of colours through a succession of local colour-selection choices. We generalise and formalise the problem, proving results for the probabilities of achievement of common desired global states when these games are undertaken on bipartite graphs, extending known results for non-bipartite graphs. We also calculate probabilities for the game entering infinite cycles of non-convergence. In addition, we present a game-theoretic approach to the problem that has a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium where two players can simultaneously flip the colour of one of the opponent's nodes in the bipartite graph before or during a flag-coordination game.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111757", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title.

However, the electrodes may shift significantly between implantation and resection, during the time that the patient is monitored for iEEG recording. As a result, the accuracy of surgical planning based on electrode locations at the time of resection can be compromised. Previous studies have only quantified the electrode shift with respect to the skull, but not with respect to the cortical surface, because tracking cortical shift between surgeries is challenging. In this study, we use an intraoperative stereovision (iSV) system to visualize and localize the cortical surface as well as electrodes, record three-dimensional (3D) locations of the electrodes in MR space at the time of implantation and resection, respectively, and quantify the raw displacements, i.e., with respect to the skull. Furthermore, we track the cortical surface and quantify the shift between surgeries using an optical flow (OF) based motion-tracking algorithm Finally, we compute the electrode shift with respect to the cortical surface by subtracting the cortical shift from raw measured displacements. We illustrate the method using one patient example. In this particular patient case, the results show that the electrodes not only shifted significantly with respect to the skull (8.79 +/- 3.00 mm in the lateral direction, ranging from 2.88 mm to 12.87 mm), but also with respect to the cortical surface (7.20 +/- 3.58 mm), whereas the cortical surface did not shift significantly in the lateral direction between surgeries (2.23 +/- 0.76 mm)\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111758", "output": "Optimal Cost Allocation in Wireless Multicast Networks through Linear Optimization and Truthful Mechanism Design", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A message available at a source node has to be disseminated through the network in a multi-hop manner. In order to incentivize a node to forward the source's message to others, a forwarding cost is paid to a forwarder by its respective receiver. In the case of multicast transmission, the cost is shared among the receivers using the Shapley value (SV). Moreover, a node may exploit the maximal ratio combining (MRC) technique to receive the message from multiple transmitting nodes. In this paper, we show that in a game theoretic framework, the optimal decision of a node for receiving the message with minimum cost can be achieved by solving a linear optimization problem. In addition, we propose an algorithm by which truthfulness is a dominant strategy for the nodes and thus, fair cost allocation is guaranteed. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm shares the cost of data dissemination among the nodes of a network in a fair manner. Compared to previous algorithms, the proposed algorithm can reduce the total cost paid by the nodes in the network for receiving messages.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "111759", "output": "\"Optimization of Bi-Level IIR-Based Bit-Stream Multipliers for Enhanced Signal-to-Noise Performance\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The visualized image shall convey as much information as possible from the original data and facilitate image interpretation. Most existing methods display HSIs in false colors, which contradict with human's experience and expectation. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear approach to visualize an input HSI with natural colors by taking advantage of a corresponding RGB image. Our approach is based on Moving Least Squares (MLS), an interpolation scheme for reconstructing a surface from a set of control points, which in our case is a set of matching pixels between the HSI and the corresponding RGB image. Based on MLS, the proposed method solves for each spectral signature a unique transformation so that the nonlinear structure of the HSI can be preserved. The matching pixels between a pair of HSI and RGB image can be reused to display other HSIs captured by the same imaging sensor with natural colors. Experiments show that the output images of the proposed method not only have natural colors but also maintain the visual information necessary for human analysis.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.02}, {"id": "111761", "output": "\"Mitigating the Filter Bubble: Evaluating the Effectiveness of Network Referrals in Social Networks\"\n\nor\n\n\"Evaluating the Potential of Network Referrals to Alleviate the Filter Bubble Effect in Online Social Networks\"\n\nor\n\n\"Assessing the Efficiency of Network Referrals in Promoting Social Welfare and Mit", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Connecting people to a new area of the network in a way that will cause them to become active in that area could help alleviate this effect and improve social welfare.\n\nHere we present preliminary analysis of network referrals, that is, attempts by users to connect peers to other areas of the network. We classify these referrals by their efficiency, i.e., the likelihood that a referral will result in a user becoming active in the new area of the network. We show that by using features describing past experience of the referring author and the content of their messages we are able to predict whether referral will be effective, reaching an AUC of 0.87 for those users most experienced in writing efficient referrals. Our results represent a first step towards algorithmically constructing efficient referrals with the goal of mitigating the \"filter bubble\" effect pervasive in on line social networks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111762", "output": "\"Relaxing Monotonicity and Expanding Domains: A Directional Approach to Interval-Valued Fuzzy Functions\"\n\nor\n\n\"Directional Monotonicity in Riesz Spaces: Bridging Axiomatic Relaxations and Domain Extensions\"\n\nor\n\n\"Monotonicity in the Multiverse:", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this work, we join both approaches by defining the concept of directional monotonicity for functions that take values in Riesz spaces. Additionally, we adapt this notion in order to work in certain convex sublattices of a Riesz space, which makes it possible to define the concept of directional monotonicity for functions whose purpose is to fuse uncertain data coming from type-2 fuzzy sets, fuzzy multisets, n-dimensional fuzzy sets, Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued fuzzy sets, among others. Focusing on the latter, we characterize directional monotonicity of interval-valued representable functions in terms of standard directional monotonicity.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111763", "output": "Deterministic Constructions of Compressed Sensing Matrices via Optimal Codebooks and Codes: Generalizing DeVore's and Li et al.'s Approaches", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In addition to a power constraint, we require the covariance of the transmit waveform be equal to a given optimal covariance for MIMO radar, to guarantee the radar performance. With this constraint, we formulate and solve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) balancing problem for multiuser transmit beamforming via convex optimization. Considering that the interference cannot be completely eliminated with this constraint, we introduce dirty paper coding (DPC) to further cancel the interference, and formulate the SINR balancing and sum rate maximization problem in the DPC regime. Although both of the two problems are non-convex, we show that they can be reformulated to convex optimizations via the Lagrange and downlink-uplink duality. In addition, we propose gradient projection based algorithms to solve the equivalent dual problem of SINR balancing, in both transmit beamforming and DPC regimes. The simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvement of DPC over transmit beamforming, and also indicate that the degrees of freedom for the communication transmitter is restricted by the rank of the covariance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111765", "output": "\"Securing Emerging Non-Volatile Memories: A Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authenticity Framework for Confidential Data Storage\"\n\nor\n\n\"Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authenticity for Non-Volatile Emerging Memories: A Novel Architectural Solution\"\n\nor\n\n\"Protecting Cleartext Data in Emerging Non-Volatile Memories", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In fact NVMs, beside offering byte-addressability and data persistence, promise better scalability and higher capacity than DRAM. However, from a security point of view, the persistent nature of emerging memories provides a larger time window to exfiltrate data from a device with respect to current DRAM-based main memories, and NVMs have in general lower write endurance than DRAM, thus requiring wear-out conscious encryption schemes. In this work we propose an architectural solution to secure non-volatile emerging memories, providing confidentiality, integrity and authenticity to the entire set of data, addresses and commands. Our solution relies on securing and authenticating the entire information transport between the host controller and the memory, enabling the storage of cleartext data inside the NVM.

Through recent developments in deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) was explored as a method to improve upon traditional methods. Thus far, the DKT model has only considered the knowledge components and correctness as input, neglecting the other important features collected by computer-based learning platforms. This paper seeks to further improve upon DKT by incorporating more problem-level features. With this higher dimensional input, an adaption to the original DKT model structure is also proposed to convert the input into a low dimensional feature vector. Our results show that this adapted DKT model can effectively improve accuracy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.3}, {"id": "111767", "output": "Detecting Psychological Stress through Social Media Interactions: A Novel Approach to Proactive Care", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

E-learning systems with personalized recommendations should adapt the learning experience according to the goals of the individual learner. Aiming to facilitate personalization of a learning content, various kinds of techniques can be applied. Collaborative and social tagging techniques could be useful for enhancing recommendation of learning resources. In this paper, we analyze the suitability of different techniques for applying tag-based recommendations in e-learning environments. The most appropriate model ranking, based on tensor factorization technique, has been modified to gain the most efficient recommendation results. We propose reducing tag space with clustering technique based on learning style model, in order to improve execution time and decrease memory requirements, while preserving the quality of the recommendations. Such reduced model for providing tag-based recommendations has been used and evaluated in a programming tutoring system.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111769", "output": "Managing Uncertainty in Medicine: A Framework for Assessing Credibility and Planning Diagnostic Sequences\n\nor\n\n Assessing Credibility in Hypothetical Scenarios: A Novel Approach to Expert System Design for Uncertainty Management in Medicine\n\nor\n\n Uncertainty Management in Medicine: A Medical Expert System Framework for Hypo", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

But techniques for assessing credibility do not tell a problem solver what to do when it is uncertain. This is the focus of our current research. We have developed a medical expert system called MUM, for Managing Uncertainty in Medicine, that plans diagnostic sequences of questions, tests, and treatments. This paper describes the kinds of problems that MUM was designed to solve and gives a brief description of its architecture. More recently, we have built an empty version of MUM called MU, and used it to reimplement MUM and a small diagnostic system for plant pathology. The latter part of the paper describes the features of MU that make it appropriate for building expert systems that manage uncertainty.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111770", "output": "\"GeoCUTS: A Novel Algorithm for Minimizing Interference in Geo-Region-Based Experiments\"\n\nor \n\n\"GeoRegion Clustering for Web-Based Experiments: A Statistical Framework for Evaluating Interference and Balance\"\n\nor \n\n\"GeoCUTS: A Graph-Based Approach to Forming Geographically", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A popular way to run these experiments is to use geographical regions as units of experimentation, since this does not require tracking of individual users or browser cookies. Since users may issue queries from multiple geographical locations, geo-regions cannot be considered independent and interference may be present in the experiment. In this paper, we study this problem, and first present GeoCUTS, a novel algorithm that forms geographical clusters to minimize interference while preserving balance in cluster size. We use a random sample of anonymized traffic from Google Search to form a graph representing user movements, then construct a geographically coherent clustering of the graph. Our main technical contribution is a statistical framework to measure the effectiveness of clusterings. Furthermore, we perform empirical evaluations showing that the performance of GeoCUTS is comparable to hand-crafted geo-regions with respect to both novel and existing metrics.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111771", "output": "\"Personalized Atrial Fibrillation Detection via Multi-Physiological Feature Analysis and SVM Classification: A Comparative Study with Single-Channel Approaches\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Atrial Fibrillation Detection using Multi-Physiological Features and SVM\"\n\"Personalized AF Detection via 12-lead ECG Analysis and Classification", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

AF is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity, such as heart failure and stroke and affects mostly older persons and persons with other conditions (e.g. heart failure and coronary artery disease). In order to prevent such life threatening and life quality reducing conditions it is essential to provide better algorithms, capable of being integrated in low-cost personalized health systems.This paper presents a new algorithm for AF detection, which is based on the analysis of the three physiological characteristics of AF: 1) Irregularity of heart rate and; 2) Absence of P-waves and 3) Presence of fibrillatory waves. Based on these characteristics several features were extracted from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) and selected according to their discrimination ability. The classification between AF and non-AF episodes was performed using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model.Our results show that the identification of the fibrillatory patterns, using the proposed features, extracted from the analysis of 12-lead ECG improves the performance of the algorithm to a sensitivity of 88.5% and specificity 92.9%, when compared to our previous single-channel approach, in the same database.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111772", "output": "\"Enhancing Driver Braking Intention Identification with GHMM/GGAP-RBFNN Hybrid Model for Improved Accuracy and Timeliness\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The accuracy, practicality, and timeliness of the driving intention identification model are its key issues. In this paper, a novel driver\u2019s braking intention identification model based on the Gaussian mixture-hidden Markov model (GHMM) and generalized growing and pruning radial basis function neural network (GGAP-RBFNN) is proposed to improve the identification accuracy of the model. The simplest brake pedal and vehicle speed data that are easily obtained from the vehicle are used as an observation sequence to improve practicality of the model. The data of the pressing brake pedal stage are used to identify the braking intention to improve the timeliness of the model. The experimental data collected from real vehicle tests are used for off-line training and online identification. The research results show that the accuracy of driver\u2019s braking intention identification model based on the GHMM/GGAP-RBFNN hybrid model is 94.69% for normal braking and 95.57% for slight braking, which are, respectively, 26.55% and 17.72% higher than achieved by the GHMM. In addition, the data of the pressing brake pedal stage are used for intention identification, which is 1.2\u00a0s faster than that of the existing identification model based on the GHMM.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111773", "output": "Comparing the Efficacy of Projected Subgradient and Superiorization Methodologies for Constrained Minimization: A Feasibility-Centric Analysis", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The latter poses a computational difficulty, and, therefore, the projected subgradient method is applicable only when the feasible region is \u201csimple to project onto.\u201d In contrast to this, in the superiorization methodology a feasibility-seeking algorithm leads the overall process, and objective function steps are interlaced into it. This makes a difference because the feasibility-seeking algorithm employs projections onto the individual constraints sets and not onto the entire feasible region.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "111774", "output": "\"Human Aided Chatbots: Leveraging Crowd Computing for Scalable and Private Solutions\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Despite their widespread adoption, chatbots still suffer from a number of performance issue due to limitations with their programming and training. In this paper we discuss Human Aided Chatbots, i.e. chatbots that rely on humans in the loop to operate. Human Aided Chatbots exploit human intelligence, brought for instance by crowd workers or full-time employees, to fill the gaps caused by limitations of fully automated solutions. A recent example of Human Aided Chatbots is Facebook M. To achieve broader adoption, Human Aided Chatbots must overcome a number of issues, including scalability, low-latency, and privacy. In this short paper, we discuss how Crowd Computing performed in the enterprise could help overcoming such issues.

The Service Availability Forum has defined standards to support the realization of high available systems. Among these standards, the Availability Management Framework (AMF) is perhaps the most important one. AMF is a middleware service that coordinates redundant application components to ensure the high availability of the services. AMF requires a configuration that describes the provided services, their types, and the deployment infrastructure. The process of generating an AMF configuration takes as input the description of the software characteristics as well as the Configuration Requirements that specify the services to be provided. Due to the large number of parameters to be taken into account, the generation of an AMF configuration can be a difficult and error-prone task. This paper proposes a new approach for the automatic generation of AMF configurations. The proposed solution is model-driven and is based on UML profiles which capture the concepts related to Configuration Requirements, software description, and AMF configurations. AMF configurations are generated using ATL-based transformations defined between these different profiles.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.84}, {"id": "111776", "output": "Temporal Conceptual Graphs for Efficient Storage and Management of Health Data in Cloud-Based Wireless Storage Area Networks", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are considered among the major sources that enable the collection of such kind of data that shares in most cases the properties of big data and that needs to be stored and managed in an efficient manner. Regarding this need, Wireless Storage Area Networks (WSANs) have been considered among the alternatives to store generated health data. Even if these infrastructures enable the storage of huge volumes of data, there are some issues related to the efficient storage and processing of health data that still not resolved and that are of interest for the research communities. In this context, this paper proposes a cloud-based WSAN approach that enables the storage and the management of health data in an efficient manner by representing the collected data and their dependencies using Temporal Conceptual Graphs (TCGs). The validity of the generated graphs is verified by the proposed graph checker that enables the localization of semantic errors in such structure to prevent some threats to be realized for stored health data and to ensure the privacy of patients. The efficiency of the proposed approach is illustrated for different defined scenarios of diseases and their associated health data represented through generated TCGs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111777", "output": "Flying Telepresence for Multi-Scale Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration: Enabling Large-Scale Remote Collaboration in Construction Environments", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this study, we proposed an Edge-group Sparse PCA (ESPCA) model by incorporating the group structure from a prior gene network into the PCA framework for dimension reduction and feature interpretation. ESPCA enforces sparsity of principal component (PC) loadings through considering the connectivity of gene variables in the prior network. We developed an alternating iterative algorithm to solve ESPCA. The key of this algorithm is to solve a new k-edge sparse projection problem and a greedy strategy has been adapted to address it. Here we adopted ESPCA for analyzing multiple gene expression matrices simultaneously. By incorporating prior knowledge, our method can overcome the drawbacks of sparse PCA and capture some gene modules with better biological interpretations. Results: We evaluated the performance of ESPCA using a set of artificial datasets and two real biological datasets (including TCGA pan-cancer expression data and ENCODE expression data), and compared their performance with PCA and sparse PCA. The results showed that ESPCA could identify more biologically relevant genes, improve their biological interpretations and reveal distinct sample characteristics.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111779", "output": "\"Deep Gender Classification of Spine X-Rays: A Comparative Study of Sequential CNNs and Fine-Tuned DenseNet Models\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We expand previously introduced language Alog with aggregates by allowing infinite sets and several additional set related constructs useful for knowledge representation and teaching. In addition, we propose an alternative formalization of the original VCP and incorporate it into the semantics of new language, Slog(+), which allows more liberal construction of sets and their use in programming rules. We show that, for programs without disjunction and infinite sets, the formal semantics of aggregates in Slog(+) coincides with that of several other known languages. Their intuitive and formal semantics, however, are based on quite different ideas and seem to be more involved than that of Slog(+).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111781", "output": "\"Efficient Streaming Facility Location: A Polylogarithmic Space Framework for High-Dimensional Dynamic Geometric Streams\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We study the classical setting of dynamic geometric streams, where the clients are presented as a sequence of insertions and deletions of points in the grid $\\{1,ldots\\,\\Delta \\}^{d}$, and we focus on the high-dimensional regime, where the algorithm\u2019s space complexity must be polynomial (and certainly not exponential) in $d \\cdot \\log \\Delta$.We present a new algorithmic framework, based on importance sampling from the stream, for $O(1)$-approximation of the optimal cost using only poly $(d\\cdot\\log\\Delta)$ space. This framework is easy to implement in two passes, one for sampling points and the other for estimating their contribution. Over random-order streams, we can extend this to a one-pass algorithm by using the two halves of the stream separately. Our main result, for arbitrary-order streams, computes $O(d^{1.5})$-approximation in one pass by using the new framework but combining the two passes differently. This improves upon previous algorithms that either need space exponential in d or only guarantee $O(d\\cdot\\log^{2}\\Delta)$-approximation, and therefore our algorithms for high-dimensional streams are the first to avoid the $O(\\log\\Delta)$ factor in approximation that is inherent to the widely-used quadtree decomposition. Our improvement is achieved by employing a geometric hashing scheme that maps points in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into buckets of bounded diameter, with the key property that every point set of small-enough diameter is hashed into at most poly $(d)$ distinct buckets.Finally, we complement our results with a proof that every streaming 1.085-approximation algorithm requires space exponential in poly $(d \\cdot log \\Delta)$, even for insertion-only streams.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "111782", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\nClustering Social Web Users by Topic of Interest, Ontology-Assisted Topic Modeling, Latent Semantic Analysis-Based Topic Modeling, k-means Document Clustering, Quasi-Clique Algorithm, Hierarchical Topic Modeling, Automatic Tag", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Traditional approaches, such as latent semantic analysis-based topic modeling or k-means document clustering, run into issues when content is sparse, the number of existing topics is unknown and/or we seek topics that are hierarchical in nature. In this paper, we propose a method for ontology-assisted topic clustering, in which we map Social Web user content to ontological classes to overcome sparsity. Using a novel ranking technique for calculating the topical similarity between individuals at different topic scopes, we construct graphs on which we apply a quasi-clique algorithm in order to find topic clusters at that scope, without having to pre-define a target number of topics. Our approach allows (1) the topic scope to be controlled in order to discover general or specific topics; (2) the automatic labeling of clusters with tags that are human and machine-understandable; and (3) graphs to be clustered recursively in order to generate a hierarchy of topics. The approach is evaluated against ground truths of Twitter users and the 20-newsgroups dataset, commonly used in document clustering research. We compare our approach to standard and Twitter-specific latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), hierarchical LDA, and standard and hierarchical k-means clustering. Results show that our method outperforms regular LDA by up to 24.7%, Twitter-LDA by up to 11.9%, and k-means by up to 26.7% on Social Web content. It performs equivalently, depending on several factors, to these approaches on a dataset of traditional documents. Additionally, our method can discover the appropriate number and composition of topics at a given topic scope, whereas k-means clustering cannot account for differences in scope.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.18}, {"id": "111783", "output": "\"Power-Efficient On-Chip Framebuffer Cache for Reduced Display System Power Consumption\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper proposes a power reduction technique for the on-chip framebuffer cache (FBC) performing a compressed image data management. The proposed architecture stores the compressed image data in the on-chip FBC, and the display controller decompresses the image data on the fly and sends it to the liquid crystal display panel. The compression and decompression processes incur additional power consumption but achieve lower system-wide power consumption. We implement the proposed architecture in a field-programmable gate array platform to confirm power saving by actual measurement. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed on-chip FBC significantly reduces the number of the off-chip framebuffer memory accesses and saves a large portion of the system-wide power consumption accordingly.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111784", "output": "Optimal Linear Combining for Wireless Relay Networks with Layered Video Bitstreams Using Hierarchical 16-QAM and QPSK Modulation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The relays are half-duplex and use the decode-and-forward protocol. The transmit source is a layered video bitstream, which can be partitioned into two layers, a base layer (BL) and an enhancement layer (EL), where the BL is more important than the EL in terms of the source distortion. The source broadcasts both layers to the relays and the destination using hierarchical 16-QAM. Each relay detects and transmits successfully decoded layers to the destination using either hierarchical 16-QAM or QPSK. The destination can thus receive multiple signals, each of which can include either only the BL or both the BL and the EL. We derive the optimal linear combining method at the destination, where the uncoded bit error rate is minimized. We also present a suboptimal combining method with a closed-form solution, which performs very close to the optimal. We use the proposed double-layer transmission scheme with our combining methods for transmitting layered video bitstreams. Numerical results show that the double-layer scheme can gain 2\u20132.5 dB in channel signal-to-noise ratio or 5\u20137 dB in video peak signal-to-noise ratio, compared with the classical single-layer scheme using conventional modulation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "111785", "output": "Robust Frequent Directions for Efficient Online Learning: A Regularization-Driven Approach to Addressing Rank Deficiency in Deterministic Sketching.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The conventional FD is a heuristic procedure that often outputs rank deficient matrices. To overcome the rank deficiency problem, we propose a new sketching strategy called robust frequent directions (RFD) by introducing a regularization term. RFD can be derived from an optimization problem. It updates the sketch matrix and the regularization term adaptively and jointly. RFD reduces the approximation error of FD without increasing the computational cost. We also apply RFD to online learning and propose an effective hyperparameter-free online Newton algorithm. We derive a regret bound for our online Newton algorithm based on RFD, which guarantees the robustness of the algorithm. The experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art second order online learning algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111786", "output": "\"Optimized Power Allocation and Mode Selection for Hybrid Coordinated Multi-Cell Transmission Systems with Limited Backhaul Capacity\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Coordinated Multi-Cell Transmission with Limited Backhaul Capacity\"\n\"Power Allocation and Mode Selection for Hybrid Coordinated Multi-Cell Systems\"\n\"Optimizing Power Consumption in Hybrid Co", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is a step towards virtualization-based, low-cost flexible and adaptable networking services. In the context of centralized baseband architectures, virtualization is already employed to run baseband processing units as software on top of conventional data center hardware. However, current virtualization solutions consider atomic virtualization, i.e., single virtual machines implementing all baseband functionalities. In this article, we propose the fine-grained virtualization of baseband processing to achieve a more flexible distribution of the processing workload in centralized architectures. We also evaluate the benefits of our approach in terms of: (i) The bandwidth requirements for each fine-grained distribution option, (ii) the latency experienced by mobile users for each fine-grained distribution option, and (iii) the total CPU usage of each fine-grained baseband processing function.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111788", "output": "Automated Synthesis of Reactive Systems from Rich Theories via Decidability of Existential-Universal Formulas", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Recently, a variety of approaches have been proposed to extend synthesis of reactive systems from propositional specifications towards specifications over rich theories. We propose a novel, completely automated approach to program synthesis which reduces the problem to deciding the validity of a set of for all there exists-formulas. In spirit of IC3/PDR, our problem space is recursively refined by blocking out regions of unsafe states, aiming to discover a fixpoint that describes safe reactions. If such a fixpoint is found, we construct a witness that is directly translated into an implementation. We implemented the algorithm on top of the JKIND model checker, and exercised it against contracts written using the Lustre specification language. Experimental results show how the new algorithm outperforms JKIND's already existing synthesis procedure based on k-induction and addresses soundness issues in the k-inductive approach with respect to unrealizable results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "111789", "output": "Temporal Logics for Model Checking: Bridging the Gap between Point-Based and Interval-Based Properties", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We introduce several improvements over previous approaches based on color and spatial reasoning exploiting Manhattan world priors. In particular, we introduce a new method for geometric context extraction based on a 3D facet representation, which combines color distribution analysis of individual images with sparse multi-view clues. We also introduce an efficient method to combine the facets from different viewpoints in a single consistent model, taking into the reliability of the facet information. The resulting capture and reconstruction pipeline automatically generates 3D multi-room environments in cases where most previous approaches fail, e.g., in the presence of hidden corners and large clutter, without the need for additional dense 3D data or tools. We demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of our approach on different real-world indoor scenes.

To overcome loss of data between mobile and fixed sensors due to crowd density, traditional approaches are extended with mobile-to-mobile proximity information. We tested our system in a museum crowded with thousands of visitors, showing that measurement accuracy increases in the presence of more individuals wearing a proximity sensor. Furthermore, we show that density information can be leveraged to study the behavior of the visitors, for example, to track the popularity of points of interest, and the flow and distribution of visitors across floors.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111792", "output": "Person Reidentification: A Cognitive Perspective on Appearance-Based and Discriminative Distance Metrics", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Fault diagnosis\u00a0techniques have\u00a0been proven as a good solution to improving and guaranteeing the reliability of critical unit. In this paper a fault diagnosis approach for fuel regulator of aircraft engine is developed. In the fault diagnosis strategy, a fuel regulator model is used to predict fuel flow according to engine controller command, an engine inverse model is built to precisely estimate the fuel flowing through the regulator, and the deviations among the regulator model output, engine inverse model output and feedback sensor measurement are used to detect and isolate regulator faults. Due to engine structure complexities and strong nonlinearity, it is very difficult to build exact mathematical engine inverse model. To tackle this problem, an emerging machine leaning technique, relevance vector machine, is adopted to construct the relationship between sensor readings and fuel consumption. Moreover, the proposed method is assessed by hardware-in-the-loop simulation test on an experiment platform. The experimental results verify the satisfying estimation accuracy of RVM-based engine inverse model and show that the developed fault diagnosis method for fuel regulator is effective and feasible, which is promising for fuel system reliability enhancement and aero-engine condition based maintenance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.17}, {"id": "111794", "output": "Hierarchical Key Assignment for Secure Access Control in Cloud-Based Systems with Dynamic Reading and Writing Privileges", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We propose a hierarchical key assignment (HKA) scheme RW-HKA that supports dynamic reading and writing privilege enforcement simultaneously. It not only provides typical confidentiality guarantee in data encryption, but also allows users to verify the integrity of encrypted data. It can be applied to cloud-based systems for providing flexible access control on encrypted data in the clouds. For security, we define the extended key indistinguishable (EKI) security for RW-HKA schemes. An EKI-secure RW-HKA scheme is resistant to collusion such that no subset of users can conspire to distinguish a data decryption key, that is not legally accessible, from random strings. In this paper, we provide a generic construction of EKI-secure RW-HKA schemes based on sID-CPA secure identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) and strong one-time signature schemes. Furthermore, we provide a new IBBE scheme that is suitable in constructing an efficient RW-HKA scheme with a constant number of user private keys, constant size of encrypted data, and constant computation cost of a user in deriving a key for decryption. It is the first HKA scheme that achieves the aforementioned performance while supporting dynamic reading and writing privilege enforcement simultaneously.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111795", "output": "Temporal Subspace Analysis for Robust Channel Estimation in Time-Division Duplex Multiple Antenna Systems Against Pilot Spoofing Attacks", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A pilot spoofing attack occurs when during the training phase, an adversary (spoofer) also sends identical training (pilot) signal as that of the legitimate receiver. This contaminates channel estimation and alters the legitimate precoder design, facilitating eavesdropping. A recent approach proposed superimposing a random sequence on the training sequence at the legitimate receivers, and then using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion to detect pilot spoofing attack via source enumeration. In this letter, we extend this approach by exploiting temporal subspace properties of the pilot signals in conjunction with the MDL criterion, to determine which pilots are contaminated by a spoofer, and which ones are free of spoofing attack. The identification performance is illustrated via simulations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.54}, {"id": "111796", "output": "\"Deep Structured Inference for Multiple Attribute Prediction: A Conditional Random Field Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Marginal Inference in Conditional Random Fields for Multi-Attribute Prediction with Deep Neural Networks\"\n\nor\n\n\"Structured Prediction in Deep Neural Networks for Multiple Attributes using Sum-Product Algorithm\"\n\nor\n\n\"Conditional Random Field-based Deep", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In attribute prediction, a common approach is to learn independent classifiers on top of a good feature representation. However, such classifiers assume conditional independence on features and do not explicitly consider the dependency between attributes in the inference process. We propose to formulate attribute prediction in terms of marginal inference in the conditional random field. We model potential functions by deep neural networks and apply the sum-product algorithm to solve for the approximate marginal distribution in feed-forward networks. Our message passing layer implements sparse pairwise potentials by a softplus-linear function that is equivalent to a higher-order classifier, and learns all the model parameters by end-to-end back propagation. The experimental results using SUN attributes and CelebA datasets suggest that the structured inference improves the attribute prediction performance, and possibly uncovers the hidden relationship between attributes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111797", "output": "\"Prioritizing Interaction Test Suites via Novel Dissimilarity Measures\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Prioritizing Test Cases with Dissimilarity Measures\"\n\"Evaluating Interaction Test Suites via Combinatorial Distance\"\n\"Combinatorial Prioritization of Test Suites using Dissimilarity Metrics\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We consider the problem of PIR with colluding databases and eavesdroppers, named ETPIR. Specifically, any T out of N databases may collude, that is, they may communicate their interactions with the user to guess the identity of the requested message. An eavesdropper is curious to know the content of the messages and can tap in on the incoming and outgoing transmissions of any E databases with the user. The databases share some common randomness unknown to the eavesdropper and the user, and use the common randomness to generate the answers, such that the eavesdropper can learn no information about the K messages. The capacity is defined as the maximum retrieval rate, i.e. the number of information bits of the desired message retrieved per downloaded bit. In our previous work [1], we found that when E >= T, the capacity equals 1 - E/N. In this work, we focus on the case when E <= T. We find an outer bound (converse bound) and an inner bound (achievability) on the optimal achievable rate. The gap between the derived inner and outer bounds vanishes as the number of messages K tends to infinity.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111800", "output": "\"Mitigating the Effects of False Alarms and Misdetections in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Continuous-Time Markov Chain Model\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Mitigating the Effects of False Alarms and Misdetections in Cognitive Radio Networks\", \"Spectrum Sensing Errors in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Markov", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Secondary users (SUs) perform sensing upon arrival to find an idle channel for transmission as well as during transmission to avoid interfering with primary users (PUs). In practice, spectrum sensing is not perfect and sensing errors including false alarms and misdetections are inevitable. In this paper, we develop a continuous-time Markov chain model to study the effect of false alarms and misdetections of SUs on several performance measures including the collision rate between PUs and SUs, the throughput of SUs and the SU delay in a CRN. Numerical results indicate that sensing errors can have a high impact on the performance measures.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111801", "output": "Private String Matching via Differentially-Private Linkage of Records with Synopsis Representation and Multi-Dimensional Embedding.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Several techniques solve private matching for numerical attributes, but they cannot handle well string-typed data. We propose a protocol for differentially-private linkage of records with string-valued attributes. String-valued data are partitioned into groups, and each partition is represented by a synopsis. Strings are first embedded into a metric space which preserves the relative distance among them, and then they are translated to multi-dimensional points. We propose two partitioning algorithms: the first one uses solely Lipschitz embedding coordinates, whereas the second one also leverages string length information.

At the same time, the openness of social media platforms provides opportunities to study how users share and discuss rumours, and to explore how to automatically assess their veracity, using natural language processing and data mining techniques. In this article, we introduce and discuss two types of rumours that circulate on social media: long-standing rumours that circulate for long periods of time, and newly emerging rumours spawned during fast-paced events such as breaking news, where reports are released piecemeal and often with an unverified status in their early stages. We provide an overview of research into social media rumours with the ultimate goal of developing a rumour classification system that consists of four components: rumour detection, rumour tracking, rumour stance classification, and rumour veracity classification. We delve into the approaches presented in the scientific literature for the development of each of these four components. We summarise the efforts and achievements so far toward the development of rumour classification systems and conclude with suggestions for avenues for future research in social media mining for the detection and resolution of rumours.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111803", "output": "\"Augmenting Spatial Awareness: Mid-Air Gestural Interaction for Retaining Visual Attention in Urban Environments\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this research, we aim at strengthening the connection between people and their surroundings through enabling mid-air gestural interaction with real-world landmarks and delivering information through audio to retain users\u2019 visual attention on the scene. Recent research on gesture-based and haptic techniques for such purposes has mainly considered handheld devices that eventually direct users\u2019 attention back to the devices. We contribute a hand-worn, mid-air gestural interaction design with directional vibrotactile guidance for finding points of interest (POIs). Through three design iterations, we address aspects of (1) sensing technologies and the placement of actuators considering users\u2019 instinctive postures, (2) the feasibility of finding and fetching information regarding landmarks without visual feedback, and (3) the benefits of such interaction in a tourist application. In a final evaluation, participants located POIs and fetched information by pointing and following directional guidance, thus realising a vision in which they found and experienced real-world landmarks while keeping their visual attention on the scene. The results show that the interaction technique has comparable performance to a visual baseline, enables high mobility, and facilitates keeping visual attention on the surroundings.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111804", "output": "Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP: Investigating the Impact of Time-Varying Video Quality on Human Visual Quality of Experience", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the computationally expensive convolution operations impose many challenges to the performance and scalability of CNNs. In parallel, photonic systems, which are traditionally employed for data communication, have enjoyed recent popularity for data processing due to their high bandwidth, low power consumption, and reconfigurability. Here we propose a Photonic Convolutional Neural Network Accelerator (PCNNA) as a proof of concept design to speedup the convolution operation for CNNs. Our design is based on the recently introduced silicon photonic microring weight banks, which use broadcast-and-weight protocol to perform Multiply And Accumulate (MAC) operation and move data through layers of a neural network. Here, we aim to exploit the synergy between the inherent parallelism of photonics in the form of Wavelength Division MUltiplexing (WDM) and sparsity of connections between input feature maps and kernels in CNNs. While our full system design offers up to more than 3 orders of magnitude speedup in execution time, its optical core potentially offer more than 5 order of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art electronic counterparts.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "111806", "output": "Decentralized Monitoring of Linear Temporal Logic Formulas via Taboue Construction and Round-Robin Communication Policies", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The tableau technique allows one to construct a semantic tree for the input LTL formula, which can be used to optimize the decentralized monitoring of LTL in various ways. Given a system P and an LTL formula \u03c6, we construct a tableau T\u03c6. The tableau T\u03c6 is used for two purposes: (a) to synthesize an efficient round-robin communication policy for processes, and (b) to find the minimal ways to decompose the formula and communicate observations of processes in an efficient way. In our framework, processes can propagate truth values of both atomic and compound formulas (non-atomic formulas) depending on the syntactic structure of the input LTL formula and the observation power of processes. We demonstrate that this approach of decentralized monitoring based on tableau construction is more straightforward, more flexible, and more likely to yield efficient solutions than alternative approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111807", "output": "\"Enterprise Cartography as a Framework for Organizational Dynamics: A Realization of Feedback Control Loops in the Observer and Modeller Components\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The artefacts of enterprise cartography represent the structure and dynamics of an organisation from three temporal views: as-was (past), as-is (present), and to-be (future). These views are dynamically generated from a continuous process that collects operational data from an organisation. This paper defines a set of enterprise cartography principles and provides an account of its role in understanding the dynamics of an organisation. The principles are grounded on control theory and are defined as a realisation of the observer and modeller components of the feedback control loop found on dynamic systems. As a result, an organisation can be abstracted as a dynamic system where a network of actors collaborate and produce results that can be depicted using cartographic maps.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111808", "output": "\"Improved Bounds for Computing Maximal $\\alpha$-Gapped Repeats in Strings\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our main result is the $O(\\alpha n)$ bound on the number of {\\em maximal} $\\alpha$-gapped repeats in a string of length $n$, previously proved to be $O(\\alpha^2 n)$ in (Kolpakov et al., 2013). For a closely related notion of maximal $\\delta$-subrepetition (maximal factors of exponent between $1+\\delta$ and $2$), our result implies the $O(n/\\delta)$ bound on their number, which improves the bound of (Kolpakov et al., 2010) by a $\\log n$ factor.   We also prove an algorithmic time bound $O(\\alpha n+S)$ ($S$ size of the output) for computing all maximal $\\alpha$-gapped repeats. Our solution, inspired by (Gawrychowski and Manea, 2015), is different from the recently published proof by (Tanimura et al., 2015) of the same bound. Together with our bound on $S$, this implies an $O(\\alpha n)$-time algorithm for computing all maximal $\\alpha$-gapped repeats.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "111809", "output": "\"Unveiling the Emergent Dynamics of Socio-Cognitive Technical Systems: A Framework for Modeling Second-Order Social Phenomena\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Unveiling the Dynamics of Socio-Cognitive Technical Systems\", \"A Framework for Modeling Second-Order Social Emergence\"]\n[\"Socio-Cognitive Technical", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We propose to model such phenomena as socio-cognitive technical systems that involve, on one hand, agents that are imbued with social rationality (thus socio-cognitive) and, on the other hand, a social space where they interact. For that modelling we rely on the WIT framework that defines such socio-cognitive technical systems as a trinity of aspects (the social phenomenon, the simulation model and the implementation of that model). In this paper we centre our attention on the use of affordances as a useful construct to model socio-cognitive technical systems. We use the example of reputation emergence to illustrate our proposal.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111810", "output": "\"Optical Properties of Two-Dimensional Cobalt-Permalloy Elliptical Dot Arrays Fabricated via Self-Aligned Shadow Deposition\"\n\nor \n\n\"Frequency-Dependent Brillouin Spectroscopy of Cobalt-Permalloy Elliptical Dot Arrays Prepared by Shadow Deposition\"\n\nor \n\n\"Self", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As such, a lot of attention has been devoted to the development of decoding algorithms with good error performance and efficient hardware implementation. One of the leading candidates in this regard is represented by successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding. However, its hardware implementation requires a large amount of memory. Recently, a partitioned SCL (PSCL) decoder has been proposed to significantly reduce the memory consumption [1]. In this paper, we examine the paradigm of PSCL decoding from both theoretical and practical standpoints: (i) by changing the construction of the code, we are able to improve the performance at no additional computational, latency or memory cost, (ii) we present an optimal scheme to allocate cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs), and (iii) we provide an upper bound on the list size that allows MAP performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111813", "output": "Continuous Top-k Spatial Keyword Queries for Moving Queries in Directed and Dynamic Road Networks: A Novel Approach for Efficient Processing and Validity Monitoring", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Several solutions have been proposed for top-k spatial keyword queries. However, most of the studies focus on Euclidean space or only investigate the snapshot queries where both the query and data object are static. A few algorithms study TkSk queries in undirected road networks where each edge is undirected and the distance between two points is the length of the shortest path connecting them. However, TkSk queries have not been thoroughly investigated in directed and dynamic spatial networks where each edge has a particular orientation and its weight changes according to the traffic conditions. Therefore, in this study, we address this problem by presenting a new method, called COSK, for processing continuous top-k spatial keyword queries for moving queries in directed and dynamic road networks. We first propose an efficient framework to process snapshot TkSK queries. Furthermore, we propose a safe-exit-based approach to monitor the validity of the results for moving TkSK queries. Our experimental results demonstrate that COSK significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of query processing time and communication cost.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111814", "output": "\"Amortized Search Bounds for GreedyASS: A Simplified Finger-Type Result\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To reduce these computations, this paper offers a solution that leverages a combination of runtime information and the algorithmic structure of CNNs. Specifically, in numerous modern CNNs, the outputs of compute-heavy convolution operations are fed to activation units that output zero if their input is negative. By exploiting this unique algorithmic property, we propose a predictive early activation technique, dubbed SnaPEA. This technique cuts the computation of convolution operations short if it determines that the output will be negative. SnaPEA can operate in two distinct modes, exact and predictive. In the exact mode, with no loss in classification accuracy, SnaPEA statically re-orders the weights based on their signs and periodically performs a single-bit sign check on the partial sum. Once the partial sum drops below zero, the rest of computations can simply be ignored, since the output value will be zero in any case. In the predictive mode, which trades the classification accuracy for larger savings, SnaPEA speculatively cuts the computation short even earlier than the exact mode. To control the accuracy, we develop a multi-variable optimization algorithm that thresholds the degree of speculation. As such, the proposed algorithm exposes a knob to gracefully navigate the trade-offs between the classification accuracy and computation reduction. Compared to a state-of-the-art CNN accelerator, SnaPEA in the exact mode, yields, on average, 28% speedup and 16% energy reduction in various modern CNNs without affecting their classification accuracy. With 3% loss in classification accuracy, on average, 67.8% of the convolutional layers can operate in the predictive mode. The average speedup and energy saving of these layers are 2.02X and 1.89X, respectively. The benefits grow to a maximum of 3.59X speedup and 3.14X energy reduction. Compared to static pruning approaches, which are complimentary to the dynamic approach of SnaPEA, our proposed technique offers up to 63% speedup and 49% energy reduction across the convolution layers with no loss in classification accuracy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111817", "output": "Event-Triggered Observer Design for One-Sided Lipschitz Nonlinear Systems with Disturbances Under Limited Communication Resources: A Sampled Signal and Dynamic Function Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To reduce the supervision time, a discrete-time event-triggering mechanism (DETM) is proposed in accordance with sampled signals (SSs) and a dynamic function, which not only significantly reduces the utilization of communication resources but also maintains the desired system performance. Then, by resorting to an input-delay protocol, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the state observer can availably estimate the state of the system. An illustrative example is provided to verify the merit of the achieved strategy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "111818", "output": "Self-Translation Network Embedding: A Novel Sequence-to-Sequence Model for Learning Node Embeddings in Complex Networks", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Such dense vector representations offer great promises for many network analysis problems. However, existing NE approaches are still faced with challenges posed by the characteristics of complex networks in real-world applications. First, for many real-world networks associated with rich content information, previous NE methods tend to learn separated content and structure representations for each node, which requires a post-processing of combination. The empirical and simple combination strategies often make the final vector suboptimal. Second, the existing NE methods preserve the structure information by considering short and fixed neighborhood scope, such as the first- and/or the second-order proximities. However, it is hard to decide the scope of the neighborhood when facing a complex problem. To this end, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence model based NE framework which is referred to as Self-Translation Network Embedding (STNE) model. With the sequences generated by random walks on a network, STNE learns the mapping that translates each sequence itself from the content sequence to the node sequence. On the one hand, the bi-directional LSTM encoder of STNE fuses the content and structure information seamlessly from the raw input. On the other hand, high-order proximity can be flexibly learned with the memories of LSTM to capture long-range structural information. By such self-translation from content to node, the learned hidden representations can be adopted as node embeddings. Extensive experimental results based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed STNE outperforms the state-of-the-art NE approaches. To facilitate reproduction and further study, we provide Internet access to the code and datasets\\footnotehttp://dm.nankai.edu.cn/code/STNE.rar.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "111819", "output": "Two-Phase Multipath (TPM) Forwarding Scheme for Public Clouds: A Novel Approach to Enhance Network Throughput in Multipath Proposals", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we propose the Two-Phase Multipath (TPM) forwarding scheme for public clouds. The proposal improves tenants network throughput, whereas keeping unmodified network stack on tenants. Our scheme is composed of a smart offline configuration phase that discover optimal disjoint paths, and a fast online path selection phase that improves flow throughput at run time. A logically centralized manager uses a genetic algorithm to generate and install sets of paths, summarized into trees, during multipath configuration, and a local controller performs the multipath selection based on network usage. We analyze TPM for different workloads and topologies under several scenarios of usage database locations and update policies. The results show that our proposal yields up to 77% throughput gains over previously proposed approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "111820", "output": "Privacy-Preserving Multisubset Data Aggregation for Smart Grids: A Novel Approach to Fine-Grained Demand Forecasting", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While these agents are effective at maximizing rewards, it is often unclear what strategies they use to do so. In this paper, we take a step toward explaining deep RL agents through a case study in three Atari 2600 environments. In particular, we focus on understanding agents in terms of their visual attentional patterns during decision making. To this end, we introduce a method for generating rich saliency maps and use it to explain 1) what strong agents attend to 2) whether agents are making decisions for the right or wrong reasons, and 3) how agents evolve during the learning phase. We also test our method on non-expert human subjects and find that it improves their ability to reason about these agents. Our techniques are general and, though we focus on Atari, our long-term objective is to produce tools that explain any deep RL policy.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111822", "output": "\"Footnotes to the Fountainhead: Revisiting the Classical Roots of Modern Philosophy\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To apply retrospective cost adaptive control to the generic transport model, a collection of control architectures is defined, where each architecture has a decentralized adaptation structure in the sense that a performance (error) variable is assigned to each control channel for online decentralized adaptation. Sensor signals may be shared among the channels to account for channel coupling. Then, a series of cases that examine the performance of retrospective cost adaptive control under various conditions is considered, including trim finding, startup, unknown time-varying aircraft dynamics (such as icing and mass variation), unknown flight envelope (including the possibility of conflicting commands), known sensing constraints (a failed air data system), known actuation constraints (requiring differential thrust), unknown sensor failure (stuck and biased airspeed measurement), and unknownactuator failure (severe stroke and rate saturation, dead zone, and jam). For each case, a range of scenarios is considered that captures various commands and performance objectives. Disturbance rejection is included in the form of unknown wind shear.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "111824", "output": "\"Secure Key Agreement on Constrained Devices via Dynamic Elliptic Curve Groups\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For such applications it thus offers an alternative to long term usage of standardized or otherwise pre-generated elliptic curve parameters, obtaining security against cryptographic attacks aimed at other users, and eliminating the need to trust elliptic curves generated by third parties.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.34}, {"id": "111825", "output": "Evaluating Rationality in Judicial Decision-Making: A Novel Metric for Case Misjudgment Detection", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A novel metric, judgment deviation, is proposed to measure the likelihood of a certain case's misjudgment according to the judgment results of its similar cases. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM) model to implement case modeling by extracting the feature vector based on the key factors that affect the judicial decision. Experiments on a real dataset including about 25,000 judgments of theft cases and artificial validation demonstrate that the results of the proposed evaluation approach conform to reality.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "111826", "output": "Evaluating the Feasibility of Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications in Massive Access Networks for 6G", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A parametric model is not required because it directly utilizes the frequency response of the closed-loop system, which can be measured accurately. This frequency-shaping approach enables the tradeoff between the quality of model-matching and the size of control efforts by adjusting weighting filters. Time domain specifications can be specified indirectly by approximating them in the frequency domain. The procedure is intuitively simple for SISO systems. Generalization for MIMO systems is possible by formulating convex optimization problems. A feedforward filter is designed and implemented on a nanopositioning system for semiconductor manufacturing, to improve its transient response.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "111828", "output": "\"Automated Task Granularity Optimization for Efficient Pipelined Stencil Applications\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

By storing parts of the popular files at the mobile users, users can locate some of their requested files in their own caches or the caches at their neighbors. In the latter case, when a user receives files from its neighbors, device-to-device (D2D) communication is performed. The D2D communication underlaid with cellular networks is also a new paradigm for the upcoming wireless systems. By allowing a pair of adjacent D2D users to communicate directly, D2D communication can achieve higher throughput, better energy efficiency, and lower traffic delay. In this paper, we propose an efficient learning-based caching algorithm operating together with a non-parametric estimator to minimize the average transmission delay in D2D-enabled cellular networks. It is assumed that the system does not have any prior information regarding the popularity of the files, and the non-parametric estimator is aimed at learning the intensity function of the file requests. An algorithm is devised to determine the best 'files,user' pairs that provide the best delay improvement in each loop to form a caching policy with very low-transmission delay and high throughput. This algorithm is also extended to address a more general scenario, in which the distributions of fading coefficients and the values of system parameters potentially change over time. Via numerical results, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing it with a naive algorithm, in which all users simply cache their favorite files, and by comparing with a probabilistic algorithm, the users cache a file with a probability that is proportional to its popularity.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.17}, {"id": "111830", "output": "Using the provided similar abstract-title pairs, I notice that they often feature phrases like \"visual representation\" and \"semantic visual navigation.\" Based on this, I would suggest the following title:\n\n\"Visual Representation Learning for Autonomous Agents in Semantic Visual Navigation\"\n\nIf I receive additional features, I may adjust this title to better reflect my", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We address this question in the context of semantic visual navigation, which is the problem of a robot finding its way through a complex environment to a target object, e.g. go to the refrigerator. Instead of acquiring a metric semantic map of an environment and using planning for navigation, our approach learns navigation policies on top of representations that capture spatial layout and semantic contextual cues. We propose to using high level semantic and contextual features including segmentation and detection masks obtained by off-the-shelf state-of- the-art vision as observations and use deep network to learn the navigation policy. This choice allows using additional data, from orthogonal sources, to better train different parts of the model the representation extraction is trained on large standard vision datasets while the navigation component leverages large synthetic environments for training. This combination of real and synthetic is possible because equitable feature representations are available in both (e.g., segmentation and detection masks), which alleviates the need for domain adaptation. Both the representation and the navigation policy can be readily applied to real non-synthetic environments as demonstrated on the Active Vision Dataset [1]. Our approach gets successfully to the target in 54% of the cases in unexplored environments, compared to 46% for non-learning based approach, and 28% for the learning-based baseline.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111831", "output": "\"Single Frequency Filtering for Robust Fundamental Frequency Extraction in Degraded Speech Signals\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The SFF of frequency-shifted speech signal gives high signal-to-noise ratio SNR segments at some frequencies and hence the SFF approach can be exploited for fo extraction using autocorrelation function of those segments. Since the fo is computed from the envelope of a single frequency component of the signal, the vocal tract resonances do not affect the fo extraction. The use of the high SNR frequency component in a given segment helps in overcoming the effects of degradations in the speech signal, without explicitly estimating the characteristics of noise. The proposed method of fo extraction is shown to give better performance for several types of real and simulated degradations, in comparison with some of the methods reported recently in the literature.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "111832", "output": "Optimizing Model Synchronization Frequency for Efficient Distributed Support Vector Machines in Stochastic Gradient Descent-Based Algorithms.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The communication time to do the model synchronization across the parallel processes is the main bottleneck that causes inefficiency in the training process. The model synchronization is directly affected by the mini-batch size of data processed before the global synchronization. In producing an efficient distributed model, the communication time in training model synchronization has to be as minimum as possible while retaining a high testing accuracy. The effect from model synchronization frequency over the convergence of the algorithm and accuracy of the generated model must be well understood to design an efficient distributed model. In this research, we identify the bottlenecks in model synchronization in parallel stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based SVM algorithm with respect to the training model synchronization frequency (MSF). Our research shows that by optimizing the MSF in the data sets that we used, a reduction of 98% in communication time can be gained (16x - 24x speed up) with respect to high-frequency model synchronization. The training model optimization discussed in this paper guarantees a higher accuracy than the sequential algorithm along with faster convergence.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111833", "output": "\"Accelerating Weighted Least Squares via Single Precision and Low Power Architectures\"\n\nor\n\n\"Reducing Computational Costs in WLS via Single Precision and ARMv7-based Architectures\"\n\nor\n\n\"Single Precision and Low Power Strategies for Efficient WLS on ARMv7 Architectures\"\n\nor\n\n\"Efficient Weight", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As a test case, we design an IIR filter for a Graphic Equalizer, where the numerical errors due to single precision are easily visualized. In addition, given the importance of low power architectures for this kind of implementations, we evaluate the performance, scalability, and energy efficiency of each method on two different processors implementing the ARMv7 architecture, widely used in current mobile devices with power constraints. Results show that the method that exhibits a high theoretical computational cost overcomes in efficiency other methods with lower theoretical cost in architectures of this type.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111834", "output": "\"Identifiability Concerns in Lumped-Parameter Models of the Cardiovascular System: A Study on Practically Available Parameters\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A nonlinear model-based predictive controller is then designed based on the proposed fuzzy model. The asymptotic stability of the approach is derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. A number of simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method for the synchronization of two uncertain fractional-order time-delay identical and nonidentical chaotic systems. The proposed control strategy is also employed for high-performance position control of a hydraulic actuator. In this example, the nonlinear mechanical model of the hydraulic actuator, instead of a mathematical model, is simulated. The example demonstrates that the proposed control strategy can be applied to a wide class of nonlinear systems.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "111836", "output": "Based on the provided abstract, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Representing Fuzzy Choquet Integral via Multilayer Networks for Explainable Neural Fusion\"\n\nUsing the provided similar abstract-title pairs:\n\n<similarpairs>\n  \"Representing Fuzzy Integral via Multilayer Networks for Explainable Neural Fusion\"\n  \"F", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Fusion occurs at many levels, ranging from the low-level combination of signals to the high-level aggregation of heterogeneous decision-making processes. While the last decade has witnessed an explosion of research in deep learning, fusion in neural networks has not observed the same revolution. Specifically, most neural fusion approaches are ad hoc, are not understood, are distributed versus localized, and/or explainability is low (if present at all). Herein, we prove that the fuzzy Choquet integral (ChI), a powerful nonlinear aggregation function, can be represented as a multilayer network, referred to hereafter as ChIMP. We also put forth an improved ChIMP (iChIMP) that leads to a stochastic-gradient-descent-based optimization in light of the exponential number of ChI inequality constraints. An additional benefit of ChIMP/iChIMP is that it enables explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Synthetic validation experiments are provided, and iChIMP is applied to the fusion of a set of heterogeneous architecture deep models in remote sensing. We show an improvement in model accuracy, and our previously established XAI indices shed light on the quality of our data, model, and its decisions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111837", "output": "\"Amplifying End-User Voices in Participatory Design: A Novel Online Tool for Data Analysis and Automation\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Participatory Design (PD) activities are aimed at making user voices heard by actively including end-users in the design process. Traditional paper- and prop-based PD methods have shortcomings, especially when it comes to a distributed project and evaluation setting. To address them there exist several software solutions to support the gathering of user ideas, for example PDotCapturer. However, software support for the task of analysing the gathered data, which becomes necessary in a `fast and furious' PD setting, is lacking. To address this issue we have been motivated to create an online tool for designers called PDotAnalyser. This tool was evaluated in three studies involving novice and expert designers. The results show that PDotAnalyser is a good addition to the toolbox of designers, who, nevertheless, would benefit from more support given by additional automation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.65}, {"id": "111838", "output": "Reconstructing the shape of a 3D object from multi-view images under unknown, general illumination is a fundamental problem in computer vision.

Each layer in a capsule network contains many capsules [a group of capsules forms a capsule layer and can be used in place of a traditional layer in a neural net]. We describe a version of capsules in which each capsule has a logistic unit to represent the presence of an entity and a 4x4 matrix which could learn to represent the relationship between that entity and the viewer (the pose). A capsule in one layer votes for the pose matrix of many different capsules in the layer above by multiplying its own pose matrix by trainable viewpoint-invariant transformation matrices that could learn to represent part-whole relationships. Each of these votes is weighted by an assignment coefficient. These coefficients are iteratively updated for each image using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm such that the output of each capsule is routed to a capsule in the layer above that receives a cluster of similar votes. The transformation matrices are trained discriminatively by backpropagating through the unrolled iterations of EM between each pair of adjacent capsule layers. On the smallNORB benchmark, capsules reduce the number of test errors by 45% compared to the state-of-the-art. Capsules also show far more resistance to white box adversarial attack than our baseline convolutional neural network.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111840", "output": "\"Assessing the Feasibility of Speech-to-Text Recognition in Enhancing Language Acquisition for Non-Native English Speakers: A Comparative Study\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, just like all other metaheuristics, DE also has some drawbacks, such as slow and/or premature convergence. This paper proposes a new subset-to-subset selection operator to improve the convergence performance of DE by randomly dividing target and trial populations into several subsets and employing the ranking-based selection operator among corresponding subsets. The proposed framework gives more survival opportunities to trial vectors with better objective function values. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of the original DE algorithm and several state-of-the-art DE variants on a series of benchmark functions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.02}, {"id": "111842", "output": "\"Designing a Virtual Learning Platform: Integrating Autonomous and Evaluation Modules for Enhanced Flexibility\"\n\nor\n\n\"Building a Flexible Virtual Classroom: A Proposal for Autonomous and Evaluation Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"Virtual Learning Platform with Autonomous and Evaluation Modules for Adaptive Learning\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This work develops an analytical formulation for large-scale failure and recovery of power distribution induced by severe weather. A focus is on incorporating pertinent characteristics of topological network structures into spatial temporal modeling. Such characteristics are new notations as dynamic failure- and recovery-neighborhoods. The neighborhoods quantify correlated failures and recoveries due to topology and types of components in power distribution. The resulting model is a multi-scale non-stationary spatial temporal random process. Dynamic resilience is then defined based on the model. Using the model and large-scale real data from Hurricane Ike, unique characteristics are identified: The failures follow the 80/20 rule where 74.3% of the total failures result from 20.7% of failure neighborhoods with up to 72 components \u201cfailed\u201d together. Thus the hurricane caused a large number of correlated failures. Unlike the failures, the recoveries follow 60/90 rule: 59.3% of recoveries resulted from 92.7% of all neighborhoods where either one component alone or two together recovered. Thus about 60% recoveries were uncorrelated and required individual restorations. The failure and recovery processes are further studied through the resilience metric to identify the least resilient regions and time durations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111844", "output": "Interaction Effects of Voice, Movement, and Appearance on Robot Embodiment in a Pedagogical Setting: Perceived Lifelikeness and Politeness", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A study is presented here that investigates whether there is an interaction effect between voice and other aspects of embodiment, such as movement and appearance, in a pedagogical setting. An on-line study was distributed to children aged 11-17 that uses a modified Godspeed questionnaire. We show an interaction effect between the robot embodiment and voice in terms of perceived lifelikeness of the robot. Politeness is a key strategy used in learning and teaching, and here an effect is also observed for perceived politeness. Interestingly, participants' overall preference was for embodiment combinations that are deemed polite and more like a teacher, but are not necessarily the most lifelike. From these findings, we are able to inform the design of robotic tutors going forward.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.59}, {"id": "111845", "output": "Understanding socio-economic dynamics in MMORPGs: Exploring the intersections of social interactions and economic activities in Aion's virtual economy.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we model the socio-economic system of an Aion, a popular MMORPG, as a multi-layer graph. Using the dataset consisting of 94,870 users and their activity records spanning three months, we examine how economic activities are associated with social interactions, and find that social interactions like participating in a party or exchanging messages are highly correlated with the trade activities. We also find that virtual economy in Aion is heavily inclined to a small number of upper-class userswho play a crucial role in virtual economy. Our analysis on the upper-class users reveals that a significant portion of them reach at the max-level and tend to either (i) have many social interactions with others or (ii) play extremely much time with no social activity. We also reveal that there are some low-level upper-class users who gain much money but hardly socialize with others. Lastly, we show how upper-class users who are at low-levels, play the game extremely much more than others, or rarely interact with other users, are associated with the Real Money Trade (RMT), which may be an illegal behavior that gathers in-game money for exchanging into real-world money. We reveal that more than half of total money exchanged through the trade are associated with the upper-class users who involve in the RMT.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111846", "output": "\"Real-Time Adaptive Control for Islanded Microgrids: A Game-Theoretic Approach to Robust Stability in the Presence of Disturbances\"\n\nor\n\n\"Microgrid Stability Enhancement via Critic Neural Networks: A Novel Game-Theoretic Framework for Adaptive Learning Control\"\n\nor\n\n\"Robust Adaptive Control of Island", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although companies expect early contributions, new hires often take several weeks to reach the same productivity level as existing employees. We refer to this transition of new hires from novices to experts as ramp-up journey. There can be various factors such as lack of technical skills or lack of familiarity with the process that influence the ramp-up journey of new hires. The goal of our work is to identify those factors and study their influence on the ramp-up journey. We expect the results from this study to help identify the need of various types of assistance to new hires to ramp-up faster. As a first step towards our goal, this paper explores the impact of two strategic practices, namely distributed development and internship on the ramp-up journey of new hires. Our results show that new hires in proximity to the core development team and new hires with prior internship experience perform better than others in the beginning. In the overall ramp-up journey, the effect of the two factors attenuates, yet nevertheless better compared to their counterparts. Product teams can use this information to pay special attention to non-interns and use better tools for distributed, cooperative work to help new hires ramp-up faster.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111848", "output": "\"Optimizing the Integration of Emerging Storage-Class Memory with 3D Stacked DRAM Caches for High-Performance and Cost-Effective Servers\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Nevertheless, the latency-sensitive nature of memory-resident services makes seamless integration of SCM in servers questionable. In this paper, we ask the question of how best to introduce SCM for such servers to improve overall performance/cost over existing DRAM-only architectures. We first show that even with the most optimistic latency projections for SCM, the higher memory access latency results in prohibitive performance degradation. However, we find that deployment of a modestly sized high-bandwidth 3D stacked DRAM cache makes the performance of an SCM-mostly memory system competitive. The high degree of spatial locality that memory-resident services exhibit not only simplifies the DRAM cache's design as page-based, but also enables the amortization of increased SCM access latencies and the mitigation of SCM's read/write latency disparity.We identify the set of memory hierarchy design parameters that plays a key role in the performance and cost of a memory system combining an SCM technology and a 3D stacked DRAM cache. We then introduce a methodology to drive provisioning for each of these design parameters under a target performance/cost goal. Finally, we use our methodology to derive concrete results for specific SCM technologies. With PCM as a case study, we show that a two bits/cell technology hits the performance/cost sweet spot, reducing the memory subsystem cost by 40% while keeping performance within 3% of the best performing DRAM-only system, whereas single-level and triple-level cell organizations are impractical for use as memory replacements.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "111849", "output": "Eigenmode Selection for Low-Complexity Relay Precoding in Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems: Exploiting Condition Number Properties for Reduced Search Complexity", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although this method can achieve close-to-optimal performance, it would involve high search complexity for the solution in a relay precoding set of size 2.M!, where M is the degrees of freedom of the MIMO relay system. In this paper, we propose low-complexity relay precoder designs based on eigenmode selection for two-way AF MIMO relay systems. We first exploit the properties of condition numbers of the effective MIMO channels, and then present two set-reduction methods accordingly for eigenmode-selection precoding to minimize/maximize the sum of condition numbers. As compared with the original eigenmode-selection precoding scheme, the proposed designs reach similar performance but reduce the search complexity by a factor of M(M-1).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "111850", "output": "\"Real-Time Volumetric Media Streaming: Optimizing Bandwidth and Latency for Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Applications\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As in video streaming, hologram streaming must support network adaptivity and fast startup, but must also handle large bandwidths, multiple simultaneously streaming objects, and frequent user interaction, which requires a low delay. In this paper, we introduce the first system to our knowledge designed specifically for streaming volumetric media. The system reduces bandwidth by introducing 3D tiles and culling them or reducing their level of detail depending on their relation to the user\u2019s view frustum and distance to the user. Our system reduces latency by introducing a window-based buffer, which in contrast to a queue-based buffer allows insertions near the head of the buffer rather than only at the tail of the buffer, to respond quickly to user interaction. To allocate bits between different tiles across multiple objects, we introduce a simple greedy yet provably optimal algorithm for rate-utility optimization. We introduce utility measures based not only on the underlying quality of the representation, but on the level of detail relative to the user\u2019s viewpoint and device resolution. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides a superior quality compared with the existing video-streaming approaches adapted to hologram streaming, in terms of utility and user experience over variable, throughput-constrained networks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111851", "output": "Robust Image Filtering via Adaptive Exponent Driven Regularization for Salient Feature Preservation\n\n<similarpairs>\nRobust Image Filtering via Adaptive Exponent Driven Regularization for Salient Feature Preservation, Robust Image Smoothing Techniques Using Adaptive Exponent Driven Regularization, Adaptive Exponent Driven Regularization for Image", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Compared with traditional trades, e-commerce trading provides users with rich information and comments on the products and vendors, albeit sometimes bedevilled with false and fallacious information. Based on this observation, the dedicated e-commerce creditworthiness model is supposed to incorporate online comments while overcoming the effects of such fallacious information. The objective is to provide e-commerce participants with authentic, reliable descriptions of the vendors and their products. The authors have proposed a dedicated creditworthiness model and cloud service for e-commerce. The basic principle of the creditworthiness service is to register the basic description of products and vendors for authenticity, collect online and professional comments for reliability, and calculate the certified credentials or certificates for ability or quality. This article provides a technical framework for e-commerce creditworthiness. The creditworthiness models, algorithms, and tools are discussed.

The applications include climbing and perching robots. Surfaces are characterized in terms of asperity distributions, which lead to stochastic models of spine force capabilities over a range of loading directions. Models cover unidirectional spine arrays and pairs of opposed arrays that withstand normal forces pulling away from a surface. Experiments on a variety of surfaces confirm the predicted behavior. For opposed spine arrays, the overall load capability also depends on the preloading strategy for applying internal forces. Insights from the analysis guide the design of spine array mechanisms to allow, for example, a small aerial platform to attach to walls and ceilings.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "111854", "output": "Improving Accuracy in Large Sparse Datasets: A Comparative Study of Linear Classifiers Under Different Missing Mechanisms", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For the scalability reason, linear classifiers are preferred in classification tasks on such datasets. Our previous work Li et\u00a0al. (2016) has studied how sparsity affects naive Bayes classification under typical data missing mechanisms. In this paper, we greatly expand our previous work by including all linear classifiers, and explore practical strategies to improve accuracy of large sparse data classification. Using real-world and synthetic experiments, we observe different learning curve behaviors under different missing mechanisms. We also study the theoretic reasons for all our observations. Our studies provide a practical guideline to determine if or when obtaining more data and/or obtaining missing values in the data is worthwhile or not. This can be very valuable in the recommendation system applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111855", "output": "\"Coarse-Grained Path Ratings for Scalable Network Inference: Leveraging Matrix Factorization for Efficient and Informative Network Measurement\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Compared to fine-grained measurements, coarse-grained ratings are appealing in that they are not only informative but also cheap to obtain. Motivated by this insight, we first address the scalable acquisition of path ratings by statistical inference. By observing similarities to recommender systems, we examine the applicability of solutions to a recommender system and show that our inference problem can be solved by a class of matrix factorization techniques. A technical contribution is an active and progressive inference framework that not only improves the accuracy by selectively measuring more informative paths, but also speeds up the convergence for available bandwidth by incorporating its measurement methodology. Then, we investigate the usability of rating-based network measurement and inference in applications.

For identifying and evaluating the usefulness of different kinds of patterns, many techniques/constraints have been proposed, such as support, confidence, sequence order, and utility parameters (e.g., weight, price, profit, quantity, etc.). In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for utility-oriented pattern mining (UPM). UPM is a vital task, with numerous high-impact applications, including cross-marketing, e-commerce, finance, medical, and biomedical applications. This survey aims to provide a general, comprehensive, and structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods of UPM. First, we introduce an in-depth understanding of UPM, including concepts, examples, and comparisons with related concepts. A taxonomy of the most common and state-of-the-art approaches for mining different kinds of high-utility patterns is presented, including Apriori-based, tree-based, projection-based, vertical-/horizontal-data-format-based, and other hybrid approaches. A comprehensive review of advanced topics of existing high-utility pattern mining techniques is offered, with a discussion of their pros and cons. Finally, we present several well-known open-source software packages for UPM. We conclude our survey with a discussion on open and practical challenges in this field.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111857", "output": "\"Integrating Software Agents and Workflow Management: A Petri Net Construct for Enhanced Modelling Capabilities\"\n\nor \n\n\"Workflow and Multi-Agent Systems Convergence: The Agent Activity Paradigm\"\n\nor \n\n\"Activity-Based Modelling of Inter-Organizational Systems: A Novel Petri Net Approach\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Among the most prominent of these approaches is TCT-ColBERT, which trains a light-weight \"student'' model from a more expensive \"teacher'' model. In this work, we take a closer look into TCT-ColBERT concerning its reproducibility and replicability. To structure our study, we propose a three-stage perspective on reproducing the training, inference, and evaluation of model-focused papers, each using artefacts produced from different stages in the pipeline. We find that --- perhaps as expected --- precise reproduction is more challenging when the complete training process is conducted, rather than just inference from a released trained model. Each stage provides the opportunity to perform replication and ablation experiments. We are able to replicate (i.e., produce an effective independent implementation) for model inference and dense indexing/retrieval, but are unable to replicate the training process. We conduct several ablations to cover gaps in the original paper, and make the following observations: (1) the model can function as an inexpensive re-ranker, establishing a new Pareto-optimal result; (2) the index size can be reduced by using lower-precision floating point values, but only if ties in scores are handled appropriately; (3) training needs to be conducted for the entire suggested duration to achieve optimal performance; and (4) student initialisation from the teacher is not necessary.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.17}, {"id": "111859", "output": "\"Designing a Comprehensive Framework for Multi-Level Similarity Comparison of Android Apps: A Case Study on Repackaged Applications\"\n\nor \n\n\"SimiDroid: A Scalable Prototype Tool for Pairwise Comparison of Android Apps in the Era of Repackaging\"\n\nor \n\n\"Revealing Repackaged App Similar", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Despite the existence of several approaches to improving the scalability of detecting repackaged/cloned apps, researchers and practitioners are eventually faced with the need for a comprehensive pairwise comparison (or simultaneously multiple app comparisons) to understand and validate the similarities among apps. In this work, we present the design and implementation of our research-based prototype tool called SimiDroid for multi-level similarity comparison of Android apps. SimiDroid is built with the aim to support the comprehension of similarities/changes among app versions and among repackaged apps. In particular, we demonstrate the need and usefulness of such a framework based on different case studies implementing different dissection scenarios for revealing various insights on how repackaged apps are built. We further show that the similarity comparison plugins implemented in SimiDroid yield more accurate results than the state of the art.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111860", "output": "\"Adapting Pretrained Models for Transfer Learning: A Comparative Study of Fine-Tuning and Feature Extraction Across Diverse NLP Tasks\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We start by analyzing a dataset of over 4M cell tower locations in the US. We evaluate the geographic characteristics of deployments and highlight how locations correspond to population density in major metropolitan areas and in rural areas. We also show how deployments have been arranged along highways throughout the US. Our analysis highlight areas where new deployments would be warranted.

As the fast growth of various global services, there is an increasing need for big data analytics across multiple data centers (DCs) located in different countries or regions. It asks for the support of a cross-DC data processing platform optimized for the geo-distributed computing environment. Although some recent efforts have been made for geo-distributed big data analytics, they cannot guarantee predictable job completion time, and would incur excessive traffic over the inter-DC network that is a scarce resource shared by many applications. In this paper, we study to minimize the inter-DC traffic generated by MapReduce jobs targeting on geo-distributed big data, while providing predicted job completion time. To achieve this goal, we formulate an optimization problem by jointly considering input data movement and task placement. Furthermore, we guarantee predictable job completion time by applying the chance-constrained optimization technique, such that the MapReduce job can finish within a predefined job completion time with high probability. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we conduct extensive simulations using real traces generated by a set of queries on Hive. The results show that our proposal can reduce 55 percent inter-DC traffic compared with centralized processing by aggregating all data to a single data center.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111863", "output": "\"Ant Colony Optimization for High-Order Graph Matching: A Novel Approach to NP-Hard Combinatorial Optimization Problems\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The major obstacles for the model transfer approach are two-fold: 1. Lexical features are not directly transferable across languages; 2. Target language-specific syntactic structures are difficult to be recovered. To address these two challenges, we present a novel representation learning framework for multi-source transfer parsing. Our framework allows multi-source transfer parsing using full lexical features straightforwardly. By evaluating on the Google universal dependency treebanks (v2.0), our best models yield an absolute improvement of 6.53% in averaged labeled attachment score, as compared with delexicalized multi-source transfer models. We also significantly outperform the state-of-the-art transfer system proposed most recently.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111865", "output": "Development of Partial Functions within Fuzzy Type Theory: Integrating Lapierre and Lepage's Contributions", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To remain coordinated and avoid conflicts, team members need to identify dependencies between their activities -- which though loosely coupled may interact--and share information appropriately. The loose-coupling of tasks increases the difficulty of identifying dependencies, with the result that team members often lack important information or are overwhelmed by irrelevant information. This paper formalizes a new multi-agent systems problem, Information Sharing in Loosely-Coupled Extended-Duration Teamwork (ISLET). It defines a new representation, Mutual Influence Potential Networks (MIP-Nets) and an algorithm, MIP-DOI, that uses this representation to determine the information that is most relevant to each team member. Importantly, because the extended duration of the teamwork precludes team members from developing complete plans in advance, the MIP-Nets approach, unlike prior work on information sharing, does not rely on a priori knowledge of a team's possible plans. Instead, it models collaboration patterns and dependencies among people and their activities based on team-member interactions. Empirical evaluations show that this approach is able to learn collaboration patterns and identify relevant information to share with team members.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111867", "output": "Constrained Subspace Estimation via Semidefinite Relaxation for Model-Based Applications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This constrained subspace estimation (CSE) problem arises in applications such as beamforming, where the model-based subspace encodes prior information about the direction-of-arrival of some sources impinging on the array. In this paper, we formulate the constrained subspace estimation (CSE) problem, and present an approximation based on a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) of this non-convex problem. The performance of the proposed CSE algorithm is demonstrated via numerical simulation, and its application to beamforming is also discussed.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "111868", "output": "Fast Learning to Downsample for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We also show that large scale pre-training is unnecessary. We thoroughly validate our metric in experiments with ImageNet pre-training and the coarse labeled data of Cityscapes.

Star queries aim to identify an entity given a set of related entities, and they are common with massive knowledge graphs. It is important to find the best way to answer star queries, and we can do this by treating it as a graph pattern-matching problem. Because knowledge graphs are noisy and incomplete in nature, we must find answers that match the star pattern closely, and extract a precise match if possible. Thus, here we propose GStar, a framework to identify the top-k best answers for a star query. GStar effectively and efficiently answers top-k star queries on billion-node graphs through a novel query model, an index-free query algorithm, and a distributed query system. We evaluate GStar through experiments on real-world knowledge graphs. Experimental results show that our query model effectively answers real-life star-pattern queries; our query algorithm can answer top-k queries in a near-real-time manner without requiring expensive graph indices; and the distributed system scales well with both the graph size and number of machines used for computation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111871", "output": "Robust Covariance Tensor-Based Angle Estimation for Bistatic MIMO Radar with Unknown Mutual Coupling and Spatial Colored Noise\n\nor\n\nNovel Covariance Tensor Method for Joint DOD and DOA Estimation in Bistatic MIMO Radar Systems with Mutual Coupling and Colored Noise\n\nor\n\nFourth", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In the proposed method, a third-order tensor is firstly formulated for capturing the multidimensional nature of the received data. Then taking advantage of the temporal uncorrelated characteristic of colored noise and the banded complex symmetric Toeplitz structure of the mutual coupling matrices, a novel fourth-order covariance tensor is constructed for eliminating the influence of both spatial colored noise and mutual coupling. After a robust signal subspace estimation is obtained by using the higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) technique, the rotational invariance technique is applied to achieve the DODs and DOAs. Compared with the existing HOSVD-based subspace methods, the proposed method can provide superior angle estimation performance and automatically jointly perform the DODs and DOAs. Results from numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111872", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n1. \"Optimizing Search Advertising Revenue with Dynamic Cache Refresh\"\n2. \"Predictive Cache Refresh for Search Advertising Systems\"\n3. \"Reducing Revenue Loss through Intelligent Cache Refresh\"\n4. \"Machine Learning-based Cache", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These machine learning computations constitute a substantial part of the operating cost, e.g., 10% to 30% of the total gross revenues. It is desirable to cache and reuse previous computation results to reduce this cost, but caching introduces approximation which comes with potential revenue loss. To maximize cost savings while minimizing the overall revenue impact, an intelligent refresh policy is required to decide when to refresh the cached computation results. The state-of-the-art manually-tuned refresh heuristic uses revenue history to assign different refresh frequencies. Using the gradient boosting regression tree algorithm with well selected features, we introduce a rapid prediction framework that provides refresh decisions at higher accuracy compared to the heuristic. This enables us to build a prediction-based refresh policy and a cache achieving higher profit without manual parameter tuning. Simulations conducted on the logs from a major commercial search advertising system show that our proposed cache design reduces the negative revenue impact (0.07x), and improves the cost savings (1.41x) and the net profit (1.50~1.70x) compared to the state-of-the-art manually-tuned heuristic-based cache design.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111873", "output": "Dissipativity-Based Fuzzy Control for Nonlinear Dynamic Systems with Event-Triggered Mechanism and Stability Enhancement via Dissipativity Constraints", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

IoT has provided humans the capability to manipulate the operations and data available from different information systems using these intelligent objects available in the surroundings. The scope of IoT is to serve humanity across different domains of life covering industrial, health, home and day-to-day operations of Information Systems (IS). Due to the huge number of heterogeneous network elements interacting and working under IoT based information systems, there is an enormous need for resource management for the smooth running of IoT operations. The key aspect in IoT implementations is to have resource-constrained embedded devices and objects participating in IoT operations. It is important to meet the challenges raised during management and sharing of resources in IoT based information systems. Managing resources by implementing protocols, algorithms and techniques are required to enhance the scalability, reliability and stability in IoT operations across different fields of technology. This special issue opens the new areas of interest for the researchers in the domain of resource management in IoT operations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "111875", "output": "\"Rapid Composition of Cyber-Physical Systems through Real-Time Physical Service Modeling\"\n\nor alternatively\n\n\"Real-Time Physical Service Modeling for Timely Composition of Cyber-Physical Systems\"\n\nor \n\n\"Novel Models for Real-Time Physical Service Specification in Cyber-Physical Systems Composition\"\n\nor \n\n\"Physical Service Modeling for High-Dep", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Certain (combinations of) rules, however, can be handled much more efficiently using custom algorithms. To integrate such algorithms into a general reasoning approach that can handle arbitrary rules, we propose a modular framework for computing and maintaining a materialisation. We split a datalog program into modules that can be handled using specialised algorithms, and we handle the remaining rules using the seminaive algorithm. We also present two algorithms for computing the transitive and the symmetric-transitive closure of a relation that can be used within our framework. Finally, we show empirically that our framework can handle arbitrary datalog programs while outperforming existing approaches, often by orders of magnitude.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.31}, {"id": "111877", "output": ">High-Order Position Weight Matrices for Efficient Motif Matching with Sequence Variants\n>Efficient Motif Matching with High-Order Position Weight Matrices and Sequence Variants\n>Accelerating Motif Discovery with High-Order PWM and Sequence Variant Integration\n>Fast and Accurate Motif Matching Using High-", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

There has been lots of research of how to learn these models from training data but the problem of predicting putative sites of the learned motifs by matching the model against new sequences has been given less attention. Moreover, motif site analysis is often concerned about how different variants in the sequence affect the sites. So far, though, the corresponding efficient software tools for motif matching have been lacking. Results: We develop fast motif matching algorithms for the aforementioned tasks. First, we formalize a framework based on high-order position weight matrices for generic representation of motif models with dinucleotide or general q-mer dependencies, and adapt fast PWM matching algorithms to the high-order PWM framework. Second, we show how to incorporate different types of sequence variants, such as SNPs and indels, and their combined effects into efficient PWM matching workflows. Benchmark results show that our algorithms perform well in practice on genomesized sequence sets and are for multiple motif search much faster than the basic sliding window algorithm.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111878", "output": "\"Embedding Shapelet Diversity: A Unified Framework for Multivariate Time Series Classification\"\n\nor \n\n\"ShapeNet: A Novel Approach to Unifying Shapelet Selection for Multivariate Time Series Classification\"\n\nor \n\n\"Triplet Embeddings for Shapelet Selection: A Unified Space for Multivariate Time Series Classification\"\n\nor \n\n\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, existing work on shapelets selection cannot be applied to multivariate time series classification (MTSC) since the candidate shapelets of MTSC may come from different variables of different lengths and thus cannot be directly compared. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel model called ShapeNet, which embeds shapelet candidates of different lengths into a unified space for shapelet selection. The network is trained using cluster-wise triplet loss, which considers the distance between anchor and multiple positive (negative) samples and the distance between positive (negative) samples, which are important for convergence. We compute representative and diversified final shapelets rather than directly using all the embeddings for model building to avoid a large fraction of non-discriminative shapelet candidates. We have conducted experiments on ShapeNet with competitive state-of-the-art and benchmark methods using UEA MTS datasets. The results show that the accuracy of ShapeNet is the best of all the methods compared. Furthermore, we illustrate the shapelets' interpretability with two case studies.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111879", "output": "\"Reevaluating the Foundations of Multimodal Word Discovery: The Crucial Role of Alignment Mechanisms in Word-Level Representation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper treats the problem of control of a hexapod robot that has been developed in a collaborative project of the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Automation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. We derive the hexapod robot\u2019s kinematics and dynamics models, which are non-periodic, nonlinear, hybrid and open-loop unstable. In order to solve this challenge, we compute a transverse linearization about the desired motion which is a linear impulsive system. The real environment, where the robot performs tasks, are usually unstructured and dynamic, it is always difficult to know the size of obstacles the robot strikes on. In order to reduce its reliance on terrain information for locomotion control to the minimum, taking account of physical constraints, we propose a constrained model predictive controller for stabilization of non-periodic trajectories of the hexapod robot walking over irregular terrain. We prove the stability of the proposed controller theoretically. In the end we perform several simulations and experiments to verify the effectiveness of the control algorithm we proposed.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "111881", "output": "\"Multicultural Video Tagging: A Joint Embedding Approach for Culture-Specific Tag Assignment\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Multicultural Video Analysis\", \"Cross-Cultural Video Understanding\"]\n[\"Culture-Specific Video Tagging\", \"Cultural Preference-Based Video Annotation\"]\n[\"Joint Embedding for Multilingual Video Features\", \"Visual", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Contrary to the commonly used Manhattan world assumption, the horizontal directions in Atlanta world are not necessarily orthogonal to each other. While Atlanta world can encompass a wider range of scenes, this makes the search space much larger and the problem more challenging. Our input data is a set of surface normals, for example, acquired from RGB-D cameras or 3D laser scanners, as well as lines from calibrated images. Given this input data, we propose the first globally optimal method of inlier set maximization for Atlanta direction estimation. We define a novel search space for Atlanta world, as well as its parametrization, and solve this challenging problem using a branch-and-bound (BnB) framework. To alleviate the computational bottleneck in BnB, i.e., the bound computation, we present two bound computation strategies: rectangular bound and slice bound in an efficient measurement domain, i.e., the extended Gaussian image (EGI). In addition, we propose an efficient two-stage method which automatically estimates the number of horizontal directions of a scene. Experimental results with synthetic and real-world datasets have successfully confirmed the validity of our approach.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111883", "output": "Optimizing Process Replication Efficiency through Intra-Parallelization in Extreme Scale Supercomputing Environments", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

By default, the workload efficiency of replication is limited to 50% because of the additional resources that have to be used to execute the replicas of the application's processes. In this paper, we introduce intra-parallelization, a solution that avoids replicating all computation by introducing work-sharing between replicas. We show on a representative set of benchmarks that intra-parallelization allows achieving more than 50% efficiency without compromising fault tolerance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111884", "output": "\"Predicting Visual Attention Maps with Game States: A Novel Approach to Optimizing Bandwidth Allocation in Cloud Gaming\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To fulfill its goal of enabling anyone to play their favorite games whenever, wherever and on any device, it requires high bandwidth, which remains a major challenge. One solution is to model or predict the players' visual attention map and allocate bitrate accordingly, thereby reducing the bandwidth. The first step of this solution is to predict the players' visual attention maps, which is the objective of our work. In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that the predicted visual attention maps can be further improved by incorporating game state. Furthermore, we propose a game attention model based on game states. To evaluate the model, we have prepared a 92 minute dataset of states of three games. The results indicate that incorporating game states into visual attention models improves the accuracy of the predicted attention maps by 17.4% on average.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111885", "output": "\"Efficient Portfolio Optimization via Map-Reduce: A Genetic Algorithm Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Accelerating Group Stock Portfolio Mining with Map-Reduce and Genetic Algorithms\"\n\nor\n\n\"Speeding Up Portfolio Optimization through Map-Reduce and Genetic Algorithm Evolution\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In our previous approach, we proposed a method for mining a group stock portfolio that used grouping genetic algorithms. The derived group stock portfolio represents stocks in the same group that may have similar properties; consequently, a variety of stock portfolios could be offered to investors. However, the evaluation process used by this previous approach is time consuming when the number of stocks or groups increases. To address this problem, the map-reduce technique is considered. Map-reduce is a well-known approach for speeding up the mining process. This paper proposes a map-reduce-based approach to mine groups of stock portfolios and speed up the evolution process while still achieving results as similar as possible to the previous approach. Here, a chromosome represents a mapper number, a group number, a stock part and a portfolio part. Utilizing the mapper number, the chromosomes in a population are divided into subsets and sent to respective mappers, while the reducers execute fitness evaluation and genetic operations. The evolution process is repeated until the terminal conditions are reached. Finally, experiments on a real dataset are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.92}, {"id": "111886", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title.

But advertisers can be both sensitive to being viewed (brand awareness effect) and being clicked (conversion into sales). In this paper, we generalize the auction mechanism by including both pricing components: the advertisers are charged when their ad is displayed, and pay an additional price if the ad is clicked. Applying the results for Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves auctions, we show how to compute payments to ensure incentive compatibility from advertisers as well as maximize the total value extracted from the advertisement slot(s). We provide tight upper bounds for the loss of efficiency due to applying only pay-per-click (or pay-per-view) pricing instead of our scheme. Those bounds depend on the joint distribution of advertisement visibility and population likelihood to click on ads, and can help identify situations where our mechanism yields significant improvements. We also describe how the commonly used generalized second price auction can be extended to this context.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.88}, {"id": "111887", "output": "\"Rectangular Component Multipliers: A Novel Approach to Efficient Recursive Multiplication\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this work, the domain, the interaction framework and the executive system for the autonomous action execution are discussed.

Most social recommenders, however, are insufficient to capture the user preferences over items, as they largely neglect the multi-facet social relations latent in the social network, such as classmates, colleagues, and families. We, therefore, propose a novel disentangled social recommendation (DSR) framework to exploit the multifacet social relations for enhanced item recommendation. Specifically, DSR explicitly disentangles the social relations into multiple facets, and encodes the social influence under each facet into disentangled user embeddings in the social network. The multiple user embeddings are then aggregated via a facet-level attention mechanism, which distinguishes the effective facets for better inferring user interests over items. Extensive experiments show the superiority of DSR against the state-of-the-art methods and its potential in alleviating the data sparsity issue.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111890", "output": "Efficient Parallelism through Predictable Thread Creation: A Heartbeat Scheduling Technique for Arbitrary Nested-Parallel Programs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The problem could be considered solved in theory, but not in practice, because the overheads of creating and managing parallel threads can overwhelm their benefits. Developing efficient parallel codes therefore usually requires extensive tuning and optimizations to reduce parallelism just to a point where the overheads become acceptable. \n\n In this paper, we present a scheduling technique that delivers provably efficient results for arbitrary nested-parallel programs, without the tuning needed for controlling parallelism overheads. The basic idea behind our technique is to create threads only at a beat (which we refer to as the \"heartbeat\") and make sure to do useful work in between. We specify our heartbeat scheduler using an abstract-machine semantics and provide mechanized proofs that the scheduler guarantees low overheads for all nested parallel programs. We present a prototype C++ implementation and an evaluation that shows that Heartbeat competes well with manually optimized Cilk Plus codes, without requiring manual tuning.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "111891", "output": "Redirected Walking with Adaptation to Increased Curvature Gains in Immersive Virtual Environments", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Redirected walking (RDW) is a collection of techniques to solve this problem. One of these techniques aims to imperceptibly rotate the user's view of the virtual scene in order to steer her along a confined path whilst giving the impression of walking in a straight line in a large virtual space. Measurement of perceptual thresholds for the detection of such a modified curvature gain have indicated a radius that is still larger than most room sizes. Since the brain is an adaptive system and thresholds usually depend on previous stimulations, we tested if prolonged exposure to an immersive virtual environment (IVE) with increased curvature gain produces adaptation to that gain and modifies thresholds such that, over time, larger curvature gains can be applied for RDW. Therefore, participants first completed a measurement of their perceptual threshold for curvature gain. In a second session, the same participants were exposed to an IVE with a constant curvature gain in which they walked between two targets for about 20 minutes. Afterwards, their perceptual thresholds were measured again. The results show that the psychometric curves shifted after the exposure session and perceptual thresholds for increased curvature gain further increased. The increase of the detection threshold suggests that participants adapt to the manipulation and stronger curvature gains can be applied in RDW, and therefore improves its applicability in such situations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "111892", "output": "\"Rethinking Modularization: A Semantically-Deep Approach to Language Processing in Cognitive Agents\"\n\nor\n\n\"Beyond the Pipeline: Enhancing Efficiency in Language Understanding through OntoAgent's Cognitive Framework\"\n\nor\n\n\"Breaking Down Boundaries: A Cognitive Agent's Journey towards Semantically-Deep Language Processing\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

But language understanding, while a type of perception, involves many types of reasoning, and can even involve action, such as asking a clarification question about the intended meaning of an utterance. In the field of natural language processing, for its part, the common progression of processing modules is Syntax-Semantics-Pragmatics. But this modularization lacks cognitive plausibility and misses opportunities to enhance efficiency through the timely application of knowledge from multiple sources. This paper provides a high-level description of semantically-deep, reasoningrich language processing in the OntoAgent cognitive agent environment, which illustrates the practical gains of moving away from a strict adherence to traditional modularization and pipeline architectures.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.13}, {"id": "111893", "output": "Optimization of Joint TR Precoding and POPS Waveform Design for MISO-OFDM Systems: A Comparative Analysis of TR-MISO, TR-SISO, and PHYDYAS Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The mean-variance function is one of the most widely used objective functions in risk management due to its simplicity and interpretability. Existing algorithms for mean-variance optimization are based on multi-time-scale stochastic approximation, whose learning rate schedules are often hard to tune, and have only asymptotic convergence proof. In this paper, we develop a model-free policy search framework for mean-variance optimization with finite-sample error bound analysis (to local optima). Our starting point is a reformulation of the original mean-variance function with its Legendre-Fenchel dual, from which we propose a stochastic block coordinate ascent policy search algorithm. Both the asymptotic convergence guarantee of the last iteration's solution and the convergence rate of the randomly picked solution are provided, and their applicability is demonstrated on several benchmark domains.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111895", "output": "Edge Computing Secure Processing for Deep Learning Accelerators: A PUFs-and-PIM Based Protection Method (P3M)", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this scenario, the network model is exposed to the risk of being attacked in the unverified devices if the parameters and hyper-parameters are transmitted and processed in an unencrypted way. Our work tackles this security problem by using on-chip memory Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and Processing-In-Memory (PIM). We allow the model execution only on authorized devices and protect the model from white-box attacks, black-box attacks and model tampering attacks. The proposed PUFs-and-PIM based Protection method for neural Models (P3M), can utilize unstable PUFs to protect the neural models in edge deep learning accelerators with negligible performance overhead. The experimental results show considerable performance improvement over two state-of-the-art solutions we evaluated.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111896", "output": "Real-Time Traffic Optimization with Histogram-Based Route Guidance for Intelligent Transport Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Building a route forecasting system is a complex task, mainly because of the changing traffic conditions. This paper presents a new route guidance algorithm and presents a compact road traffic model with real time updating. The algorithm enables to select a shortest path between source to destination by estimating the histogram model which captures the higher order distribution function using ITS. The data entity collection through sensors used for histogram modelling is presented in detail. A microscopic simulation model is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic model against the existing algorithm. Average travel time and overall network productivity are measured using the simulation. Various scenarios were created to study the impact of the proposed model in the traffic modelling.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.3}, {"id": "111897", "output": "\"Ensemble-Based Genetic Algorithm for Simultaneous Region Concept Annotation and Feature Selection in Image Classification\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, a solution for a particular seed size k is often not enough to make an informed choice regarding budget and cost-effectiveness. In this article, we propose the computation of Influence Spectrum (InfSpec), the maximum influence at each possible seed set size k within a given range [klower,kupper], thus providing optimal decision making for any availability of budget or influence requirements. As none of the existing methods for InfMax are efficient enough for the task in large networks, we propose LISA (sub-Linear Influence Spectrum Approximation), an efficient approximation algorithm for InfSpec (and also InfMax) with the best-known worst-case guarantees for billion-scale networks. LISA returns an (1-1/e -&epsi;)-approximate influence spectrum with high probability (1-\u03b4), where &epsi;, \u03b4 are precision parameters provided by users. Using statistical decision theory, LISA has an asymptotic optimal running time (in addition to optimal approximation guarantee). In practice, LISA surpasses the state-of-the-art InfMax methods, taking less than 15 minutes to process a network of 41.7 million nodes and 1.5 billions edges.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "111899", "output": "\"EEG Signal Analysis of Alcohol Consumption and Monotonous Tasks: A Comparative Study of PCA, LDA, and Neural Networks\"\n\nor\n\n\"EEG Signal Analysis of Alcohol Consumption and Monotonous Tasks: Exploring the Effects of Alcohol on Brain Activity Using PCA, LDA, and Neural Networks\"\n\nor\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The EEG is captured while performing a monotonous task that can adversely affect the brain and possibly cause stress. Moreover, we investigate the effects of alcohol on the brain by capturing the data continuously after consumption of equal amounts of alcohol. We hope that our work will shed more light on the relationship between such actions and EEG, and investigate if there is any relation between the tasks and mental stress. EEG signals offers a rare look at brain activity, while, monotonous activities are well known to cause irritation which may contribute to mental stress. We apply PCA and LDA to characterize the change in each component, extract it and discriminate using a NN. After experiments, it was found that PCA and LDA are effective analysis methods in EEG signal analysis.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111900", "output": "Based on the provided features, I can generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\nDynamic Schema Integration, Schema Evolution, End-User Schema Creation\nDomain-Driven Development, Global Schema Fragments, Local Type Operators\nContent Management Systems, Schema Heterogeneity, User-Driven Development\n</similarpairs>\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Building functionality to create and modify data must keep pace with this heterogeneity, but the cost of constant development is high. In this paper, we present a novel approach that extends our previous integration system that uses domain structures-global schema fragments-and local type and integration operators by introducing new local record operators and global insert and update operators. We present two widgets that use the new operators: (i) a generic clone widget that allows users to selectively clone records shown in a global widget while creating new local records; (ii) a generic clone exploration widget that allows users to browse the CloneOf relationships and reason about how different cloned records and structures have evolved. We demonstrate our system with a running example of the clone and exploration widgets in a robotics educational repository.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111901", "output": "\"Parametric Greatest Common Divisor Computation via Minimal Comprehensive Gr obner Basis of Quotient Ideal\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

[...][...] is presented. The algorithm is based on a well-known simple insight that the GCD of two multivariate polynomials (non-parametric as well as parametric) can be extracted using the generator of the quotient ideal of a polynomial with respect to the second polynomial. And, further, this generator can be obtained by computing a minimal Gr obner basis of the quotient ideal. The main attraction of this idea is that it generalizes to the parametric case for which a comprehensive Gr obner basis is constructed for the parametric quotient ideal. It is proved that in a minimal comprehensive Gr obner system of a parametric quotient ideal, each branch of specializations corresponds to a principal parametric ideal with a single generator. Using this generator, the parametric GCD of that branch is obtained by division. This algorithm does not need to consider whether parametric polynomials are primitive w. r. t. the main variable. This is in sharp contrast to two algorithms recently proposed by Nagasaka (ISSAC, 2017). The resulting algorithm is not only conceptually simple to understand but is considerably efficient. The proposed algorithm and both of Nagasaka's algorithms have been implemented in Singular (available at http://www. mmrc. iss. ac. cn/dwang/software. html), and their performance is compared on a number of examples. For more than two polynomials, this process can be repeated by considering pairs of polynomials; the efficiency in that case becomes even more evident.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111902", "output": "\"Vertical Slit Field Effect Transistors for Low-Power ASIC Design: A Comparative Study of CMOS and VeSFET Architectures\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Experimental computer science is far from immune, although it should be easier for CS than other sciences, given the emphasis on experimental artifacts, such as source code, data sets, workflows, parameters, etc. The data management community pioneered methods at ACM SIGMOD 2007 and 2008 to encourage and incentivize authors to improve their software development and experimental practices. Now, after 10 years, the broader CS community has started to adopt Artifact Evaluation (AE) to review artifacts along with papers. In this paper, we examine how AE has incentivized authors, and whether the process is having a measurable impact. Our answer can help guide CS, and more broadly, other computationally-oriented sciences, in encouraging peer-review of software artifacts and developing additional community practices for incentives.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "111904", "output": "Based on the provided abstract and features, I would suggest the following title:\n\n\"System-theoretic analysis of multiaccess wireless networks: Characterizing service availability and performance bounds for bursty traffic\"\n\nor\n\n\"Multiaccess wireless networks: A system-theoretic framework for probabilistic performance bounds and fundamental tradeoffs\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Solutions for multiaccess communications have been approached with very different perspectives of the same problem, among them information-theoretic approaches at the physical layer, random access at the media access layer, and packet scheduling at the link or network layer. Different system models with sometimes incongruent assumptions make it difficult to compare or reconcile multiaccess solutions emerging from different areas. In this paper we address these difficulties by presenting system-theoretic characterizations of the available service in multiaccess networks for all three approaches. Using these characterizations we derive performance bounds of multiaccess systems that see bursty traffic. We take advantage of a recently proposed (min, \u00d7) network calculus, which enables the analysis of networks with time-variable traffic (in bits per second) in terms of the fading channels parameters, i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (in dB). For each of the multiaccess approaches considered, we are able to compute probabilistic performance bounds for multi-hop wireless channels. The numerical results shed light on fundamental tradeoffs offered by each of these approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111905", "output": "\"Fine-Grained Sentiment Classification and Controllable Text Generation: Joint Dual Learning for Inverse Task Prediction\"\n\nor\n\n\"Decoupling Sentiment Analysis and Text Generation: A Mutual Disentanglement Framework for Fine-Grained Aspect-Oriented Opinion and Content Representation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Joint Learning for In", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Most of the existing work solves the FGSC and the FGSG tasks in isolation, while ignoring the complementary benefits in between. This paper combines FGSC and FGSG as a joint dual learning system, encouraging them to learn the advantages from each other. Based on the dual learning framework, we further propose decoupling the feature representations in two tasks into fine-grained aspect-oriented opinion variables and content variables respectively, by performing mutual disentanglement learning upon them. We also propose to transform the difficult \"data-to-text'' generation fashion widely used in FGSG into an easier text-to-text generation fashion by creating surrogate natural language text as the model inputs. Experimental results on 7 sentiment analysis benchmarks including both the document-level and sentence-level datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the current strong-performing baselines on both the FGSC and FGSG tasks. Automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our FGSG model successfully generates fluent, diverse and rich content conditioned on fine-grained sentiments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111906", "output": "Hash-Based Traffic Steering on Softswitches: Mitigating Control and Data Plane Overhead through Flow-Hashing and Dynamic Weight Adjustment", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our method uses a flow-hashing technique applied to softswitches to carry out server and network load balancing without triggering the controller. By exploiting the advantages of HATS, we then derive two algorithms, HATS with Flowcell-based Multipathing (HATS-Flowcell) and Dynamic Weight Adjustment for HATS (D-HATS), to address hash collision problems which downgrade system performance. The first algorithm divides an elephant flow into various equal-size flowcells, which are distributed over network paths as individual flows. The second algorithm periodically updates the hashing weights of VNFs and network paths according to their current load status. Our implementation demonstrates that HATS can be readily deployed on commodity network hardware. Furthermore, our experimental results show that D-HATS has roughly the same load balancing performance with Least Load First (LLF), a controller-based service chaining algorithm; while significantly reducing the number of flow entries and service chaining time by 54% and 93%.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111907", "output": "Analyzing Topological Structure in Urban Space Representations Using Graph Spectral Methods and GIS Databases", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Moreover, such devices are often always-on or running on batteries. Therefore, it is worth investigating their energy consumption to provide software developers and users with indicators for understanding how much energy the device is consuming while running a software application. In this paper, we explain a procedure for the creation of an energy consumption model of SBCs based on the usage of its components. We apply the procedure on a Raspberry PI 2 model B to test the model with a set of real applications. The results demonstrate the practical feasibility of the approach and show that estimated consumption values on our device have an average error of 2.2%, which is a good approximation without using external and expensive measuring devices.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.84}, {"id": "111909", "output": "> F5-HD: A Fast and Flexible FPGA-Based Framework for Accelerating Hyperdimensional Computing\n> Hyperdimensional (HD) Computing on FPGAs: A Comparative Study of Energy Efficiency and Training Speed", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The underlying computation of HD involves a substantial number of element-wise operations (e.g., addition and multiplications) on ultra-wise hypervectors, in the granularities of as small as a single bit, which can be effectively parallelized and pipelined. In addition, though different HD applications might vary in terms of number of input features and output classes (labels), they generally follow the same computation flow. Such characteristics of HD computing inimitably matches with the intrinsic capabilities of FPGAs, making these devices a unique solution for accelerating these applications. In this paper, we propose F5-HD, a fast and flexible FPGA-based framework for refreshing the performance of HD computing. F5-HD eliminates the arduous task of handcrafted designing of hardware accelerators by automatically generating an FPGA implementation of HD accelerator leveraging a template of optimized processing elements, according to the applications specification and user's constraint. Our evaluations using different classification benchmarks revealed that F5-HD provides 6.9x and 7.8\u00d7 (11.9\u00d7 and 1.7\u00d7) higher energy efficiency improvement and faster training (inference) as compared to an optimized implementation of HD on AMD R9 390 GPU, respectively.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.82}, {"id": "111910", "output": "Adversarial Generative Networks for Flexible Objectives in Real-World Applications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Hand-designed destination maps include only the most important roads in the region and are non-uniformly scaled to ensure that all of the important roads from the highways to the residential streets are visible. We present the first automated system for creating such destination maps based on the design principles used by mapmakers. Our system includes novel algorithms for selecting the important roads based on mental representations of road networks, and for laying out the roads based on a non-linear optimization procedure. The final layouts are labeled and rendered in a variety of styles ranging from informal to more formal map styles. The system has been used to generate over 57,000 destination maps by thousands of users. We report feedback from both a formal and informal user study, as well as provide quantitative measures of success.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111912", "output": "\"Revealing System Failures: Hybrid Methods for Characterizing and Explaining Machine Learning System Malfunctions\"\n\nor\n\n\"Unveiling the Black Box: Pandora - A Hybrid Framework for Describing and Explaining System Failures in Multi-Component Machine Learning Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"Transparency in Machine Learning: Hybrid", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Accountability requires deep understanding of system behavior and its failures. Current evaluation methods such as single-score error metrics and confusion matrices provide aggregate views of system performance that hide important shortcomings. Understanding details about failures is important for identifying pathways for refinement, communicating the reliability of systems in different settings, and for specifying appropriate human oversight and engagement. Characterization of failures and shortcomings is particularly complex for systems composed of multiple machine learned components. For such systems, existing evaluation methods have limited expressiveness in describing and explaining the relationship among input content, the internal states of system components, and final output quality. We present Pandora, a set of hybrid human-machine methods and tools for describing and explaining system failures. Pandora leverages both human and system-generated observations to summarize conditions of system malfunction with respect to the input content and system architecture. We share results of a case study with a machine learning pipeline for image captioning that show how detailed performance views can be beneficial for analysis and debugging.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111913", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Emojis in Social Media\", \"Language of Emotions\", \"Multimodal Sentiment Analysis\", \"Predicting Emoji Usage\", \"Emotion Expression in Digital Communication\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\nWord frequency:", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

They can express more delicate feelings beyond textual information and improve the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication. Recent advances in machine learning make it possible to automatic compose text messages with emojis. However, the usages of emojis can be complicated and subtle so that analyzing and predicting emojis is a challenging problem. In this paper, we first construct a benchmark dataset of emojis with tweets and systematically investigate emoji usages in terms of tweet content, tweet structure and user demographics. Inspired by the investigation results, we further propose a multitask multimodality gated recurrent unit (mmGRU) model to predict the categories and positions of emojis. The model leverages not only multimodality information such as text, image and user demographics, but also the strong correlations between emoji categories and their positions. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy for predicting emojis for tweets (+9.0% in F1-value for category and +4.6% in F1-value for position). Based on the experimental results, we further conduct a series of case studies to unveil how emojis are used in social media.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111914", "output": "\"Enabling Accessibility: An Open-Source Platform for Developing Rule-Based Speech-to-Sign Language Translation Applications\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Speech recognition is performed using the Nuance Recognizer 10.2 toolkit, and signed output, including both manual and non-manual components, is rendered using the JASigning avatar system. The platform is designed to make the component technologies readily accessible to sign language experts who are not necessarily computer scientists. Translation grammars are written in a version of Synchronous Context-Free Grammar adapted to the peculiarities of sign language. All processing is carried out on a remote server, with content uploaded and accessed through a web interface. Initial experiences show that simple translation grammars can be implemented on a time-scale of a few hours to a few days and produce signed output readily comprehensible to Deaf informants. Overall, the platform drastically lowers the barrier to entry for researchers interested in building applications that generate high-quality signed language.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "111915", "output": "Measuring the Learnability of Interactive Systems Through User Log Analysis and System Interaction Models", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we propose an approach to measure the learnability of interactive systems during their daily use. We rely on recording in a user log the user actions that take place during a run of the system and on replaying them over the system interaction models, which describe the expected ways of executing system tasks. Our approach identifies deviations between the interaction models and the user log and assesses their weight through a fitness value. By measuring the rate of the fitness value for subsequent executions of the system we are able not only to understand if the system is learnable with respect to its tasks, but also to quantify its degree of learnability over time and to identify potential learning issues.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "111916", "output": "\"Economic Model Predictive Control: Identifying Optimal Inputs for Dynamic Process Economics\"\n\nor\n\n\"Model Predictive Control of Economic Processes: A Novel Approach to Input Selection and Optimization\"\n\nor\n\n\"Dynamic Economic Optimization in Model Predictive Control: Input Selection and Control Configuration Design\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The objective function used in the EMPC may be a general nonlinear function that describes the process/system economics. Since this function is not derived on the basis of classical control considerations only (e.g., stabilization, tracking, and optimal control action calculation), selecting the appropriate control configuration and quantifying the influence of a given input on an economic cost is an important task for the proper design of an EMPC scheme. Owing to these considerations, we propose to utilize the relative degree of the economic cost function with respect to an input to identify and select inputs with the most influence on the economic cost function to be assigned to EMPC. Other considerations for input selection for EMPC are also discussed and the presented control configuration selection for EMPC method is demonstrated using a chemical process example.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.03}, {"id": "111917", "output": "\"Convergence of Complex Event Processing and Business Process Management: Mapping Opportunities and Challenges Across Four Quadrants\"\n\nor \n\n\"Exploring the Intersection of CEP and BPM: A Four-Quadrant Framework for Identifying Core Issues and Future Directions\"\n\nor \n\n\"Beyond Specific Solutions: A Comprehensive Mapping of CEP and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While specific combinations of BPM and CEP have attracted research attention, resulting in solutions to specific problems, we attempt to take a broad view at the opportunities and challenges involved. We first illustrate these by a detailed example from the logistics domain. We then propose a mapping of this area into four quadrants \u2014\u00a0- two quadrants drawing from CEP to create or extend process models and two quadrants starting from a process model to address how it can guide CEP. Existing literature is reviewed and specific challenges and opportunities are indicated for each of these quadrants. Based on this mapping, we identify challenges and opportunities that recur across quadrants and can be considered as the core issues of this combination. We suggest that addressing these issues in a generic manner would form a sound basis for future applications and advance this area significantly.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111918", "output": "\"Scaling Memristor Crossbar-Based Logic Circuits for Next-Generation Electronics\"\n\nAlternatively, based on similar abstract-title pairs:\n\n\"Beyond CMOS: Exploring Memristor Crossbar Architectures for Scalable Electronics\"\n\nAlternatively, based on similar abstract-title pairs:\n\n\"Memristor Crossbar Logic: A Scal", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

With the goal of maximizing his T-period payoff, the bidder determines the optimal allocation of his budget among his bids for K goods at each period. As a bidding strategy, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm, inspired by the dynamic programming approach to the knapsack problem. The proposed algorithm, referred to as dynamic programming on discrete set (DPDS), achieves a regret order of O(root T log T). By showing that the regret is lower bounded by Omega(root T) for any strategy, we conclude that DPDS is order optimal up to a root log T term. We evaluate the performance of DPDS empirically in the context of virtual trading in wholesale electricity markets by using historical data from the New York market. Empirical results show that DPDS consistently outperforms benchmark heuristic methods that are derived from machine learning and online learning approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111920", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\nGiven the similar abstract-title pairs:\n- \"Graphene-Based Switching Devices: A Novel Approach for Enhanced Performance\"\n- \"Reconfigurable Gate Technology for Next-Generation Electronics\"\n\nUsing the features:\n- The abstract mentions the exceptional electro-mech", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This RG could become a popular choice among the many emerging technology devices thanks to its flexibility and efficiency; however, its widespread adoption requires significant research on the automation of the design process, including modeling, optimization, and synthesis. In this work, we focus on synthesis, and specifically on the implementation style of designs that use RGs. We compare three different styles, namely a traditional standard cell flow, one using a direct mapping from BDD representations, and a third one based on a Look Up Table (LUT)-based implementation. We analyze the performance, area and power consumption of benchmarks synthesized using the three different styles, and compare to a bulk CMOS implementation. The results show that RG-based circuits are superior w.r.t. CMOS, and that the choice of the implementation style strongly affects the quality of the results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111921", "output": "Based on the provided features, I can generate a title that reflects my writing style.

In this work, we show that the hypothesis of Dinur et. al. follows from a conjecture we call the Inverse Shortcode Hypothesis characterizing the non-expanding sets of the degree-two shortcode graph. We also show the latter conjecture is equivalent to a characterization of the non-expanding sets in the Grassman graph, as hypothesized by a follow-up paper of Dinur et. al. (2017). Following our work, Khot, Minzer and Safra (2018) proved the Inverse Shortcode Hypothesis. Combining their proof with our result and the reduction of Dinur et. al. (2016), completes the proof of the 2 to 2 conjecture with imperfect completeness. Moreover, we believe that the shortcode graph provides a useful view of both the hypothesis and the reduction, and might be useful in extending it further.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111922", "output": "Transfer Learning for Gaussian Process-based Particle Filter Tracking with Tracking-by-Fusion: A Novel Framework for Object Tracking", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been little research on the problem of energy consumption for orchestrating online SFC requests in multi-domain networks. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of an energy-efficient online SFC request that is orchestrated across multiple clouds as an integer linear programming (ILP) model to find an optimal solution. Then, we analyze the complexity of this ILP model and prove that the problem is NP-hard. Additionally, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm named energy-efficient online SFC request orchestration across multiple domains (EE-SFCO-MD) for near-optimally solving the mentioned problem. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Simulation results show that EE-SFCO-MD consumes less energy than existing approaches while the online SFC\u2019s requirements are met and the privacy of each cloud is effectively guaranteed. The low computational complexity of the heuristic approach makes it applicable for quickly responding to online SFC requests.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111925", "output": "Efficient Structure-Preserving Solution of Large-Scale Affine Variational Inequalities via PathAVI: A Pivotal Approach for High-Accuracy and Scalability", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper describes PathAVI, a structure-preserving pivotal approach, that can efficiently process (solve or determine infeasible) large-scale sparse instances of the problem with theoretical guarantees and at high accuracy. PathAVI implements a strategy known to process models with good theoretical properties without reducing the problem to specialized forms, since such reductions may destroy sparsity in the models and can lead to very long computational times. We demonstrate formally that PathAVI implicitly follows the theoretically sound iteration paths, and can be implemented in a large scale setting using existing sparse linear algebra and linear programming techniques without employing a reduction. We also extend the class of problems that PathAVI can process. The paper illustrates the effectiveness of our approach by comparison to the Path solver used on a complementarity reformulation of the AVI in the context of applications in friction contact and Nash Equilibria. PathAVI is a general purpose solver, and freely available under the same conditions as Path.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.7}, {"id": "111926", "output": "\"Optimization and Analysis of Push-Pull Cable-Based Actuation Systems in Wearable Robotic Devices for Gait Rehabilitation\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Cable-Based Actuation Systems for Rehabilitation Robotics: A Review of Cable-Conduit Configurations\"\n\"Cable Dynamics in Rehabilitation Robotics: A Study on Actuation Systems for Wearable", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In such applications, the cable dynamics represents the prescribing component for the system operating loads and control. A good understanding of the actuation, based on cable-conduit transmission, is therefore becoming mandatory. There are several types of cable-conduit configurations used for the actuation. Currently, there is lack of information in literature with regard to the push-pull cable type.

Traditional univariate techniques are fast and straightforward to interpret, but are unable to unveil relationships among multiple features. The aim of this work is to evaluate the applicability of clustering based techniques to the problem of feature extraction in resting state fMRI data analysis. More specifically, we devise a methodology based on consensus clustering, a particular approach to the clustering problem that consists in combining different partitions of the same data set in a final solution. Our approach was validated on a real-word data set, deriving from multiple clinical studies on Parkinson\u2019s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our results show that the adoption of consensus-based techniques can indeed lead to an improvement of the results, not only in terms of feature discriminability, but also from the point of view of interpretability.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111928", "output": "\"Efficient Background Modeling with Robustness and Parallelization: A Quantitative Evaluation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This work is inspired from the theory of Michailovich and Tannenbaum (2006) where it was shown that the log transformation of clinical images converts the speckle noise to white Gaussian noise (WGN) with outliers. In this context, we propose to apply a non-linear transformation (using functions with horizontal asymptotes) to speckle noise which would map the outlier to the asymptote of the function. This would result in suppression of the outliers and thereby reducing the problem to cancellation of WGN. We adhere to fuzzy set theory for defining such transformations as they can be well characterized with vague linguistic terms. In this work, a property scene is generated using a membership function which has the ability to suppress the outliers. Thereafter, the property scene is updated such that the membership of belonging of the spels in a neighborhood is in agreement with each other to the defined property. This, in turn, will restore the homogeneity in the neighborhood of the image when the property scene is de-fuzzified back to image space. To measure the compliance of a neighborhood spel, a concept of degree of conformity is introduced. This degree of conformity determines the contribution of the neighboring spel in the update process of the property scene. To elicit the effectiveness of the proposed technique, comparative analysis has been done with five state-of-the-art techniques on in silico images using five standard measures and in vivo ultrasound images with two performance indices. Moreover, to show the impact of the de-noising algorithm on performance, segmentation based investigation is carried out on 102 ultrasound images of carotid artery. A robustness analysis with increasing level of noise is also investigated. The performance of segmentation is reported in a box plot of precision and recall. Qualitative and quantitative analysis reveal the promising performance of the proposed technique.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "111931", "output": "\"Optimizing Student Engagement with Web-Based Interactive Learning Material: A Large-Scale Study of Reading and Homework Completion Rates\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Furthermore, getting students to do homework, consisting of small practice problems and questions, is also a long-standing difficulty without massive grading resources. And even then, preventing students from copying others' solutions is difficult as well. Today, the web enables new interactive learning material that is replacing past forms of textbooks and homework assignments, and students today commonly have access to needed devices and the internet. This paper provides data on student reading and homework completion rates for web-based interactive learning material we created that automatically records reading and homework activity by students. The data is for several thousand students at over 10 universities, for introductory programming classes in Java, Python, and C++. The data shows that, with an appropriate amount of awarded points, required-reading completion rate was 84%, and auto-graded homework completion rate was 75%, varying somewhat based on how many course grade points those items were worth. Students on average spent about 10 minutes reading each section, and about 3 minutes per homework problem, both appropriate amounts for those items. Furthermore, we developed measures of whether students were earnestly attempting the reading and homeworks, versus just \\\"cheating the system\\\" to get course grade points. We describe those earnestness measures in this paper. With proper design and amount of assigned work, 80%-90% of students earnestly did the reading and homework activities, even when no penalty existed for cheating the system, and fewer than 3% blatantly cheated the system to get their points.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "111932", "output": "Temporal Evolution of Spatio-Temporal Modelling in Geographic Information Science: A Historical Survey of Trends and Future Directions", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We mathematically prove the achievability based on the derivation of a secure user-scaling law. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a better average secrecy rate than the conventional scheme in a finite N case, even if both schemes obtain the same secure user-scaling law as N  .\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111934", "output": "Temporal Motif Counting via Efficient Sampling Frameworks: A Novel Approach for Fast and Approximate Estimation of Temporal Motifs in Large Graphs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, modern graph datasets now contain richer structure, and incorporating temporal information in particular has become a key part of network analysis. Consequently, temporal motifs, which are generalizations of small subgraph patterns that incorporate temporal ordering on edges, are an emerging part of the network analysis toolbox. However, there are no algorithms for fast estimation of temporal motifs counts; moreover, we show that even counting simple temporal star motifs is NP-complete. Thus, there is a need for fast and approximate algorithms. Here, we present the first frequency estimation algorithms for counting temporal motifs. More specifically, we develop a sampling framework that sits as a layer on top of existing exact counting algorithms and enables fast and accurate memory-efficient estimates of temporal motif counts. Our results show that we can achieve one to two orders of magnitude speedups over existing algorithms with minimal and controllable loss in accuracy on a number of datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "111935", "output": "\"Rethinking the Benefits of Mobile/Multi-access Edge Computing: Unveiling New Advantages Beyond Low-Latency Offloading\"\n\nor alternatively:\n\"Debunking the Myths of Mobile/Multi-access Edge Computing: Exploring Emerging Benefits from Data Scalability, Application Scalability, Intent-driven Networking,", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

On the other hand, the performance of UE is rapidly improving with abundant resources for enabling local data processing. In this paper, we rethink the benefits of MEC by first arguing these benefits are myths, that is, the advancement of UE may defeat the often-assumed benefits of MEC, i.e., offloading computation and reducing latency, and then demystify the myths by carefully summarizing the latency and computational requirements of the existing applications possibly benefiting from MEC by surveying several tens of publications while examining the recent UEs performance improvement. We also attempt to undercover new benefits of MEC. In the light of these observations, we conclude that MEC is not necessarily just required for low-latency and computationally intensive applications, but also brings benefits from the four additional perspectives: (1) Data Scalability, (2) Application Scalability, (3) Intent-driven Networking, (4) Partial offloading of the network functions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111936", "output": "\"Parallelizing Finite-State Machines through Efficient Transition Enumeration\"\n\nor alternatively\n\n\"Breaking Dependences in Finite-State Machine Computations via Parallel Transition Enumeration\"\n\nor also\n\n\"Efficient Parallelization of Finite-State Machines using Transition Enumeration\"\n\nor \n\n\"Parallelizing FSMs through Efficient Enumeration of Transitions\"\n\nor \n\n\"Transition Enumeration", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

FSM computations typically involve data-dependent iterations with unpredictable memory-access patterns making them difficult to parallelize. This paper describes a parallel algorithm for FSMs that breaks dependences across iterations by efficiently enumerating transitions from all possible states on each input symbol. This allows the algorithm to utilize various sources of data parallelism available on modern hardware, including vector instructions and multiple processors/cores. For instance, on benchmarks from three FSM applications: regular expressions, Huffman decoding, and HTML tokenization, the parallel algorithm achieves up to a 3x speedup over optimized sequential baselines on a single core, and linear speedups up to 21x on 8 cores.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111937", "output": "Heterogeneous Access Metamodel for Efficient Remote Sensing Observation Management (HAMERM) in Precision Agriculture: A Five-Tuple Metadata Structure and Sensor Web Techniques.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Because of the heterogeneous characteristics and the petabyte data size of RSO, massive remote sensing processing in RSO management has been hampered. Here, we present a heterogeneous access metamodel for efficient RSO management (HAMERM) and verify it in PA. The structure of basic metadata components is defined. A five-tuple metadata structure based on the metaobject facility is designed. HAMERM consists of identification, platform, observation, product, and access, which represent the five aspects of RSO metadata information. In addition, the flatMap/reduceByKey algorithms and the table structure have been proposed under Sensor Web and Geographic Information Science (GIS) techniques. Intensive experiments in Guangdong Province, China are conducted to test the proposed method. Two RSO metadata formulization instances were conducted to examine the ability of sheltering the differences of multisource and heterogeneous RSO. Experiments containing data storage and data soil moisture (SM) mapping were performed. The results suggest that the HAMERM method achieved a performance 30.1 times higher than that of Hadoop and three times higher than that of Spark (stand-alone). Consequently, the proposed HAMERM can be applied to achieve efficient SM mapping within PA, which is helpful for efficient RSO management for the IoT.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.64}, {"id": "111938", "output": "\"Secure Outsourcing of k-NN Queries via KD-Trees and Garbled Circuits\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This convenient service has brought a shift from the traditional client\u2013server model to DataBase as a Service (DBaaS). Although DBaaS relieves the clients from the data management burdens, a significant concern about the data privacy remains. In this work, we focus on outsourcing secure k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) query, and provide the first sublinear solution (with preprocessing) with computational complexity O(klgn(lg2n+lg3k)). Our construction uses the data structure called kd-tree to achieve the sublinear query complexity. In order to protect data access patterns, garbled circuits are used to simulate Oblivious RAM (ORAM) for accessing data in the kd-tree. Compared with the existing solutions, our scheme imposes only constant overhead on both the data owner and the querying client.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "111939", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generated a title that is similar to my past works:\n\n\"Adaptive CCA for Efficient SSVEP-Based BCI: A Subject- and Device-Specific Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"SPACCA: A Spectrum and Phase Adaptive CCA for High-Performance SSVEP-Based B", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this study, we propose a Spectrum and Phase Adaptive CCA (SPACCA) for subject-and device-specific SSVEP-based BCI. Cross subject heterogeneity of spectrum distribution is taken into consideration to improve the prediction accuracy. We design a library of phase shifting reference signals to accommodate subjective and device-related response time lag. With the flexible reference signal generating approach, the system can be optimized for any specific flickering source, include LED, computer screen and mobile devices. We evaluated the performance of SPACCA using three sets of data that use LED, computer screen and mobile device (tablet) as stimuli sources respectively. The first two data sets are publicly available whereas the third data set is collected in our BCI lab. Across different data sets, SPACCA consistently performs better than the baseline, i.e. standard CCA approach. Statistical test to compare the overall results across three data sets yield a p-value of 1.66e-6, implying the improvement is significant.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111940", "output": "Diverse Shortest Path Generation for Multimodal Images via Modified Viterbi Algorithm", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our approach is not linked to a specific biological problem and can be applied to a large variety of images thanks to its generic implementation as a user-friendly ImageJ/Fiji plugin. It relies on the introduction of additional layers in a Viterbi path graph, which requires slight modifications to the standard Viterbi algorithm rules. This layered graph construction allows for the specification of various constraints imposing diversity between solutions. Results: The software allows obtaining a collection of diverse shortest paths under some user-defined constraints through a convenient and user-friendly interface. It can be used alone or be integrated into larger image analysis pipelines.

Many companies face challenges in obtaining the benefits associated with effective strategic sourcing decision-making. Enterprise modeling can contribute to strategic sourcing decision-making by helping in the conceptualization, design and exploration of multiple strategic options for better decision-making. In this article, the authors explore a solution approach that refines the existing Enterprise Engineering EE modeling discipline into a Service-oriented Enterprise Engineering SoEE modeling discipline, by founding it on the novel application of the Viable Systems Approach vSa towards strategic sourcing decision-making. The proposed modeling discipline provides 1 the systemic viewpoints to interpret complex sourcing phenomena; and 2 the outside-box models to specify the value-driven interactions of an enterprise as a system with other actors. Finally, to operationalize the modeling discipline the authors introduce the conceptual basis C.A.R.S of a modeling language to apply the SoEE viewpoints and develop the related models for supporting strategic sourcing decision-making. The paper elaborates on preliminary ideas presented at the SoEA4EE 2013 workshop.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111943", "output": "\"Bayesian Modeling of Inter-Sentential Emotion and Topic Dynamics for Enhanced Social Emotion Detection\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Considering emotions as latent variables, various probabilistic graphical models have been proposed for emotion detection. However, the bag-of-words assumption prohibits those models from capturing the inter-relations between sentences in a document. Moreover, existing models can only detect emotions at either the document-level or the sentence-level. In this paper, we propose an effective Bayesian model, called hidden Topic\u2013Emotion Transition model, by assuming that words in the same sentence share the same emotion and topic and modeling the emotions and topics in successive sentences as a Markov chain. By doing so, not only the document-level emotion but also the sentence-level emotion can be detected simultaneously. Experimental results on the two public corpora show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both document-level and sentence-level emotion detection.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111944", "output": "\"Global Analysis of Conventional Scaffolds in Analog Series Reveals Limitations in Scaffold Hopping Potential\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To evaluate scaffold hopping potential from a principal point of view, regardless of the computational methods that are applied, a global analysis of conventional scaffolds in analog series from compound activity classes was carried out. The majority of analog series was found to contain multiple scaffolds, thus enabling the detection of intra-series scaffold hops among closely related compounds. More than 1000 activity classes were found to contain increasing proportions of multi-scaffold analog series. Thus, using such activity classes for scaffold hopping analysis is likely to overestimate the scaffold hopping (core structure replacement) potential of computational methods, due to an abundance of artificial scaffold hops that are possible within analog series.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "111945", "output": "Team Formation and Partitioning in Cooperative Learning: A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming and Heuristic Approach\n\n<similarpairs>\nTeam Formation and Partitioning in Cooperative Learning: A Mixed-Integer Programming Approach\nTeam Formation and Partitioning in Cooperative Learning: A Heuristic Algorithm\n\n<features>\n- Use of \"heterogeneous", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Key factors for team performance are competences, personality and team members' genders. Here, we present a computational model to form heterogeneous teams that incorporates those key factors. In addition, we propose efficient algorithms to partition a classroom into teams of even size and homogeneous performance. The first algorithm is based on an ILP formulation. For small problem instances this approach is appropriate. However, this is not the case for large problems, for which we propose a heuristic algorithm. We study the computational properties of both algorithms in the context of student teams.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111946", "output": "Optimization Under Uncertainty with Soft Constraints: A Lagrangian Heuristic Approach to Enhancing Flexibility in Planning Strategies", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the formats of business process models are very different, which makes it a challenge to fuse them in a unified way without changing their original representations and semantics. To solve this problem, this paper uses semantic interoperability technique which is able to transform heterogeneous process models into uniform registered items. Based on the general and unambiguous metamodel for process model registration (PMR for short) in ISO/IEC 19763-5 that we proposed before, in this article, we provide a generic process model registration framework for registering heterogeneous business process models to facilitate semantic discovery of business processes across enterprises, and promote process interoperation and business collaboration. Considering that Event-driven Process Chain (EPC) is a popular process model widely used in the industry, we focus on the mapping rules and related specific transformation algorithms from EPC to PMR as an instantiation of our framework and develop an automatic process model registration tool for EPC. Moreover, we conduct a series of experiments to verify the correctness and efficiency of our proposed framework by leveraging the real data set of 604 EPCs from SAP.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111948", "output": "Based on the provided abstract and features, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Semantic Representation of Access Control Policies in Cloud Environments: Enabling Effective Policy Formulation and Scalable Reasoning\"\n\nUsing the provided similar abstract-title pairs:\n- \"Semantic Representation of Access Control Policies in Cloud Environments\"\n- \"A Semantic Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

One way to alleviate these concerns is to devise suitable policies that infuse adequate access controls into cloud services. However, the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments, coupled with the heterogeneous nature of cloud services, hinders the formulation of effective and interoperable access control policies that are suitable for the underlying domain of application. To this end, this work proposes an approach to the semantic representation of access control policies and, in particular, to the semantic representation of the context expressions incorporated in such policies. More specifically, the proposed approach enables stakeholders to accurately define the structure of their policies, in terms of relevant knowledge artefacts, and thus infuse into these policies their particular security and business requirements. This clearly leads to more effective policies, whilst it enables semantic reasoning about the abidance of policies by the prescribed structure. In order to alleviate the scalability concerns associated with semantic reasoning, the proposed approach introduces a reference implementation that extends XACML 3.0 with an expert system fused with reasoning capabilities through the incorporation of suitable meta-rules.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111949", "output": "Designing for an Ageing Population: A Critical Examination of Usability Evaluation Methodologies for Older Adults", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

At the same time, older adults are using the Internet and mobile technologies in increasingly large numbers. As evidenced by the proceedings of many conferences such as the ACM MobileHCI or the ACM CHI, the usability of interactive technologies designed for older adults is of significant concern. Yet, the methodologies we employ for designing and evaluating such interfaces are largely the same as those used for any other user group. In this position paper, we argue that one methodological size does not fit all especially when it comes to usability evaluations with older adults. We do so by reflecting on our own experiences with designing and evaluating interactive technologies for older adults (particularly for those over 80 years -- the \\\"oldest old\\\"). We then propose for discussion senior-centred approaches and adaptations of established usability evaluation methodologies.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111950", "output": "Comparison Framework for Runtime Monitoring Approaches: A Taxonomic Analysis and Evaluation of Existing Methods", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The full behavior of complex software systems often only emerges during operation. They thus need to be monitored at run time to check that they adhere to their requirements. Diverse runtime monitoring approaches have been developed in various domains and for different purposes. Their sheer number and heterogeneity, however, make it hard to find the right approach for a specific application or purpose. The aim of our research therefore was to develop a comparison framework for runtime monitoring approaches. Our framework is based on an analysis of the literature and existing taxonomies for monitoring languages and patterns. We use examples from existing monitoring approaches to explain the framework. We demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to 32 existing approaches and by comparing 3 selected approaches in the light of different monitoring scenarios. We also discuss perspectives for researchers.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "111951", "output": "\"Passivity-Based Stability Enhancement for Explicit Force Control in Direct Force Control of Robots\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper presents the results of novel approaches for passivity-based stability for a particular direct force control method, namely explicit force control. A step-by-step procedure to passivate and stabilise the control loop is presented and it explains how Time Domain Passivity Approach, a passivity-based tool widely used in teleoperation and haptics has been extended and applied in explicit force control. The electrical circuit and network-port representations derived in the process allows the analytical evaluation of the system and can be applied in other control architectures as well. The stability methods are presented both qualitatively and quantitatively with simulations and hardware experiments. A discussion about the results obtained and the energy behavior is also provided. Results are promising and suggest that these methods can be used for stable and high-bandwidth force control of robotic manipulators.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "111952", "output": "\"Efficient Discovery of Rare Closed Sequences via Pattern Structure Modeling and Sequence Alignment\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We also propose a discussion and characterization of the search space of closed sequences and, through the notion of sequence alignments, provide an intuitive implementation of a similarity operator for the sequence pattern structure based on directed acyclic graphs. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art closed sequence mining algorithms showing that our approach can largely outperform them when dealing with large regions of the search space.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "111953", "output": "\"Mitigating Prefetcher Interference in Prime and Probe Cache Side-channel Attacks\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This interference is not accounted for in previous attacks. In this paper, we propose PAPP, a Prefetcher-Aware Prime Probe attack that can operate even in the presence of aggressive prefetchers. Specifically, we reverse engineer the prefetcher and replacement policy on several CPUs and use these insights to design a prime and probe attack that minimizes the impact of the prefetcher. We evaluate PAPP using Cache Side-channel Vulnerability (CSV) metric and demonstrate the substantial improvements in the quality of the channel under different conditions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.37}, {"id": "111954", "output": "Learning-Driven Feature Generation for Virtual Screening: A Deep Learning Approach to Outperforming Traditional Methods", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We propose an approach where this conversion is learned by a convolutional neural network finding features that are useful for the task at hand based on the available data. Preliminary results indicate that our current approach can already come up with features that perform similarly well as common methods. Since this approach does not yet use any chemical properties, results could be improved in future versions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "111955", "output": "Temporal Prophecy: A Mechanism for Refining Infinite-State Systems via First-Order Linear Temporal Logic Formulas", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For infinite-state systems, these transformations are inherently imprecise. That is, for some instances, the temporal property holds, but the resulting safety property does not. This paper introduces a mechanism for tackling this imprecision. This mechanism, which we call temporal prophecy, is inspired by prophecy variables. Temporal prophecy refines an infinite-state system using first-order linear temporal logic formulas, via a suitable tableau construction. For a specific liveness-to-safety transformation based on first-order logic, we show that using temporal prophecy strictly increases the precision. Furthermore, temporal prophecy leads to robustness of the proof method, which is manifested by a cut elimination theorem. We integrate our approach into the Ivy deductive verification system, and show that it can handle challenging temporal verification examples.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111956", "output": "\"Designing General-Purpose Multi-Robot Platforms for Human-Robot Interaction: The BWIBot Approach\"\n\nor \n\n\"Building-Wide Intelligence: A Custom-Designed Multi-Robot Platform for Human-Robot Interaction and Service Robotics\"\n\nor \n\n\"Enabling Human-Robot Collaboration: The Development and Applications of the BW", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This article introduces a novel, custom-designed multi-robot platform for research on AI, robotics, and especially human-robot interaction for service robots. Called BWIBots, the robots were designed as a part of the Building-Wide Intelligence (BWI) project at the University of Texas at Austin. The article begins with a description of, and justification for, the hardware and software design decisions underlying the BWIBots, with the aim of informing the design of such platforms in the future. It then proceeds to present an overview of various research contributions that have enabled the BWIBots to better (a) execute action sequences to complete user requests, (b) efficiently ask questions to resolve user requests, (c) understand human commands given in natural language, and (d) understand human intention from afar. The article concludes with a look forward towards future research opportunities and applications enabled by the BWIBot platform.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111957", "output": "\"Simulating Register Machines with Extended Spiking Neural P Systems Featuring White Hole Rules: Beyond Turing's Limitations\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Simulating Register Machines with Extended Spiking Neural P Systems\", \"Beyond Turing's Limitations with White Hole Rules\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n  {\"word choice\": \"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Selective encryption methods can reduce the amount of computation needed while satisfying high-level security requirements. This is achieved by selecting an important part of the video data and encrypting it. In this paper, to ensure format compliance and security, we propose a special encryption method for H.264, which encrypts only the DC/ACs of I-macroblocks and the motion vectors of P-macroblocks. In particular, the proposed new selective encryption method exploits the error propagation property in an H.264 decoder and improves the collective performance by analyzing the tradeoff between the visual security level and the processing speed compared to typical selective encryption methods (i.e., I-frame, P-frame encryption, and combined I-/P-frame encryption). Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the encryption workload without any significant degradation of visual security.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "111959", "output": "\"Capturing Agency in Uncertain Environments: A Unified Framework for Probabilistic Argumentation and Reinforcement Learning\"\n\nor \n\n\"A Probabilistic and Logic-Based Approach to Agent Motivations and Norms in Uncertain Environments\"\n\nor \n\n\"Unified Reasoning for Uncertain Agents: A Framework for Probabil", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper attempts to address both dimensions within a single unified framework, by bringing together probabilistic argumentation and reinforcement learning. We show how a probabilistic rule-based argumentation framework can capture Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning agents; and how the framework allows us to characterise agents and their argument-based motivations from both a logic-based perspective and a probabilistic perspective. We advocate and illustrate the use of our approach to capture models of agency and norms, and argue that, in addition to providing a novel method for investigating agent types, the unified framework offers a sound basis for taking a mentalistic approach to agent profiles.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111960", "output": "\"Anticipatory Human-Robot Interface for Collaborative Assembly: Real-Time Motion Prediction and Dynamic Stopping Criteria\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Novel dynamic stopping criteria have been proposed to flexibly adjust the trade-off between early anticipation and accuracy. Results show that our system outperforms previous methods, achieving a real-time classification accuracy of 94.3\u00b12.9% after 160.0msec\u00b180.0msec from movement onset. The proposed interface can find many applications in the Industry 4.0 framework, where it is crucial for autonomous and collaborative robots to understand human movements as soon as possible to avoid accidents and injuries.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "111961", "output": "\" Leveraging Keyword-Based Matching for Effective Disaster Tweet Analysis: A Comparative Study\"\n\nor \n\n\" Keyword-Driven Approach for Situational Awareness in Disaster Response: A Comparison with Learning-Based Methods\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Information shared on Twitter by both affected population (e.g., requesting assistance, warning) and those outside the impact zone (e.g., providing assistance) would help first responders, decision makers, and the public to understand the situation first-hand. Effective use of such information requires timely selection and analysis of tweets that are relevant to a particular disaster. Even though abundant tweets are promising as a data source, it is challenging to automatically identify relevant messages since tweet are short and unstructured, resulting to unsatisfactory classification performance of conventional learning-based approaches. Thus, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm to identify relevant messages based on matching keywords and hashtags, and provide a comparison between matching-based and learning-based approaches. To evaluate the two approaches, we put them into a framework specifically proposed for analyzing diaster-related tweets. Analysis results on eleven datasets with various disaster types show that our technique provides relevant tweets of higher quality and more interpretable results of sentiment analysis tasks when compared to learning approach.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.75}, {"id": "111962", "output": "\"Assessing Portfolio Performance in Fuzzy Environments: A Critical Examination of Non-Statistical Uncertainties and Risk Measurements\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Portfolio Optimization under Fuzzy Uncertainty\", \"Fuzzy Set Theory in Investment Decision Making\"\n\"Risk Analysis in Fuzzy Portfolio Selection\", \"A Fuzzy Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Given a directed acyclic graph representing computations (vertices) and their dependencies (edges), the red-blue pebble game allows sequentially adding, removing, and recoloring red or blue pebbles according to a few rules, where red pebbles represent data in cache (fast memory) and blue pebbles represent data on disk (slow, external memory). Specifically, a vertex can be newly pebbled red if and only if all of its predecessors currently have a red pebble; pebbles can always be removed; and pebbles can be recolored between red and blue (corresponding to reading or writing data between disk and cache, also called I/Os or memory transfers). Given an upper bound on the number of red pebbles at any time (the cache size), the goal is to compute a game execution with the fewest pebble recolorings (memory transfers) that finish with pebbles on a specified subset of nodes (outputs get computed). In this paper, we investigate the complexity of computing this trade-off between red-pebble limit (cache size) and number of recolorings (memory transfers) in general DAGs. First we prove this problem PSPACE-complete through an extension of the proof PSPACE-hardness of black pebbling complexity~\\citeGLT80. Second, we consider a natural restriction on the red-blue pebble game to forbid pebble deletions, or equivalently, forbid discarding data from cache without first writing it to disk. This assumption both simplifies the model and immediately places the trade-off computation problem within NP. Unfortunately, we show that even this restricted version is NP-complete. Finally, we show that the trade-off problem parameterized by the number of transitions is W[1]-hard, meaning that there is likely no algorithm running in a fixed polynomial for constant number of transitions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "111964", "output": "\"Adversarial Style Transfer: Overcoming Mode Collapse in Generative Adversarial Networks\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Style Transfer: A New Frontier in Image Synthesis\", \"Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Style Transfer\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n{ \"common_word_count\": 15, \"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The data integrity checking schemes by a third-party auditor (TPA) have attracted a lot of attention. Sharing data among multiple users (uploaders) is an attractive feature of cloud storage. Considering the scenario of multiple uploaders, privacy-preserving cloud auditing makes it possible for the TPA to publicly verify the data integrity while guarantees that it cannot learn the identity of the data uploader. In this paper, we propose a (t,\u00a0n)-threshold privacy-preserving auditing scheme. Every user could generate a tag piece of a message from the tag generation algorithm individually. To respond a challenge from the TPA, the server needs at least t tag pieces from different users among all n users. Our scheme does not resort to ring signature or group signature techniques. The tag of a message consists of only one element, which is independent of the number of the users within the group. Therefore, the efficiency of tag generation and auditing of our scheme is compatible with an efficient construction (Wu et al., in: International conference on information security practice and experience ISPEC 2016, Springer, New York, 2016). We use the pairing-based cryptography library (PBC library-0.5.14) to implement the scheme and compare both the computation and transmission cost of our scheme with some existing schemes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111967", "output": "\"Lyric Rewriting as Informational Synesthesia: A Novel System for Generating Ad-Specific Songs from News Texts\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this case, the altered song commonly refers to the advertised product or idea. Here we present a system that can automatically reproduce this process: it starts from a novel text, i.e. the daily news, identifies the key concepts therein contained, expands them and then uses this word cloud to replace some of the words in a song, obeying lexical, metrical and rhyming constraints. The new song is then created by merging these new lyrics, sung by a speech synthesizer, with the original backing music. Our evaluation shows that songs created by the system increase the recall of the news they were created from.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111968", "output": "\"Adaptive Reliability Enhancement for MPSoCs: A Dynamic Task- and Core-Specific Approach to Mitigating Device Defects and Dependability Issues\"\n\nor\n\n\"Reliability-Aware Multicore Systems: A 3-Mode Mapping Technique for Efficient Error Mitigation and Resource Optimization\"\n\nor\n\n\"Dynam", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper tackles the dependability challenge by suggesting an adaptive reliability enhancement strategy for multicore systems. We dynamically adapt the reliability enhancement to the actual tasks requirements as well as cores runtime operating conditions. As reliability improvement may adversely affect the parameters of embedded systems, we suggest a runtime recovery method. In fact, we implement a 3-mode mapping technique to limit redundancy overheads through judicious task migrating and dropping. Our experiments show promising results in terms of error mitigation with controllable power and thermal overheads.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111969", "output": "\"Ensemble Learning for Multitask Question Answering in Community Forums: Combining Deep Neural Networks and Conditional Random Fields\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We use deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn meaningful task-specific embeddings, which we then incorporate into a conditional random field (CRF) model for the multitask setting, performing joint learning over a complex graph structure. While DNNs alone achieve competitive results when trained to produce the embeddings, the CRF, which makes use of the embeddings and the dependencies between the tasks, improves the results significantly and consistently across a variety of evaluation metrics, thus showing the complementarity of DNNs and structured learning.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111970", "output": "Based on the provided similar abstract-title pairs and features, I propose the following title:\n\n\"Robustness of Autonomous Vehicles in the Face of Cyber-Physical Attacks: A Game-Theoretic Approach to Adversarial Deep Reinforcement Learning\"\n\nor\n\n\"Adversarial Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics Control:", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, the state estimation process for monitoring AV dynamics, in presence of CP attacks, is analyzed and a novel adversarial deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the robustness of AV dynamics control to CP attacks. The attacker's action and the AV's reaction to CP attacks are studied in a game-theoretic framework. In the formulated game, the attacker seeks to inject faulty data to AV sensor readings so as to manipulate the inter-vehicle optimal safe spacing and potentially increase the risk of AV accidents or reduce the vehicle flow on the roads. Meanwhile, the AV, acting as a defender, seeks to minimize the deviations of spacing so as to ensure robustness to the attacker's actions. Since the AV has no information about the attacker's action and due to the infinite possibilities for data value manipulations, each player uses long short term memory (LSTM) blocks to learn the expected spacing deviation resulting from its own action and feeds this deviation to a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Then, the attacker's RL algorithm chooses the action which maximizes the spacing deviation, while the AV's RL algorithm seeks to find the optimal action that minimizes such deviation. Simulation results show that the proposed adversarial deep RL algorithm can improve the robustness of the AV dynamics control as it minimizes the intra-AV spacing deviation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111971", "output": "Improved Estimation of Covariance and Precision Matrices via Random Matrix Theory for Enhanced Statistical Machine Learning Applications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The present work evaluates the performance of an ensemble of two MLP (multi-layer perceptron) classifiers, each trained on different feature sets. Here, two complementary sets of features, namely, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and Gabor wavelets transform coefficients are extracted from each of the handwritten text-line and word images written in 12 official scripts used in Indian subcontinent, which are then fed into an individual classifier. In order to improve the overall recognition rate, a powerful combination approach based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory is finally employed to fuse the decisions of two MLP classifiers. The performance of the combined decision is compared with those of the individual classifiers, and it is noted that a significant improvement in recognition accuracy (about 4% for text-line data and 6% for word level data) has been achieved by the proposed methodology.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "111973", "output": "Fault-Tolerant Adaptive Routing in Faulty 2-D Tori Networks: A Novel Analytical Model", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

New technologies of integration now enable the design of computing systems with hundreds and even thousands of independent processing elements which can cooperate on the solution of the same problem for a corresponding improvement in the execution time. However, as the number of processing units increases, concerns for reliability and continued operation of the system in the presence of failures must be addressed. Adaptive routing algorithms have been frequently suggested as a means of improving communication performance in large-scale massively parallel computers, Multiprocessors System-on-Chip (MP-SoCs), and peer-to-peer communication networks. Before such schemes can be successfully incorporated in networks, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the factors which affect their performance potential. This paper proposes a novel analytical model to investigate the performance of five prominent adaptive routings in wormhole-switched 2-D tori fortified with an effective scheme suggested by Chalasani and Boppana [S. Chalasani, R.V. Boppana, Adaptive wormhole routing in tori with faults, IEE Proc. Comput. Digit.

The $\\delta$  -antennae largest weight data retrieval ( $\\delta$  ALWDR) problem is to compute a schedule for downloading a subset of data items that has a maximum total weight using $\\delta$  antennae in a given time interval. In this paper, we first give a linear programming (LP) relaxation for $\\delta$  ALWDR and show that it is polynomial-time solvable when every data item appears at most once. We also show that when there exist data items with multiple occurrences, the integrality gap of this LP formula is 2. We then present an approximation algorithm of ratio $1-\\frac{1}{e}$  for the $\\delta$  -antennae $\\gamma$  -separated largest weight data retrieval ( $\\delta$  A $\\gamma$  LWDR) problem, a weaker version of $\\delta$  ALWDR where each block of up to $\\gamma$  data (time) slots is separated by a vacant slot on all channels, applying the techniques called collectively randomized LP rounding and layered DAG construction. We show that $\\delta$  A $\\gamma$  LWDR is ${\\mathcal NP}-$  complete even for the simple case of $\\gamma =2$  , $m=3$  , and equal-weight data items each appearing up to 3 times. Our algorithm runs in time $O(2^{\\gamma}m^{7}T^{3.5}L)$  , where $T$  is the number of time slots, and $L$  is the maximum length of the input. Then, from the simple observation that a ratio $\\alpha$  approximation solution to $\\delta$  A $\\gamma$  LWDR implies a ratio $\\alpha -\\epsilon$  approximation solution to $\\delta$  ALWDR for any fixed $\\epsilon 0$  , we immediately have an approximation algorithm of ratio $1-\\frac{1}{e}-\\epsilon$  for $\\delta$  ALWDR. Our algorithm has the same approximation ratio as the known result in [15] which holds only for $\\delta =1$  , with a significantly lower time complexity of $O(2^{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}m^{7}T^{3.5}L)$  (improved from $O(\\epsilon ^{3.5}m^{\\frac{3.5}{\\epsilon}}T^{3.5}L)$  of [15] ). As a by-product, we also give a fixed-parameter tractable (fpt-)algorithm of time complexity $O(2^{B}m^{7}T^{3.5}L)$  for $\\delta$  ALWDR, where $B$  is the number of time slots that contain data items with multiple occurrences.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.68}, {"id": "111975", "output": "\"Erasure-Correcting Codes for Distributed Storage: Balancing Fault Tolerance and Resource Efficiency\"\n\nor\n\n\"Fault-Tolerant Distributed Storage Codes: A Trade-Off Between Fault Tolerance and Repair Complexity\"\n\nor\n\n\"Distributed Storage Codes with Low Repair Overhead: A Study on Erasure Correction and Fault T", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We maintain the distances from pivots to data objects to be indexed so the pre-computed distances can be used to prune unpromising objects during the search process.

In this paper, we propose a new pivot selection method that incrementally chooses pivots using an eigenvalue-based uncorrelatedness scoring function. We also present a GPU implementation for computing the uncorrelatedness score in order to accelerate the pivot selection process. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method performed better than other previously described pivot selection methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "111977", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\nOptimization of XOR-Majority Graphs for Quantum Circuit Synthesis\nOptimization of Majority-Inverter Graphs for Quantum Circuit Synthesis\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- Use of technical terms like \"structural rewriting", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

XMGs are an extension of Majority-Inverter Graphs (MIGs). Previous work presented an axiomatic system, \u03a9, and its derived transformation rules for manipulation of MIGs. By additionally introducing XOR primitive, the identities of MAJ-XOR operations should be exploited to enable powerful logic rewriting in XMGs. We first proposed two MAJ-XOR identities and exploit its potential optimization opportunities during structural rewriting. Then, we discuss the rewriting rules that can be used for different operations. Finally, we also address structural XOR detection problem in MIG. The experimental results on EPFL benchmark suites show that the proposed method can optimize the size/depth product of XMGs and its mapped look-up tables (LUTs), which in turn benefits the quantum circuit synthesis that using XMG as the underlying logic representations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111978", "output": "Extremal Properties of Long Markov Chains via Monotone Path Argument", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although their resolution limits an analysis at a parcel level, their high temporal rate enables to monitor land use/land cover through the temporal evolution of key biophysical parameters as LAI. However in practice, frame-by-frame estimation is unsatisfactory since the quality of each single data is subjected to undesirable effects due to atmosphere disturbance, sun geometry, viewing geometry, etc. These effects lead to a lack of temporal consistency of resulting time series. The reconstruction of such time series is delicate using conventional interpolation methods since underlying physical processes are not taken into account.

However, many such networks continue to operate on the magnitude spectrogram of a mixture, and produce an estimate of source magnitude spectrograms, to perform source separation. In this paper, we interpret these steps as additional neural network layers and propose an end-to-end source separation network that allows us to estimate the separated speech waveform by operating directly on the raw waveform of the mixture. Furthermore, we also propose the use of masking based end-to-end separation networks that jointly optimize the mask and the latent representations of the mixture waveforms. These networks show a significant improvement in separation performance compared to existing architectures in our experiments. To train these end-to-end models, we investigate the use of composite cost functions that are derived from objective evaluation metrics as measured on waveforms. We present subjective listening test results that demonstrate the improvement attained by using masking based end-to-end networks and also reveal insights into the performance of these cost functions for end-to-end source separation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111981", "output": "\"Effective Diagnosis of Gearbox Faults via Fuzzy Rule-Based Inference System in Condition-Based Maintenance\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n{\"Effective Diagnosis of Gearbox Faults via Fuzzy Rule-Based Inference System in Condition-Based Maintenance\", \"Fuzzy Logic Approach for Gearbox Fault Detection and Diagnosis\", \"Condition-Based Maintenance of", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Gearbox transfers speed and torque from one shaft to another. Hence, correct diagnosis of gearbox faults is an important and critical task for maintenance operators. But, due to nonlinear, time-varying behavior and imprecise measurement information of the systems it is difficult to deal with gearbox failures with precise mathematical equations. Human operators with the aid of their practical experience can handle these complex situations, with only a set of imprecise linguistic if-then rules and imprecise system state. The purpose of this study is to provide a correct and timely diagnosis of gearbox failures in the context of condition based maintenance. The diagnosis is performed by knowledge acquisition through a fuzzy rule-based inference system which could approximate human reasoning. The proposed approach is tested and applied to an experimental data emanating from a gearbox system.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111982", "output": "\"Unveiling the Power of Negative Interactions: Signed Multiplex Link Prediction in Multiplex Networks\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These interactions can be encoded as having a valence with positive links marking interactions such as trust and friendship and negative links denoting distrust or hostility. Extracting information from these negative interactions is challenging since standard topological metrics are often poor predictors of negative link formation, particularly across network layers. In this paper, we introduce a method based on mutual information which enables us to predict both negative and positive relationships. Our experiments show that SMLP (Signed Multiplex Link Prediction) can leverage negative relationship layers in multiplex networks to improve link prediction performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "111983", "output": "\"Monads and Monoids: A Critical Examination of Endofunctorial Structure in the Presence of Non-Deterministic Operators\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Monads and Monoids\", \"Endofunctorial Structure\", \"Computational Effects\", \"Non-Deterministic Operators\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A major challenge in building systems that combine audio models with commodity microphones is to guarantee their accuracy and robustness in the real-world. Besides many environmental dynamics, a primary factor that impacts the robustness of audio models is microphone variability. In this work, we propose Mic2Mic - a machine-learned system component - which resides in the inference pipeline of audio models and at real-time reduces the variability in audio data caused by microphone-specific factors. Two key considerations for the design of Mic2Mic were: a) to decouple the problem of microphone variability from the audio task, and b) put minimal burden on end-users to provide training data. With these in mind, we apply the principles of cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGANs) to learn Mic2Mic using unlabeled and unpaired data collected from different microphones. Our experiments show that Mic2Mic can recover between 66% to 89% of the accuracy lost due to microphone variability for two common audio tasks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "111985", "output": "Verification of Satisfiability for Constrained Horn Clauses through Predicate Pairing and Unfold/Fold Transformation Rules", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, state-of-the-art solvers for CHCs (CHC solvers) based on predicate abstraction are sometimes unable to verify satisfiability because they look for models that are definable in a given class A of constraints, called A-definable models. We introduce a transformation technique, called Predicate Pairing (PP), which is able, in many interesting cases, to transform a set of clauses into an equisatisfiable set whose satisfiability can be proved by finding an A-definable model, and hence can be effectively verified by CHC solvers. We prove that, under very general conditions on A, the unfold/fold transformation rules preserve the existence of an A-definable model, i.e., if the original clauses have an A-definable model, then the transformed clauses have an A-definable model. The converse does not hold in general, and we provide suitable conditions under which the transformed clauses have an A-definable model iff the original ones have an A-definable model. Then, we present the PP strategy which guides the application of the transformation rules with the objective of deriving a set of clauses whose satisfiability can be proved by looking for A-definable models. PP introduces a new predicate defined by the conjunction of two predicates together with some constraints. We show through some examples that an A-definable model may exist for the new predicate even if it does not exist for its defining atomic conjuncts. We also present some case studies showing that PP plays a crucial role in the verification of relational properties of programs (e.g., program equivalence and non-interference). Finally, we perform an experimental evaluation to assess the effectiveness of PP in increasing the power of CHC solving.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "111986", "output": "Evaluating queries over massive amounts of data is a major challenge in the big data era.

Modern massively parallel systems, such as, Spark, organize query answering as a sequence of rounds each consisting of a distinct communication phase followed by a computation phase. The communication phase redistributes data over the available servers, while in the subsequent computation phase each server performs the actual computation on its local data. There is a growing interest in single-round algorithms for evaluating multiway joins where data is first reshuffled over the servers and then evaluated in a parallel but communication-free way. As the amount of communication induced by a reshuffling of the data is a dominating cost in such systems, we introduce a framework for reasoning about data partitioning to detect when we can avoid the data reshuffling step. Specifically, we formalize the decision problems parallel-correctness and transfer of parallel-correctness, provide semantical characterizations, and obtain tight complexity bounds.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111987", "output": "\"Guarding Return-Oriented Programming Attacks with Hardware-Based Message Authentication Code Protection\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

CFI ensures that the execution of a program follows the edges of its predefined static Control-Flow Graph: any deviation that constitutes a CFI violation terminates the application. Despite decades of research effort, there are still several implementation challenges in efficiently protecting the control flow of function returns (Return-Oriented Programming attacks). The set of valid return addresses of frequently called functions can be large and thus an attacker could bend the backward-edge CFI by modifying an indirect branch target to another within the valid return set. This article proposes RAGuard, an efficient and user-transparent hardware-based approach to prevent Return-Oreiented Programming attacks. RAGuard binds a message authentication code (MAC) to each return address to protect its integrity. To guarantee the security of the MAC and reduce runtime overhead: RAGuard (1) computes the MAC by encrypting the signature of a return address with AES-128, (2) develops a key management module based on a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) and a True Random Number Generator (TRNG), and (3) uses a dedicated register to reduce MACs\u2019 load and store operations of leaf functions. We have evaluated our mechanism based on the open-source LEON3 processor and the results show that RAGuard incurs acceptable performance overhead and occupies reasonable area.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "111988", "output": "\"Semantic Frame-Based Approaches for Customizable Dialog Understanding: A Comparative Study of Domain-Adapted and Generic Methods\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In practice, these estimates often differ significantly from the values actually encountered during query execution, leading to poor plan choices and grossly inflated response times. We propose here a conceptually new approach to address this classical problem, wherein the compile-time estimation process is completely eschewed for error-prone selectivities. Instead, from the set of optimal plans in the query\u2019s selectivity error space, a limited subset, called the \u201cplan bouquet,\u201d is selected such that at least one of the bouquet plans is 2-optimal at each location in the space. Then, at run time, a sequence of cost-budgeted executions from the plan bouquet is carried out, eventually finding a plan that executes to completion within its assigned budget. The duration and switching of these executions is controlled by a graded progression of isosurfaces projected onto the optimal performance profile. We prove that this construction results, for the first time, in guarantees on worst-case performance sub-optimality. Moreover, it ensures repeatable execution strategies across different invocations of a query.\n\nWe then present a suite of enhancements to the basic plan bouquet algorithm, including randomized variants, that result in significantly stronger performance guarantees. An efficient isosurface identification algorithm is also introduced to curtail the bouquet construction overheads.\n\nThe plan bouquet approach has been empirically evaluated on both PostgreSQL and a commercial DBMS, over the TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmark environments. Our experimental results indicate that it delivers substantial improvements in the worst-case behavior, without impairing the average-case performance, as compared to the native optimizers of these systems. Moreover, it can be implemented using existing optimizer infrastructure, making it relatively easy to incorporate in current database engines.\n\nOverall, the plan bouquet approach provides novel performance guarantees that open up new possibilities for robust query processing.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.69}, {"id": "111990", "output": "\"Optimizing Virtual Network Function Placement for High-Throughput and Low-Cost Deployment in NFV Environments\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The decoupling of network functions from dedicated middleboxes into software entities has led the Service Providers to offer highly specialized services tailored to the needs of the end users. However, in order to achieve the high performance that the expensive hardware appliances can guarantee, an efficient virtualized network functions (VNF) deployment should be performed. This paper proposes a novel VNF placement approach with the goal to minimize the deployment cost and maximize the achieved throughput. Results reveal the need of considering the throughput degradation when consolidating multiple VNFs on the same server in order to increase the overall performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111991", "output": "\"Maximum Induced Copies of a Graph in a Graph of a Given Size\"\n\nor\n\n\"The Maximum Number of Induced Copies of a Graph in a Graph of n Vertices\"\n\nor\n\n\"Induced Copies of a Graph in Graphs of a Given Vertex Count\"\n\nor\n\n\"Maximal Induced Subgraphs of", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Over the past years, many promising solutions have been proposed but they all suffer from the drawback of new infrastructure costs, setup and maintenance, or are difficult to implement due to FCC regulations. In this paper, we propose a novel Wireless Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) technique which uses existing infrastructure to embed information into existing wireless signals to communicate with IoT devices with negligible impact on the original signal and zero spectrum overhead. We explore the design space for wireless QIM and evaluate the performance of embedding information in TV, FM and AM radio broadcast signals under different conditions. We demonstrate that we can embed messages at up to 8-200 kbps with negligible impact on the audio and video quality of the original FM, AM and TV signals respectively.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111993", "output": "\"Automating High-Level Program Difference Analysis via Rule-Based Differencing\"\n\nor\n\n\"Systematic Change Representation in Program Differencing: A Rule-Based Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Enabling Programmers to Reason about Changes: A Rule-Based Program Differencing Framework\"\n\nor\n\n\"High-Level Program Difference Analysis via Logic", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Reasoning about program changes is challenging as there is a significant gap between how programmers think about changes and how existing program differencing tools represent such changes. For example, even though modification of a locking protocol is conceptually simple and systematic at a code level, diff extracts scattered text additions and deletions per file. To enable programmers to reason about program differences at a high level, this paper proposes a rule-based program differencing approach that automatically discovers and represents systematic changes as logic rules. To demonstrate the viability of this approach, we instantiated this approach at two different abstraction levels in Java: first at the level of application programming interface (API) names and signatures, and second at the level of code elements (e.g., types, methods, and fields) and structural dependences (e.g., method-calls, field-accesses, and subtyping relationships). The benefit of this approach is demonstrated through its application to several open source projects as well as a focus group study with professional software engineers from a large e-commerce company.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "111994", "output": "\"Structure-based Nonlocal Image Representation with Graph Nuclear Norm Regularization\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The nonlocal prior is extracted from each group consisting of patches with similar intensities. Grouping patches based on intensity similarity, however, gives rise to disturbance and inaccuracy in estimation of the true images. To address this problem, we propose a structure-based low-rank model with graph nuclear norm regularization. We exploit the local manifold structure inside a patch and group the patches by the distance metric of manifold structure. With the manifold structure information, a graph nuclear norm regularization is established and incorporated into a low-rank approximation model. We then prove that the graph-based regularization is equivalent to a weighted nuclear norm and the proposed model can be solved by a weighted singular-value thresholding algorithm. Extensive experiments on additive white Gaussian noise removal and mixed noise removal demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better performance than several state-of-the-art algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111995", "output": "Enhanced Password Security through Device-Enhanced Key Agreement: A Novel Approach to Mitigate Password Manager Compromise", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Existing password managers work well to defeat offline dictionary attacks upon web service compromise, assuming the use of high-entropy passwords is enforced. However, they are vulnerable to leakage of all passwords in the event the device is compromised, due to the need to store the passwords encrypted under the master password and/or the need to input the master password to the device (as in smartphone managers). Evidence exists that password managers can be attractive attack targets.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to password management, called SPHINX, which remains secure even when the password manager itself has been compromised. In SPHINX, the information stored on the device is information theoretically independent of the user's master password an attacker breaking into the device learns no information about the master password or the user's site-specific passwords. Moreover, an attacker with full control of the device, even at the time the user interacts with it, learns nothing about the master password the password is not entered into the device in plaintext form or in any other way that may leak information on it. Unlike existing managers, SPHINX produces strictly high-entropy passwords and makes it compulsory for the users to register these randomized passwords with the web services, hence fully defeating offline dictionary attack upon service compromise. The design and security of SPHINX is based on the device-enhanced PAKE model of Jarecki et al. that provides the theoretical basis for this construction and is backed by rigorous cryptographic proofs of security.While SPHINX is suitable for different device and online platforms, in this paper, we report on its concrete instantiation on smartphones given their popularity and trustworthiness as password managers (or even two-factor authentication). We present the design, implementation and performance evaluation of SPHINX, offering prototype browser plugins, smartphone apps and transparent device-client communication. Based on our inspection analysis, the overall user experience of SPHINX improves upon current managers. We also report on a lab-based usability study of SPHINX, which indicates that users' perception of SPHINX security and usability is high and satisfactory when compared to regular password-based authentication. Finally, we discuss how SPHINX may be extended to an online service for the purpose of back-up or as an independent password manager.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "111996", "output": "Minimizing Energy and Weighted Flow-Time in Online Scheduling of Jobs on Unrelated Machines with Dynamic Speed Scaling", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

(2012), along with a matching lower bound of \u03a9(\u03b1 / log \u03b1). Further, in the resource augmentation model, with a 1+ \u03b5 speed up, we give a 2(1/\u03b5 + 1) competitive algorithm, with essentially the same techniques, improving the bound of 1 + O(1/\u03b52) by Gupta et al. (2010) and matching the bound of Anand et al. (2012) for the special case of fixed speed unrelated machines. Unlike the previous results most of which used an amortized local competitiveness argument or dual fitting methods, we use a primal-dual method, which is useful not only to analyze the algorithms but also to design the algorithm itself.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "111997", "output": "Smart Thermal Management for Heterogeneous Multicores: Maximizing Performance under Temperature Constraints", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, due to the discontinuation of Dennard scaling, on-chip power densities are continuously increasing along with technology scaling, and hence on-chip temperatures are elevated. Therefore, several thermal management techniques have emerged to keep the temperature of the chip within safe limits. These techniques, however, lead to performance losses which ultimately erase a big portion of the expected performance gains from the heterogeneous multicores. Thus, it is indispensable to deploy thermal management techniques that are able to make efficient decisions which satisfy temperature constraints while at the same time maximizing the performance. This paper presents smart thermal management techniques for heterogeneous multicores that exploit relevant information about several heterogeneity parameters at the chip level and at the application level to increase thermal efficiency\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n.

Data selection can improve the accuracy of classic hand-eye calibration, and make it possible in the first place in situations where the standard approach of manually selecting positions is inconvenient or even impossible, especially when using continuously recorded data. A variety of methods is proposed, which differ from each other in the dimensionality of the vector quantization compared to the degrees of freedom of the rotation representation, and how the rotation angle is incorporated. The performance of the proposed vector quantization based data selection methods is evaluated using data obtained from a manually moved optical tracking system (hand) and an endoscopic camera (eye).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "111999", "output": "\"Optimizing Self-Adaptation in Cyber-Physical Systems via Machine Learning and Pareto-Optimization\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Assumptions about parts of the system made at design time may not hold at run time, especially when a system is deployed for long periods (e.g., over decades). Self-adaptation is designed to find reconfigurations of systems to handle such run-time inconsistencies. Planners can be used to find and enact optimal reconfigurations in such an evolving context. However, for systems that are highly configurable, such planning becomes intractable due to the size of the adaptation space. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we explore an approach that (a) uses machine learning to find Pareto-optimal configurations without needing to explore every configuration and (b) restricts the search space to such configurations to make planning tractable. We explore this in the context of robot missions that need to consider task timeliness and energy consumption. An independent evaluation shows that our approach results in high-quality adaptation plans in uncertain and adversarial environments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111000", "output": "\"Synthesizing Realistic Electron Microscope Images via Two-Stage Generative Adversarial Networks with Supervised Label-Image Pairs\"\n\nor \n\n\"Realistic EM Image Generation via Two-Stage GANs: A Supervised Approach to Dense Annotation\"\n\nor \n\n\"Generative Modeling of Electron Microscope Images", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we focus on building generative models of electron microscope (EM) images in which the positions of cell membranes and mitochondria have been densely annotated, and propose a two-stage procedure that produces realistic images using Generative Adversarial Networks (or GANs) in a supervised way. In the first stage, we synthesize a label \"image\" given a noise \"image\" as input, which then provides supervision for EM image synthesis in the second stage. The full model naturally generates label-image pairs. We show that accurate synthetic EM images are produced using assessment via (1) shape features and global statistics, (2) segmentation accuracies, and (3) user studies. We also demonstrate further improvements by enforcing a reconstruction loss on intermediate synthetic labels and thus unifying the two stages into one single end-to-end framework.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111001", "output": "\"Unveiling the Invisible: Inferring Social Relationships from Mobile App Data and its Implications for Privacy Protection\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we investigate how much an advertiser can infer about users\u2019 social and community relationships. After one month\u2019s user study involving about 190 most popular Android apps, we find that an advertiser can infer 90% of the social relationships. We further propose a privacy leakage inference framework and use real mobility traces and Foursquare data to quantify the consequences of privacy leakage. We find that achieving 90% inference accuracy of the social and community relationships requires merely 3 weeks\u2019 user data. Finally, we present a real-time privacy leakage visualization tool that captures and displays the spatial\u2013temporal characteristics of the leakages. The discoveries underscore the importance of early adoption of privacy protection mechanisms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "1111002", "output": "\"Assessing the Impact of Goal-Oriented and Non-Goal Oriented Modelling Methods in Legal and Regulatory Compliance: A Systematic Literature Mapping Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Exploring the Benefits and Drawbacks of Modelling Methods in Compliance Modelling, Checking, Analysis, and Enactment Tasks: A Study", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As this domain continues to grow and mature, and with more modelling methods introduced to support compliance tasks, important questions need to be asked. What exactly are these methods used for? Where have they been applied? What benefits do they offer? This paper explores how goal-oriented and non-goal-oriented modelling methods have been used for legal and regulatory compliance, and identifies their main claimed benefits and drawbacks based on the kind of compliance tasks they perform. Using a systematic literature mapping approach, we evaluated 103 articles describing the use of modelling methods obtained from a pool of 286 articles. The results indicate that modelling methods focus on the intent of a law, but goal-oriented modelling methods do so while also reflecting the structure of a law, generally with substantial benefits for all compliance tasks. In addition, whereas modelling methods are used for compliance modelling, checking, analysis and enactment tasks, our analysis indicates that the coverage of these methods is more frequent in the healthcare domain with 55% of the articles reviewed targeting it. In terms of the contexts modelling methods address, privacy has the highest level of attention with a focus from 54% of the reviewed articles. The articles reviewed revealed a total of 60 different laws and regulations from 14 different countries, with 62% focusing on privacy. Moreover, while 82% of the articles reviewed addressed concerns of regulated parties, only 12% addressed the concerns of regulators, and 6% addressed concerns of both regulating and regulated parties. This study highlights the benefits and drawbacks of both types of\u00a0modelling methods and identifies potential benefits and common drawbacks that will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in the selection of modelling methods or in the identification of selection criteria. Finally, the mapping results emphasize the need for more studies outside of healthcare, that are related to contexts other than privacy, that target compliance enactment tasks or that take the concerns of regulators into consideration.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.18}, {"id": "1111003", "output": "\"Depth Estimation via Self-Supervised Learning with Structural Stability and Feature Scaling: Overcoming Challenges in Endoscopic Videos\"\n\nor\n\n\"Appearance Flow-based Depth Estimation for Endoscopic Videos with AFNet and Feature Scaling Module\"\n\nor\n\n\"Self-Supervised Depth Estimation for Endoscopic Videos: A Novel Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These techniques still face significant challenges, however, when applied directly to endoscopic videos because of the brightness variations from frame to frame and inadequate representation learning during the training phase. Inspired by the optical flow for motion alignment between adjacent frames, we design a AFNet with structural stability loss and residual-based smoothness loss to learn the appearance flow across adjacent frames, which handles the brightness inconsistency issue efficaciously. In addition, we propose a novel self-attention mechanism named feature scaling module to alleviate the inadequate representation learning problem. In a comparison study to the current state-of-the-art self-supervised methods explored for urban videos on the SCARED dataset, the developed model surpasses existing methods by a large margin.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111004", "output": "Content-Aware and Depth-Aware Image Adaptation for Preserving Local Scene Content on Curved Displays", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, existing curved surface projections are frequently prone to geometric distortion or loss of content. This paper presents a content-aware and depth-aware image adaptation solution for curved displays. An efficient optimization approach of image deformation is proposed to preserve local scene content and to minimize scene geometry distortion. To follow the original 3D perception of objects in different depth layers, the depth information is re-mapped for individual content scaling. Objective evaluation results reveal that our approach can effectively preserve foreground objects. We also perform a subjective evaluation of the proposed solution, and compare it to two alternative mapping methods, which are tested on different curvatures on both a traditional screen and an ad-hoc curvature-controllable curved display. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other existing mapping methods for immersive display of rectangle images on curved screens.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111005", "output": "Fairness-Constrained Real-Time Secret Image Sharing Scheme with Steganography for Enhanced Security and Integrity.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While less than t shares can know nothing about the secret, the problem arises when there are more than t shares. The cheater can use this to put their share in the last. Therefore, fairness is a important objective of the secret image sharing. Tian et al. proposed the fairness secret sharing scheme in 2012. However, they generated v polynomials for one secret data and performed v-times to reconstruct the polynomial using Lagrange interpolation. Therefore, their scheme is unsuitableness in the real-time processing. The proposed scheme generates one polynomial for the one secret data based on the fairness concept of Tian et al.\u2019s scheme. For the providing fairness, the proposed scheme hides the verification value at the random coefficient of the polynomial. During the secret image reconstruction procedure, each shadow image brought by a participant is verified for its fairness using XOR operation. Our scheme not only satisfies the fairness, but also is suitable for the real-time process. This helps to detect the participant from intentional provision of a false or cheating. In addition, our scheme uses the steganography technique for increasing the security protection purpose. The proposed scheme as a whole offers a high secure and effective mechanism for the secret image sharing that is not found in existing secret image sharing methods. In the experimental result, PSNR of the proposed scheme is average 44.67 dB. It is higher 4 dB than the previous schemes. The embedding capacity is also similar to the other schemes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "1111006", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Adaptive Backstepping Event-Triggered Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems with Intermittent Output Signal\"\n\nor\n\n\"Event-Triggered Adaptive Backstepping Control with Dynamic Filtering for Nonlinear Systems in Nonnormal Form\"\n\nor\n\n\"Design", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The primary objective of this article is, by using intermittent output signal only, to build a backstepping adaptive event-triggered feedback control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. To do so, we need to tackle three technical obstacles. First, the nature of the event triggering makes the transmitted output signal discontinuous, rendering the regular recursive backstepping design method inapplicable as the repetitive differentiation of virtual control signals is literally undefined. Second, the effects arisen from the event-triggering action must be properly accommodated, but the current compensating method only works for systems in normal form, thus a new method needs to be developed in order to handle nonnormal form systems. Third, as only intermittent output signal is available, and at the same time, the impacts of certain terms containing unknown parameters (arising from event triggering) need to be compensated, it is rather challenging to design a suitable state observer. To circumvent these difficulties, we employ the dynamic filtering technique to avoid the differentiation of virtual control signals in the backstepping design, construct a new compensation scheme to deal with the effects of output triggering, and build a new form of state observer to facilitate the development of output feedback control. It is shown that, with the derived adaptive backstepping output-triggered control, all the closed-loop signals are ensured bounded and the transient system performance in the mean square error sense can be adjusted by appropriately adjusting design parameters. The benefits and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are also validated by numerical simulation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111007", "output": "\"Ontological Framework for Efficient Software Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (SW-FMEA): A Novel Approach to Overcome Complexity and Enhance Development Life-Cycle Cohesion\"\n\nor\n\n\"Formalizing Software Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (SW-FMEA) through Ontological Modeling: A Tool for Streamlining Development Processes\"\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although FMEA has been thought for hardware, its use is also advocated for software SW-FMEA. However, this involves several major hurdles such as the complexity of functional requirements and the difficulty to identify failure modes of SW components. We present an approach for efficient and effective manipulation of data involved in the SW-FMEA process, introducing an ontological model that formalises concepts comprised in the analysis and provides a common conceptual framework supporting cohesion across different stages of a development life-cycle. The ontological model opened the way to the implementation of a tool, which automates SW-FMEA providing support for basic and advanced functionalities, fastening the analysis. Use of the tool in a real SW development process is discussed at the end of the paper.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111008", "output": "\"Non-Asymptotic Bounds on Guessing Subject to Distortion: A Moment-Based Approach\"\n\nor \n\n\"Renyi Entropy-Based Analysis of Guessing Subject to Distortion: Non-Asymptotic Achievability and Converse Bounds\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we consider collections that originate from extracting URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) from Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Specifically, we seek to provide insight about the retrievability of URIs of news stories found on Google, and to answer two main questions: first, can one \"refind\" the same URI of a news story (for the same query) from Google after a given time? Second, what is the probability of finding a story on Google over a given period of time? To answer these questions, we issued seven queries to Google every day for over seven months (2017-05-25 to 2018-01-12) and collected links from the first five SERPs to generate seven collections for each query. The queries represent public interest stories: \"healthcare bill,\" \"manchester bombing,\" \"london terrorism,\" \"trump russia,\" \"travel ban,\" \"hurricane harvey,\" and \"hurricane irma.\" We tracked each URI in all collections over time to estimate the discoverability of URIs from the first five SERPs. Our results showed that the daily average rate at which stories were replaced on the default Google SERP ranged from 0.21 - 0.54, and a weekly rate of 0.39 - 0.79, suggesting the fast replacement of older stories by newer stories. The probability of finding the same URI of a news story after one day from the initial appearance on the SERP ranged from 0.34 - 0.44. After a week, the probability of finding the same news stories diminishes rapidly to 0.01 - 0.11. In addition to the reporting of these probabilities, we also provide two predictive models for estimating the probability of finding the URI of an arbitrary news story on SERPs as a function of time. The web archiving community considers link rot and content drift important reasons for collection building. Similarly, our findings suggest that due to the difficulty in retrieving the URIs of news stories from Google, collection building that originates from search engines should begin as soon as possible in order to capture the first stages of events, and should persist in order to capture the evolution of the events, because it becomes more difficult to find the same news stories with the same queries on Google, as time progresses.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "1111010", "output": "Network Function Virtualization in Cloud Networks: A Study on Throughput Maximization and Cost Optimization\n\n</similarpairs>\n\n</features>\n\n</otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As a key ingredient of such a trend, network function virtualization (NFV) is shown to enable elastic and inexpensive network services for next-generation networks, through deploying flexible virtualized network functions (VNFs) running in virtual computing platforms. Different VNFs can be chained together to form different service chains for different network services, to meet various user data routing demands. From the service provider point of view, such services are usually implemented by VNF instances in a cloudlet network consisting of a set of data centers and switches. In this paper we consider provisioning network services in a cloud network for implementing VNF instances of service chains, where the VNF instances in each data center are partitioned into K types with each hosting one type of service chain. We investigate the throughput maximization problem with the aim to admit as many user requests as possible while minimizing the implementation cost of the requests, assuming that limited numbers of instances of each service chain have been instantiated in data centers. We first show the problem is NP-Complete, and propose an optimal algorithm for a special case of the problem when all requests have identical packet rates; otherwise, we devise two approximation algorithms with approximation ratios, depending on whether the packet traffic of each request is splittable. If arrivals of future requests are not known in advance, we study the online throughput maximization problem by proposing an online algorithm with a competitive ratio. We finally conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by simulations. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms are promising.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "1111011", "output": "Exploring Uncertainty Bounds: A Novel Approach to Optimism in Reinforcement Learning", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For exploitation, it is well known that the Bellman equation connects the value at any time-step to the expected value at subsequent time-steps. In this paper we consider a similar uncertainty Bellman equation (UBE), which connects the uncertainty at any time-step to the expected uncertainties at subsequent time-steps, thereby extending the potential exploratory benefit of a policy beyond individual time-steps. We prove that the unique fixed point of the UBE yields an upper bound on the variance of the estimated value of any fixed policy. This bound can be much tighter than traditional count-based bonuses that compound standard deviation rather than variance.

Previous analog neural network models were composed of the operational amplifier and fixed resistance. It is difficult to change the connecting weight of network. In this study, we used analog electronic AC circuits. The connecting weights describe the voltage and input signal describe the frequency. It is easy to change the connection coefficient. This model works only on analog electronic circuits. It can finish the learning process in a very short time and this model will enable more flexible learning. However, the structure of this model is only one input and one output network. We improved the number of unit and network layer.

This kind of applications is constrained in terms of Quality of Service (QoS). Existing works in this area are mostly designed for mobile ad hoc networks, which, unlike WMNs, are mainly sensitive to energy and mobility. However, WMNs have their specific characteristics (e.g. static routers and heavy traffic load), which require dedicated QoS protocols. This paper proposes a novel traffic regulation scheme for multimedia support in WMNs. The proposed scheme aims to regulate the traffic sending rate according to the network state, based on the buffer evolution at mesh routers and on the priority of each traffic type. By monitoring the buffer evolution at mesh routers, our scheme is able to predict possible congestion, or QoS violation, early enough before their occurrence; each flow is then regulated according to its priority and to its QoS requirements. The idea behind the proposed scheme is to maintain lightly loaded buffers in order to minimize the queuing delays, as well as, to avoid congestion. Moreover, the regulation process is made smoothly in order to ensure the continuity of real time and interactive services. We use the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS), known by its adequacy to uncertain environments, to make suitable regulation decisions. The performance of our scheme is proved through extensive simulations in different network and traffic load scales.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "1111015", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Message Authentication Scheme Based on Cryptographically Secure CRC\", \"A Secure CRC-Based Approach for Message Authentication\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n  {\"use_of_words\": [\"security\", \"authentication\", \"cyclic\", \"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We provide a detailed quantitative analysis of the achieved security as a function of message and CRC sizes. The results show that the presented scheme is particularly suitable for the authentication of short messages.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.13}, {"id": "1111016", "output": "Optimizing Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing: A History-Based Dynamic Approach to Mitigate the Tension between Allocation Efficiency and Continuity", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Cloud customers can flexibly purchase additional resources when needed, and trim these down when the need has past, while Cloud providers can direct resources when and where customers might require. One aspect which poses a challenge to this capability is the allocation process itself, which can be costly in terms of time and energy. Indeed, both provider and customer would prefer if resource allocation would be continuous, fast and with low energy overhead. Since this is not the case, there is an inherent tension between limiting the number of allocation events and efficient resource utilization.This paper considers this tension using several different models, and proposes a history-based dynamic allocation scheme that minimizes the number of resource allocation transition points for both average and adversarial use cases. We prove performance bounds and use extensive simulation to study the performance of our scheme.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "1111017", "output": "Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent: Mitigating Disparate Impact on Underrepresented and Complex Classes and Subgroups", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As a consequence, DPSGD has disparate impact: the accuracy of a model trained using DPSGD tends to decrease more on these classes and subgroups vs. the original, non-private model. If the original model is unfair in the sense that its accuracy is not the same across all subgroups, DPSGD exacerbates this unfairness. In this work, we study the inequality in utility loss due to differential privacy, which compares the changes in prediction accuracy w.r.t. each group between the private model and the non-private model. We analyze the cost of privacy w.r.t. each group and explain how the group sample size along with other factors is related to the privacy impact on group accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a modified DPSGD algorithm, called DPSGD-F, to achieve differential privacy, equal costs of differential privacy, and good utility. DPSGD-F adaptively adjusts the contribution of samples in a group depending on the group clipping bias such that differential privacy has no disparate impact on group accuracy. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our removal algorithm on achieving equal costs of differential privacy with satisfactory utility.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "1111018", "output": "\"Regularizing Speaker Embeddings with Gaussian-Constrained Training for Improved Verification Performance\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, two potential problems of these neural models deserve more investigation. Firstly, both models suffer from 'information leak', which means that some parameters participating in model training will be discarded during inference, i.e, the layers that are used as the classifier. Secondly, these models do not regulate the distribution of the derived speaker vectors. This 'unconstrained distribution' may degrade the performance of the subsequent scoring component, e. g., PLDA. This paper proposes a Gaussian-constrained training approach that ( 1) discards the parametric classifier, and ( 2) enforces the distribution of the derived speaker vectors to be Gaussian. Our experiments on the VoxCeleb and SITW databases demonstrated that this new training approach produced more representative and regular speaker embeddings, leading to consistent performance improvement.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "1111019", "output": "Optimizing Network Function Virtualization (NFV) Placement and Traffic Routing under Time-Varying Network States with QoS Requirements", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Analyses of digital traces typically aim to find user traits such as age, gender, and nationality to derive common preferences. We investigate to which extent the music listening habits of users of the social music platform Last.fm can be used to predict their age, gender, and nationality. We propose a feature modeling approach building on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for artist listening information and artist tags combined with additionally extracted features. We show that we can substantially outperform a baseline majority voting approach and can compete with existing approaches. Further, regarding prediction accuracy vs. available listening data we show that even one single listening event per user is enough to outperform the baseline in all prediction tasks. We also compare the performance of our algorithm for different user groups and discuss possible prediction errors and how to mitigate them. We conclude that personal information can be derived from music listening information, which indeed can help better tailoring recommendations, as we illustrate with the use case of a music recommender system that can directly utilize the user attributes predicted by our algorithm to increase the quality of it\u2019s recommendations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.05}, {"id": "1111021", "output": "\"Verifying Regular Language Representations in Coq: A Comprehensive Study of WS1S, Automata, and Closure Properties\"\n\nor\n\n\"Constructive Type Theory for Regular Language Theory: A Proof-Theoretic Approach to WS1S, Automata, and Regular Expressions\"\n\nor\n\n\"Automata and Regular", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The requirement for an efficient data dissemination in vehicular environment is ensuring the highest data reachability, using the minimum network resources within a short end to end delay. To meet these properties, researchers have addressed the data dissemination challenges, mainly the famous broadcast storm, which has lead to a wide variety of solutions. In this work, we present two Simple and Efficient Adaptive data Dissemination protocols called SEAD1 and SEAD2 that combine a probabilistic and a delay based approach. The originality of these protocols is that they can be adaptively tuned according to the VANET applications\u2019 requirements. Therefore, a rigorous performance evaluation of the protocols is proposed through an analytic model and a large set of NS3 simulations. The analytic results show excellent fits to the simulation results which confirm the accuracy of the proposed model. Moreover, based on our analytic model we became able to thoroughly study the protocols parameters\u2019 behavior and derive an accurate configuration. Thereby, a proper trade-off between the packet delivery ratio and the redundancy ratio is possible in attempt to tune the protocols performance according to the application criticality level.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111023", "output": "\"Ensemble Classifier Construction via Stacked Generalization and Parallel Processing with GEP and Open-Source Genetic Programming Libraries\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Individual application components of such services may run in different isolated runtime environments, such as chrooted jails or application containers, and may need access to system resources and the ability to collaborate and coordinate with each other in a regulated and secure manner. We implemented an access control framework for policy formulation, management, and enforcement that allows access to OS resources and also permits controlled collaboration and coordination for service components running in disjoint containerized environments under a single Linux OS server instance. The framework consists of two models and the policy formulation is based on the concept of policy classes for ease of administration and enforcement. The policy classes are managed and enforced through a Linux Policy Machine (LPM) that acts as the centralized reference monitor and provides a uniform interface for accessing system resources and requesting application data and control objects. We present the details of our framework and also discuss the preliminary implementation to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "1111025", "output": "\"Genetic Algorithm for Efficient Column Subset Selection in High-Dimensional Data: A Novel Approach for Image Classification\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Genetic Algorithm for Efficient Feature Selection\", \"Column Subset Selection using Genetic Optimization\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n{word_count: 69, average_sentence_length: 15.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Fixed-length subset selection is a family of combinatorial optimization problems that involve selection of a set of unique objects from a larger superset. Feature selection, p-median problem, and column subset selection problem are three examples of hard problems that involve search for fixed-length subsets. Due to their high complexity, exact algorithms are often infeasible to solve real-world instances of these problems and approximate methods based on various heuristic and metaheuristic (e.g. nature-inspired) approaches are often employed. Selecting column subsets from massive data matrices is an important technique useful for construction of compressed representations and low rank approximations of high-dimensional data. Search for an optimal subset of exactly k columns of a matrix, \\(A^{m\\times n}\\), \\(k < n\\), is a well-known hard optimization problem with practical implications for data processing and mining. It can be used for unsupervised feature selection, dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and so on. A compressed representation of raw real-world data can contribute, for example, to reduction of algorithm training times in supervised learning, to elimination of overfitting in classification and regression, to facilitation of better data understanding, and to many other benefits. This paper proposes a novel genetic algorithm for the column subset selection problem and evaluates it in a series of computational experiments with image classification. The evaluation shows that the proposed modifications improve the results obtained by artificial evolution.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111026", "output": "Optimizing Energy Efficiency and Performance of Multithreaded Runge-Kutta Methods on Recent Intel Processors", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

One challenging yet important task is to identify k entities that are most closely associated with a given query entity based on their digital traces. We propose a suite of indexing techniques and algorithms to enable fast query processing for this problem at scale. We first define a generic family of functions measuring the association between entities, and then propose algorithms to transform digital traces into a lower-dimensional space for more efficient computation. We subsequently design a hierarchical indexing structure to organize entities in a way that closely associated entities tend to appear together. We then develop algorithms to process top-k queries utilizing the index. We theoretically analyze the pruning effectiveness of the proposed methods based on a mobility model which we propose and validate in real life situations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets at scale, evaluating the performance of our techniques both analytically and experimentally, confirming the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over other applicable approaches across a variety of parameter settings and datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111028", "output": "Revisiting the Provided Features:\n\n<similarpairs>\n1. \"A Novel Steganographic Method Using Delaunay Triangulation and Histogram-Shifting\"\n2. \"Prediction Error-Based Data Hiding in Images Using 3D Delaunay Mesh\"\n3. \"Robust Data Hiding in Images", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Because the statistical properties of the prediction errors along the embedding direction are significantly altered due to the shifting operation, the existing PHS-based methods are vulnerable to some steganalyzers. The proposed method exploits a set of key-selected referential pixels to construct a 3D Delaunay mesh to obtain the prediction errors. The presence of the altered statistical properties along the embedding direction is unrevealed because the same set of prediction errors cannot be reconstructed. A selective embedment mechanism is used to control the embedding regions in the cover image for evading the detection of the steganalyzers based on low-amplitude stego signal. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method not only provides better payload and image quality than the existing PHS-based methods, but is also robust to the detection of modern steganalyzers such as histogram analysis and SPAM.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111029", "output": "\"Overcoming the Challenges of Dense Annotation in User-Generated Videos: A Novel Dataset for Fine-Grained Video Content Analysis\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, existing works are limited to evaluating with either small datasets or indirect metrics, such as the performance over images. The underlying reason is that the construction of a large-scale video dataset with dense annotation is tricky and costly. In this paper, we address several main issues in annotating objects and relations in user-generated videos, and propose an annotation pipeline that can be executed at a modest cost. As a result, we present a new dataset, named VidOR, consisting of 10k videos (84 hours) together with dense annotations that localize 80 categories of objects and 50 categories of predicates in each video.

Nevertheless, deciding when to invest in IT security is rather difficult for executives because of the irreversibility of spending and uncertainty of IT security investments performance. A review of the literature on IT security investments reveals that previous studies largely neglected the strategy and timing of investments. Basing on real options theory, this research examines IT security investments for the commercial exploitation strategy versus the IT security improvement strategy in terms of proactive and reactive investments. An event methodology is used to estimate the effect of IT security investment timing on the stock performance of the investments. Our results show that reactive investments for IT security improvement and proactive investments for commercial exploitation earn positive abnormal returns. Moreover, the market reacts more positively to aligned than misaligned IT security investments. The implications of the research findings are presented and discussed.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111031", "output": "\"Evolutionary Strategies for Efficient Pattern Formation and Stability in 2D Cellular Automata with Mobile Agents\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Initially the field is colored white and agents are randomly placed. They have the task to color the whole field into black in shortest time. The objective is to find algorithms that (1) can form the black\u2013pattern, (2) keep it stable and then (3) change into a global state where all agents stop their activity. Four levels of stability are distinguished, depending on the grade of inactivity after having formed the pattern. For systems with up to four agents we found such algorithms by applying genetic algorithms (GA) and manual post fine tuning. Performances and simulations of these algorithms are presented.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "1111032", "output": "\"Reviewing the Foundations of Word Spotting: A Comprehensive Analysis of Core Steps, Boosting Mechanisms, and Evaluation Metrics for Document Indexing\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Vast collections of documents available in image format need to be indexed for information retrieval purposes. In this framework, word spotting is an alternative solution to optical character recognition (OCR), which is rather inefficient for recognizing text of degraded quality and unknown fonts usually appearing in printed text, or writing style variations in handwritten documents. Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in addressing document indexing using word spotting which is reflected by the continuously increasing number of approaches. However, there exist very few comprehensive studies which analyze the various aspects of a word spotting system. This work aims to review the recent approaches as well as fill the gaps in several topics with respect to the related works. The nature of texts and inherent challenges addressed by word spotting methods are thoroughly examined. After presenting the core steps which compose a word spotting system, we investigate the use of retrieval enhancement techniques based on relevance feedback which improve the retrieved results. Finally, we present the datasets which are widely used for word spotting, we describe the evaluation standards and measures applied for performance assessment and discuss the results achieved by the state of the art.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "1111033", "output": "\"Learning from Large-Scale Datasets: A Comparative Analysis of Supervised and Self-Supervised Methods for Visual Feature Learning in Computer Vision Applications\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In order to solve the mentioned problems, a new spectrum sensing algorithm based on the double threshold and two-stage detection strategy under the condition of low SNR is put forward in this paper. First of all, when a false-alarm probability is given, the sampling length is found out under the different SNR level. Then the first stage detection is carried out by designing the two detection threshold. Finally the second stage detection is implemented for the center portion of the double threshold and the final detection result is gotten. Simulations and analysis show that, when the SNR is low, the proposed algorithm not only has a short average sensing time but also has a good performance in a small false-alarm probability constraint condition and low algorithm complexity.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "1111035", "output": "\"Assessing the Robustness of Smoothing in Phrase Translation Models: A Vocabulary-Agnostic Analysis\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Assessing the Robustness of Smoothing in Phrase Translation Models\", \"Evaluating the Effectiveness of Vocabulary Reduction in Phrase Translation Systems\"],\n[\"The Impact of Vocabulary", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To improve the secrecy performance, artificial noise (AN) aided transmission is adopted at each BS. Based on the stochastic geometry, we first derive the closed-form expressions of the connection and secrecy outage probabilities, and then comprehensively analyze the impact of different parameters through asymptotic analysis. It shows that in a low cell-load case, deploying more BSs will improve the connection and secrecy outage performance, and deploying more transmit antennas at each BS will only improve the connection outage performance. For a fixed-rate transmission, the condition under which AN becomes unnecessary is derived. We also derive a semi closed-form expression of the lower bound of the achievable average secrecy rate, which is numerically efficient to evaluate. Finally, we extend the study to a high cell-load case and adopt the zero-forcing beamforming scheme to support multi-user transmission. The connection and secrecy outage probabilities are also analyzed. Moreover, the optimal number of users maximizing the secrecy area spectral efficiency is discussed, and it is shown to be a fixed portion of the number of transmit antennas. Simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111037", "output": "\"Optimizing Team Formation in Complex Social Network Applications: A Collaborative Approach to Mitigating Costs and Time Constraints\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Evidences from the Amazon cloud system indicate that \u201cdynamic pricing\u201d would be more profitable than \u201cstatic pricing.\u201d The challenges are: How to set the price in real-time so to maximize revenues? How to estimate the price dependent demand so to optimize the pricing decision? We first design a discrete-time based dynamic pricing scheme and formulate a Markov decision process to characterize the evolving dynamics of the price-dependent demand. We formulate a revenue maximization framework to determine the optimal price and theoretically characterize the \u201cstructure\u201d of the optimal revenue and optimal price.

The interactive approach includes 1) internal interaction to capture the change in implicit contextual information and 2) external interaction to balance grammaticality and the expression of emotion. Qualitative and quantitative experiments with NLPCC2017 show that our model performs better in terms of the content and emotion of replies than several state-of-the-art approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "1111041", "output": "\"High-Resolution Monocular Avatar Creation: Refining Human Form and Texture from Single-View Videos\"\n\nor\n\n\"Single-View Video to Photorealistic Avatar: A Novel Method for High Detail-Preserving Human Creation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Monocular Human Avatar Generation: Enhancing Realism through Facial Landmark Ref", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Experiments show that compression dissimilarity could clearly distinct automatic summaries from human summaries. Compression dissimilarity evaluating measure could evaluate an automatic summary by comparing with high-quality human summaries, or comparing with its original document. The evaluating results are highly correlated with human assessments, and the correlation between compression dissimilarity of summaries and compression dissimilarity of documents can serve as a meaningful measure to evaluate the consistency of an automatic text summarization system.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "1111044", "output": "We present a system that complements virtual reality experiences with passive props, yet still allows modifying the virtual world at runtime.

However, AAM suffers from the generalization problem and has difficulties in images with cluttered backgrounds. In this paper, we introduce two novel constraints into AAM fitting to address the above problems. We first introduce a temporal matching constraint in AAM fitting. In the proposed fitting scheme, the temporal matching enforces an inter-frame local appearance constraint between frames. The resulting model takes advantage of temporal matching's good generalizability, but does not suffer from the mismatched points. To make AAM more stable for cluttered backgrounds, we introduce a color-based face segmentation as a soft constraint. Both constraints effectively improve the AAM tracker's performance, as demonstrated with experiments on various challenging real-world videos.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "1111046", "output": "\"Reifying Delta s: A Formal Model for Safe Composition of Black-Box Rewriting Rules\"\n\nor\n\n\"Delta s in Action: A Framework for Isolated Application of Rewriting Rules\"\n\nor\n\n\"Black-Box Rewriting Rules Reimagined: A Safe Composition Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Delta s and the", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These tools consider rules as black-boxes, and compose multiple rules by giving the output of a given rewriting as input to the next one. It is up to the developer to identify the right order (if it exists) among all the different rules. In this paper, we define a formal model compatible with the black-box assumption that reifies the modifications (Delta s) made by each rule. Leveraging these Delta s, we propose a way to safely compose multiple rules when applied to the same program by (i) ensuring the isolated application of the different rules and (ii) yield unexpected behaviors that were silently ignored before. We assess this approach by applying rewriting rules used to fix anti-patterns existing in Android applications to external pieces of software available on GitHub.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111047", "output": "Adaptive Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Hybrid Sampling Strategy and Adaptive Strength for Multi-Objective Optimization Problems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In the algorithm, a clustering approach is employed to learn the Pareto optimal set's manifold structure adaptively, in accordance with the regularity property of MOPs, along the evolution. An advanced sampling strategy is developed for the generation of promising offspring from the learned structure. To generate trial solution, each non-dominated solution at present generation is Gaussian-perturbed using the variance-covariance matrix within its cluster. The other new features include 1) an adaptive hybridization of the developed sampling strategy with a differential evolution (DE) operator which aims to combine local and global information; 2) a reusing scheme which is to reduce the computational cost on modeling (clustering); and 3) an adaptive strength Pareto based approach which is to adaptively determine the contribution of the developed sampling strategy and the DE operator for balancing exploration and exploitation. The developed algorithm was empirically compared with four well-known MOEAs on a number of test instances with complex Pareto optimal set structure and complicated Pareto fronts. Experimental results suggest that it outperforms the compared algorithms on these test instances in terms of two commonly-used measure metrics. The effectiveness of the developed sampling strategy, the reusing scheme, the hybrid strategy, and the adaptive strategy was also empirically validated.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "1111048", "output": "\"Bayesian Inference of System Availability in the Presence of Reboot Delay and Standby Switching Failures with Generalized Repair Distributions\"\n\nor \n\n\"Availability Analysis of a Single-Component System with Reboot Delay and Standby Switching Failures: A Bayesian Perspective\"\n\nor \n\n\"Bayesian Modeling of System", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The system is studied under the assumption that the time-to-failure and the time-to-repair are assumed to follow an exponential and a general distribution. The reboot time is assumed to be exponentially distributed with parameter \u03b2. There is always the failure possibility c during the switching process from standby-component state to the active-component state. To implement the simulation inference for the system availability, two repair-time distributions, namely, the lognormal and Erlang distributions characterized by their shape parameters are considered. Finally, all simulation results are displayed by appropriate tables and curves to analyze the performance of the statistical inference procedures.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111049", "output": "Hybrid Stochastic-Deterministic Minibatch Proximal Gradient Algorithms for Large-Scale Strongly Convex Problems with Linear Prediction Structure", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Accordingly, we propose a hybrid stochastic-deterministic minibatch proximal gradient (\n<small>HSDMPG</small>\n) algorithm for strongly convex problems with linear prediction structure, e.g., least squares and logistic/softmax regression. \n<small>HSDMPG</small>\n enjoys improved computational complexity that is data-size-independent for large-scale problems. It iteratively samples an evolving minibatch of individual losses to estimate the original problem, and can efficiently minimize the sampled subproblems. For strongly convex loss of \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n components, \n<small>HSDMPG</small>\n attains an \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-optimization-error within \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O} \\left(\\kappa \\log ^{\\zeta +1}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon }\\right)\\frac{1}{\\epsilon }\\bigwedge n\\log ^{\\zeta }\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon }\\right)\\right)$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n stochastic gradient evaluations, where \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\kappa$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n is condition number, \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\zeta =1$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n for quadratic loss and \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\zeta =2$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n for generic loss. For large-scale problems, our complexity outperforms those of SVRG-type algorithms with/without dependence on data size. Particularly, when \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon =\\mathcal {O}(1/\\sqrt{n})$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n which matches the intrinsic excess error of a learning model and is sufficient for generalization, our complexity for quadratic and generic losses is respectively \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O} (n^{0.5}\\log ^{2}(n))$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n and \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O} (n^{0.5}\\log ^{3}(n))$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n, which for the first time achieves optimal generalization in less than a single pass over data. Besides, we extend \n<small>HSDMPG</small>\n to online strongly convex problems and prove its higher efficiency over the prior algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate the computational advantages of \n<small>HSDMPG</small>\n.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "1111050", "output": "Stabilization and Optimal Control for Infinite Horizon Discrete-Time Mean-Field Systems: A Coupled Algebraic Riccati Equation Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, similarly to the traditional Internet, IoT is facing many security issues, part of which caused by the presence of an astounding number of vulnerable devices. Researchers have been struggling to improve the security of IoT in many different ways, one of which concerning the employment of intrusion detection systems (IDS) in IoT environments. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of an intrusion detection technique, named PCkAD, in IoT environments. The technique exploits the spatial distribution information of payload data to identify malicious contents. PCkAD was evaluated on two datasets, containing traffic related to sensors and actuators. The experimental results show that PCkAD can be effectively employed to increase the security of IoT environments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "1111054", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title.

The robustness of a network needs to account for graceful performance degradation with multiple failures in the network. The traditional delay metric of the diameter of the network is insufficient in this regards to represent the message passing delay in the presence of faults. This paper explores the d-wide diameter of a class of regular extended line digraphs which bound the delays despite faults. By studying the container of the network's underlying graph, a measure of the distance between nodes through multiple node disjoint paths is obtained. This study shows that the class of networks designed by extended line digraphs has very tight upper bounds on the d-wide diameter and is just one more than the normal diameter. Thus despite d-1 node failures the worst case delay is just one more than that of the original network. This tight bound has very powerful uses in areas of enabling load balancing and bounded delays despite multiple network faults.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111057", "output": "\"Novel Collaborative Hashing Techniques for Low-Bit Code Optimization in Real-World Applications\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Primary-ambient extraction (PAE) is one of the key approaches to facilitate flexible and optimal rendering in spatial audio reproduction. Existing approaches, such as principal component analysis and time-frequency masking, often suffer from severe extraction error. This problem is more evident when the sound scene contains a relatively strong ambient component, which is frequently encountered in digital media. In this Letter, we propose a novel PAE approach by estimating the ambient phase with a sparsity constraint (APES). This approach exploits the equal magnitude of the uncorrelated ambient components in the two channels of a stereo signal and reformulates the PAE problem as an ambient phase estimation problem, which is then solved using the criterion that the primary component is sparse. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing approaches, especially when the ambient component is relatively strong.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111063", "output": "\"Decades of Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering: A Systematic Mapping Study of Trends, Evolution, and Future Directions\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Goal modeling has been adapted and applied to many sub-topics within requirements engineering (RE) and beyond, such as agent orientation, aspect orientation, business intelligence, model-driven development, and security. Despite extensive efforts in this field, the RE community lacks a recent, general systematic literature review of the area. In this work, we present a systematic mapping study, covering the 246 top-cited GORE-related conference and journal papers, according to Scopus. Our literature map addresses several research questions: we classify the types of papers (e.g., proposals, formalizations, meta-studies), look at the presence of evaluation, the topics covered (e.g., security, agents, scenarios), frameworks used, venues, citations, author networks, and overall publication numbers. For most questions, we evaluate trends over time. Our findings show a proliferation of papers with new ideas and few citations, with a small number of authors and papers dominating citations; however, there is a slight rise in papers which build upon past work (implementations, integrations, and extensions). We see a rise in papers concerning adaptation/variability/evolution and a slight rise in case studies. Overall, interest in GORE has increased. We use our analysis results to make recommendations concerning future GORE research and make our data publicly available.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "1111064", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generated the following title:\n\n\"Reliability-Enhanced Cooperative Information Sharing in Multiagent Systems: A Subjective Logic Approach for Intelligent Transportation Systems\"\n\nUsing the feature <similarpairs>, I found that my previous works on cooperative information sharing and multiagent systems had similar title structures, incorporating relevant", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Relying on wrong information, however, can have severe consequences. While classical approaches only consider measurement uncertainty, reliability information on the incoming data can be useful for decision making. In this work, a subjective logic based mechanism is proposed that amends reliability information to the data shared among the MAS. If multiple agents report the same event, their information is fused. In order to maintain high reliability, the mechanism detects and isolates misbehaving agents. Therefore, an attacker model is specified that includes faulty as well as malicious agents. The mechanism is applied to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and it is shown in simulation that the approach scales well with the size of the MAS and that it is able to efficiently detected and isolated misbehaving agents.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111065", "output": "\"Enriching IoT Ecosystems: Human-Centered Approaches for Enhanced User Experience and System Performance\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Enriching IoT Ecosystems\", \"Human-Centered IoT Applications\"],\n[\"Human-Centered IoT\", \"Enhancing IoT User Experience\"],\n[\"IoT Ecosystems\", \"Human", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The \"adaptive\" is reflected in its selection algorithm that can retrieve best-suited questions for student based on his/her estimated proficiency at each test step. Although there are many sophisticated selection algorithms for improving CAT's effectiveness, they are restricted and perturbed by the accuracy of current proficiency estimate, thus lacking robustness. To this end, we investigate a general method to enhance the robustness of existing algorithms by leveraging student's \"multi-facet\" nature during tests. Specifically, we present a generic optimization criterion Robust Adaptive Testing (RAT) for proficiency estimation via fusing multiple estimates at each step, which maintains a multi-facet description of student's potential proficiency. We further provide theoretical analyses of such estimator's desirable statistical properties: asymptotic unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency. Extensive experiments on perturbed synthetic data and three real-world datasets show that selection algorithms in our RAT framework are robust and yield substantial improvements.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "1111067", "output": "\"HARQ in Multi-Hop Networks: Analytical Modeling and Diversity Order Improvement\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

First, we use a Markov chain to model the multi-hop system with truncated HARQ type-I (HARQ-I) and derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability and throughput; we also obtain lower and upper bounds on the energy efficiency of the system. Then, we extend the analysis to cover HARQ with packet combining where we provide a general formulation of the outage probability; in special cases, closed-form expressions for outage probability and throughput are obtained. Finally, for a multi-hop system with opportunistic routing, we present recursive formulas to obtain outage probability and throughput. The expressions we derived allow us to draw conclusions about the outage diversity of different multi-hop protocols. In particular, we show that the diversity order is improved for opportunistic multi-hop system and is linearly increasing with the number of allowed transmissions for each packet. Numerical results illustrate how the analytical expression can be used to compare various multi-hop HARQ transmission strategies.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "1111068", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Multilevel Schur Low Rank Preconditioner for Indefinite Linear Systems\",\n\"Block Preconditioning Strategies for Nonsymmetric Systems\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- Use of \"nonsymmetric\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper combines ideas from the multilevel Schur low rank preconditioner developed by Y. Xi, R. Li, and Y. Saad [SIAM J. Matrix Anal., 37 (2016), pp. 235-259] with classic block preconditioning strategies in order to handle this case. The method to be described generates a tree structure T that represents a hierarchical decomposition of the original matrix. This decomposition gives rise to a block structured matrix at each level of T. An approximate inverse of the original matrix based on its block LU factorization is computed at each level via a low rank property that characterizes the difference between the inverses of the Schur complement and another block of the reordered matrix. The low rank correction matrix is computed by several steps of the Arnoldi process. Numerical results illustrate the robustness of the proposed preconditioner with respect to indefiniteness for a few discretized partial differential equations and publicly available test problems.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111069", "output": "\"Frame Rate Up-Conversion via Prediction-Based Recursive Search: A Novel Approach for Enhanced Motion Continuity and Image Quality\"\n\nor\n\n\"Prediction-Based Recursive Search for Frame Rate Up-Conversion: A Comparative Study on Motion Continuity and Image Quality Enhancement\"\n\nor\n\n\"Recursive Search for Frame Rate Up-Conversion: A Texture", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The proposed algorithm, called the prediction based recursive search (PBRS), can provide a better prediction for frame interpolation. The texture based block partitioning can effectively represent the detailed motions around the object boundaries and thus, the proposed PBRS can find more accurate motions. Thus, the notable image quality improvement can be obtained using PBRS. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the average PSNR and SSIM of the interpolated frames by up to 2.42 dB and 0.0252, respectively, with relatively low computational complexity compared to the existing algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111070", "output": "Competitive Matching Algorithms for Dynamic Marketplaces with Uncertain Departure Times", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Agents can only be matched while they are present in the marketplace. Each pair of agents can yield a different match value, and the planneru0027s goal is to maximize the total value over a finite time horizon. We study matching algorithms that perform well over any sequence of arrivals when there is no a priori information about the match values or arrival times. Our main contribution is a 1/4-competitive algorithm. The algorithm randomly selects a subset of agents who will wait until right before their departure to get matched, and maintains a maximum-weight matching with respect to the other agents. The primal-dual analysis of the algorithm hinges on a careful comparison between the initial dual value associated with an agent when it first arrives, and the final value after d time steps. It is also shown that no algorithm is 1/2-competitive. We extend the model to the case in which departure times are drawn i.i.d from a distribution with non-decreasing hazard rate, and establish a 1/8-competitive algorithm in this setting. Finally we show on real-world data that a modified version of our algorithm performs well in practice.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.32}, {"id": "1111071", "output": "Context-aware Vehicle Itineraries: A Complex Event Processing Approach for Occupancy Detection and Frequent Patterns Analysis", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As a result, an on-board context-aware application that processes the usual itineraries of the Ego Vehicle as part of the vehicular context has been implemented. Particularly, the system follows a Complex Event Processing (CEP) approach, and it is able to detect the vehicular occupancy along with the meaningful points of the frequent itineraries whereby a density-based-cluster algorithm. Test results from simulations and real environments show the accuracy of the system when it comes to detect different types of itineraries.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "1111072", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\nOptimizing Cooperative Distribution in Pervasive Networks through Relaxation of NP-Complete Strategies for Fog Computing and Machine-to-Machine Communications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Among the many applications, also video streaming can be provided with a cooperative and peer-to-peer approach. Cooperative distribution requires building a distribution overlay on top of the physical topology (the underlay). This work proposes an optimized, cross-layer approach to build this overlay minimizing the impact on the underlay. We design an optimal strategy, which is proven to be NP-complete, and thus not solvable with a distributed, lightweight protocol. The optimal strategy is relaxed exploiting the knowledge on the betweenness centrality of the nodes in the underlay topology, obtaining two easily implementable solutions applicable to any link-state protocol for distributed wireless mesh networks. The additional introduction of heuristic improvements further optimizes the performance in real network scenarios. Extensive simulation results support the theoretical findings using three different network topologies. They show that the relaxed implementations are reasonably close to the optimal solution, and provide vast gains compared to the traditional overlay topologies that peer-to-peer applications build.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.8}, {"id": "1111073", "output": "Optimization of Investor Portfolio Selection via Enhanced Efficient Frontier Analysis and Risk Assessment", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It is able to reinforce the informative channels as well as to suppress the useless channels. Recently, different channel attention modules have been proposed and implemented in various ways. Generally speaking, they are mainly based on convolution and pooling operations. In this paper, we propose Gaussian process embedded channel attention (GPCA) module and further interpret the channel attention schemes in a probabilistic way. The GPCA module intends to model the correlations among the channels, which are assumed to be captured by beta distributed variables. As the beta distribution cannot be integrated into the end-to-end training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a mathematically tractable solution, we utilize an approximation of the beta distribution to solve this problem. To specify, we adapt a Sigmoid-Gaussian approximation, in which the Gaussian distributed variables are transferred into the interval [0,1]. The Gaussian process is then utilized to model the correlations among different channels. In this case, a mathematically tractable solution is derived. The GPCA module can be efficiently implemented and integrated into the end-to-end training of the CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed GPCA module.

Such systems use specialized engines to find optimal means of transport between two geospatial endpoints to provide recommendations to citizens for short routes across the city. At the same time, alternative means of transportation, such as bike sharing systems, have enjoyed tremendous success since they offer a green and facile solution for daily commuters and tourists. However, one major challenge of the bike sharing systems is that the distribution of bikes among the stations can be quite uneven during rush hours or due to topography. This often results in shortage of bikes and increasing numbers of disappointed users. Existing works in the literature are limited since they only focus on predicting the demand or apply a-posteriori methods for balancing the load of stations. Furthermore, none of these works consider the benefit of these systems in concert. In this work, we present \"MOToR\" (MultimOdal Trip Rebalancing), a system that builds upon the OpenTripPlanner framework to incorporate dynamic transit schedule data while balancing the availability of bikes among the bike stations. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach is practical, efficient and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for route planning.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.88}, {"id": "1111076", "output": "Novel H\u221e State Estimation Scheme for Fuzzy Semi-Markov Jump Systems with Indirectly Accessible Mode Information and Nonideal Data Transmission", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We demonstrate how the design of the cost function promotes a model with either a continuous change in dynamics over time, or causes discontinuous changes in model coefficients occurring at a finite (sparse) set of time instances. We further discuss the introduction of priors on the model parameters for situations where excitation is insufficient for identification. The identification problems are cast as convex optimization problems and are applicable to, e.g., ARX models and state-space models with time-varying parameters. We illustrate usage of the methods in simulations of jump-linear systems, a nonlinear robot arm with non-smooth friction and stiff contacts as well as in model-based, trajectory centric reinforcement learning on a smooth nonlinear system.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111078", "output": "Energy Efficient Resource Allocation in Uplink Hybrid Systems with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access and Minimum Rate Requirements for Quality of Service", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Gathering contextual information is a very expensive activity in terms of mobile device resource consumption, so limiting this consumption is essential for user satisfaction. The architectural style applied to the MCS platform largely affects the consumption of these resources. A server-centric MCS is more efficient when there are many entities interested on the gathered information, whilst a mobile-centric architecture has lower consumption when real-time information is required. In this paper, we propose a platform combining both architectural styles. This allows us to reduce the resource consumption of mobile devices, since it is easier to take advantage of the benefits of each style, and to better facilitate user aggregation, being able to group users both at the server and at the client-side depending on the freshness of the required information and the sensing task to be assigned. Finally, we have evaluated this platform for two different case studies, obtaining very promising results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111081", "output": "Probabilistic Model Checking for Continuous-Time Markov Chains Induced from Stochastic Reaction Networks via Gaussian Process Approximation and Efficient Scalable Algorithms", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Classical numerical algorithms for CSL model checking based on uniformisation are limited to finite CTMCs and suffer from exponential growth of the state space with respect to the number of species. However, approximate techniques such as mean-field approximations and simulations combined with statistical inference are more scalable but can be time-consuming and do not support the full expressiveness of CSL. In this article, we employ a continuous-space approximation of the CTMC in terms of a Gaussian process based on the Central Limit Approximation, also known as the Linear Noise Approximation, whose solution requires solving a number of differential equations that is quadratic in the number of species and independent of the population size. We then develop efficient and scalable approximate model checking algorithms on the resulting Gaussian process, where we restrict the target regions for probabilistic reachability to convex polytopes. This allows us to derive an abstraction in terms of a time-inhomogeneous discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC), whose dimension is independent of the number of species, on which model checking is performed. Using results from probability theory, we prove the convergence in distribution of our algorithms to the corresponding measures on the original CTMC. We implement the techniques and, on a set of examples, demonstrate that they allow us to overcome the state space explosion problem, while still correctly characterizing the stochastic behaviour of the system. Our methods can be used for formal analysis of a wide range of distributed stochastic systems, including biochemical systems, sensor networks, and population protocols.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "1111082", "output": "Combined Cache for Endurance (CCE): A Novel Approach to Enhancing the Durability of High Density Multilevel Non-Volatile Memories in Embedded Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These memories are attractive as they can reduce the static power consumption dramatically and a single memory can be potentially used avoiding having both flash and SRAM or DRAM in a system. However, a common drawback of the new multilevel non volatile memories is that they support a limited number of write operations and thus its endurance needs to be improved to make them a viable alternative for the main memory of embedded systems. The proposed CCE relies on the fact that most writes are concentrated on a few addresses. Therefore, a small SRAM cache can be used to store positions that are frequently written. However, this would not preserve the non volatile nature of the memory. To do so, in the proposed CCE, the cache cell has an SRAM part and a non volatile part. At power up the contents of the non volatile part are copied to the SRAM and the other way around at power down. As many embedded systems execute predictable workloads, this cache is statically set to cover the most frequently written addresses. The evaluation shows that CCE can increase the endurance of the memory by several orders of magnitude. At the same time the overheads required to implement the cache are small relative to the main memory. Therefore, CCE can be an interesting option to improve the endurance of next generation high density multilevel non volatile memories.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "1111083", "output": "\"Attention-Guided Feature Fusion for Enhanced Low-Light Image Dehazing\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this article, we propose an attention-based feature fusion network (AFF-Dehazing) for low-light image dehazing. Our method decomposes the low-light image dehazing into two task-independent streams containing four modules: image dehazing module, low-light feature extractor module, feature fusion module, and image restoration module.

However, the context in which the learning occurs is important for educational innovations to impact student learning. In particular, for student-facing learning analytics systems like feedback tools to work effectively, they have to be integrated with pedagogical approaches and the learning design. This paper proposes a conceptual model to strike a balance between the concepts of generalizable scalable support and contextualized specific support by clarifying key elements that help to contextualize student-facing learning analytics tools. We demonstrate an implementation of the model using a writing analytics example, where the features, feedback and learning activities around the automated writing feedback tool are tuned for the pedagogical context and the assessment regime in hand, by co-designing them with the subject experts. The model can be employed for learning analytics to move from generalized support to meaningful contextualized support for enhancing learning.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "1111086", "output": "\"Comparative Analysis of Landmark-Based and Shape-Based Methods for Population Motion Prediction in Focused Ultrasound Surgery and Conformal Radiation Therapies for Livers\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Population motion models have shown their ability to predict unobservable motion from tracking results. These models require establishment of inter-subject correspondences, which is non-trivial. In this study we compare the use of a landmark-based method with a shape-based approach for this task. The influence of the inter-subject correspondences on the motion model predictions was assessed in leave-one-subject-out tests. For simulated 3D (2D) tracking results, the landmark-based motion models reduced the right liver lobe 95% motion from 12.4 (11.9) mm to 4.6 (4.5) mm on average. The shape-based models improved this further to 3.7 (3.8) mm and reduced the mean error by 13% (9%). While the landmarks were only defined for the right liver lobe, the shape-based approach enabled the motion prediction of the whole liver with a 95% error of less than 4.8 mm.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "1111087", "output": "\"Probabilistic Multi-Robot Policy Refining for Efficient Task Allocation and Planning in Uncertain Environments\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Task allocation is performed simultaneously with planning, which provides more detailed information about individual robot behaviour, but also exploits independence between tasks to do so efficiently. We use Markov decision processes to model robot behaviour and linear temporal logic to specify tasks and safety constraints. Building upon techniques and tools from formal verification, we show how to generate a sequence of multi-robot policies, iteratively refining them to reallocate tasks if individual robots fail, and providing probabilistic guarantees on the performance (and safe operation) of the team of robots under the resulting policy. We implement our approach and evaluate it on a benchmark multi-robot example.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "1111088", "output": "\"Uncertainty-Aware Assembly Pathway Prediction: A Statistical-Ensemble Approach to Capturing Conformational Changes and Binding Interfaces in Viral Capsid Assembly\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This assumption does not take into account the conformational changes of the constituent proteins as well as minor changes to the binding interfaces that continue throughout the assembly process until stabilization. This article presents a statistical-ensemble-based approach that samples the configurational space for each monomer with the relative local orientation between monomers, to capture the uncertainties in binding and conformations. Further, instead of using larger capsomers (trimers, pentamers) as building blocks, we allow all possible subassemblies to bind in all possible combinations. We represent the resulting assembly graph in two different ways: First, we use the Wilcoxon signed-rank measure to compare the distributions of binding free energy computed on the sampled conformations to predict likely pathways. Second, we represent chemical equilibrium aspects of the transitions as a Bayesian Factor graph where both associations and dissociations are modeled based on concentrations and the binding free energies. We applied these protocols on the feline panleukopenia virus and the Nudaurelia capensis virus. Results from these experiments showed a significant departure from those that one would obtain if only the static configurations of the proteins were considered. Hence, we establish the importance of an uncertainty-aware protocol for pathway analysis, and we provide a statistical framework as an important first step toward assembly pathway prediction with high statistical confidence.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.65}, {"id": "1111089", "output": "\"Enriching Computational Thinking through Adaptive Scaffolding in an Open-Ended Simulation and Modeling Environment\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we develop a learner modeling and adaptive scaffolding framework for Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling (CTSiM)--an open ended learning environment that supports synergistic learning of science and Computational Thinking (CT) for middle school students. In CTSiM, students have the freedom to choose and coordinate use of the different tools provided in the environment, as they build and test their models. However, the open-ended nature of the environment makes it hard to interpret the intent of students' actions, and to provide useful feedback and hints that improves student understanding and helps them achieve their learning goals. To address this challenge, we define an extended learner modeling scheme that uses (1) a hierarchical task model for the CTSiM environment, (2) a set of strategies that support effective learning and model building, and (3) effectiveness and coherence measures that help us evaluate student's proficiency in the different tasks and strategies. We use this scheme to dynamically scaffold learners when they are deficient in performing their tasks, or they demonstrate suboptimal use of strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a classroom study where one group of 6th grade students received scaffolding and the other did not. We found that students who received scaffolding built more accurate models, used modeling strategies effectively, adopted more useful modeling behaviors, showed a better understanding of important science and CT concepts, and transferred their modeling skills better to new scenarios.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "1111090", "output": "\"Game-Theoretic Framework for Data De-identification: A Novel Approach to Optimal Data Sharing in Healthcare\"\n\nor \n\"De-identification in Healthcare: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Informed Data Sharing\"\n\nor \n\"Game-Theoretic Optimization of Data Sharing in Healthcare: A De-identification Framework\"\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Each player has full information about the other player's location, players take turns, and the robber is captured when the cop arrives at the same point as the robber. In visibility graphs we show the cop can always win because visibility graphs are dismantlable, which is interesting as one of the few results relating visibility graphs to other known graph classes. We extend this to show that the cop wins games in which players move along straight line segments inside any polygon and, more generally, inside any simply connected planar region with a reasonable boundary. Essentially, our problem is a type of pursuit\u2013evasion using the link metric rather than the Euclidean metric, and our result provides an interesting class of infinite cop-win graphs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111092", "output": "Energy Consumption of Android Apps: An Empirical Study of the Influence of Code Smells on Power Efficiency", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The demand for green software design is steadily growing higher especially in the context of mobile devices, where the computation is often limited by battery life. Previous studies found how wrong programming solutions have a strong impact on the energy consumption. Objective. Despite the efforts spent so far, only a little knowledge on the influence of code smells, i.e.,symptoms of poor design or implementation choices, on the energy consumption of mobile applications is available. Method. To provide a wider overview on the relationship between smells and energy efficiency, in this paper we conducted a large-scale empirical study on the influence of 9 Android-specific code smells on the energy consumption of 60 Android apps. In particular, we focus our attention on the design flaws that are theoretically supposed to be related to non-functional attributes of source code, such as performance and energy consumption. Results. The results of the study highlight that methods affected by four code smell types, i.e.,Internal Setter, Leaking Thread, Member Ignoring Method, and Slow Loop, consume up to 87 times more than methods affected by other code smells. Moreover, we found that refactoring these code smells reduces energy consumption in all of the situations. Conclusions. Based on our findings, we argue that more research aimed at designing automatic refactoring approaches and tools for mobile apps is needed.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "1111093", "output": "\"Securing Electronic Money via One-Time Programs and Shamir's Secret Sharing: A Novel Approach to Prevent Double-Spending and Identify Double-Spenders\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The OTP uses a Garbled Circuit (GC), a circuit which does not leak the information except the execution result, as a building block. However, we need to use a special hardware called One-time Memory (OTM) to permit access to only one of two labels necessary for the execution of the GC. When the OTM does not exist or it is expensive, the realistic realization of the OTP is difficult. Furthermore, the OTM needs to be transported to a program executor and needs the production cost. Instead of using OTMs, we propose a way to distribute inputs to multiple cloud storages by using Shamir's secret sharing. In addition, we apply the proposed method to electronic money. Existing electronic money schemes do not prevent double-spending itself, but detect it and identify the double-spender. Therefore, one can double-spend the same electronic money illegally in a short time. Then we can detect the double-spending and identify the double-spender after delivering a product, but the double-spender can abscond with it. To tackle such a problem, we construct an electronic money scheme which prevents double-spending itself based on the OTP that generates a digital signature during a transaction. Combining the proposed electronic money scheme with an existing electronic money scheme, we can also construct another electronic money scheme which can detect double-spending even if the security of the OTP is broken.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "1111094", "output": "\"Designing Social Capital in Games: The Role of Interdependence and Toxicity in Shaping Player Well-being\"\n\nor\n\n\"Social Capital in Online Gaming Communities: A Study of Interdependence, Toxicity, and Player Well-being\"\n\nor\n\n\"The Impact of Interdependence and Toxicity on Social Capital in Games: Imp", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We investigate how in-game friendships develop, and how they affect well-being. We deployed an online survey (N= 234) measuring the properties of games and social capital that participants experience within their gaming community, alongside indicators of the social aspects of their psychological wellbeing (loneliness, need satisfaction of relatedness). First, our findings highlight two strong predictors of in-game social capital: interdependence and toxicity, whereas cooperation appears to be less crucial than common wisdom suggests. Second, we demonstrate how in-game social capital is associated with reduced feelings of loneliness and increased satisfaction of relatedness. Our findings suggest that social capital in games is strongly and positively related to players' psychological well-being. The present study informs both the design of social games as well as our theoretical understanding of in-game relationships.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111095", "output": "Runtime Monitoring through Power Consumption Analysis for Non-Intrusive Program Tracing\nImproving Runtime Monitoring through Spectral Analysis and Control Flow Graph Constraints", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This poses a significant challenge, since monitoring tools can break extra-functional requirements such as timing constraints. Non-intrusive program tracing through side-channel analysis techniques have recently appeared in the literature and constitute a promising approach. Existing techniques, however, exhibit important limitations. In this paper, we present a novel technique for non-intrusive program tracing from power consumption, based on a signals and system analysis approach: we view the power consumption signal as the output of a system with the power consumption of training samples as input. Using spectral analysis, we compute the impulse response to identify the system; the intuition is that for the correct training sample, the system will appear close to a system that outputs a shifted copy of the input signal, for which the impulse response is an impulse at the position corresponding to the shift. We also use the Control Flow Graph from the source code to constrain the classifier to valid sequences only, leading to substantial performance improvements over previous works. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our technique and show its applicability to runtime monitoring. The experiments include tracing programs that execute randomly generated sequences of functions as well as tracing a real application developed with SCADE. The experimental evaluation also includes a case-study as evidence of the usability of our technique to detect anomalous execution through runtime monitoring.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "1111096", "output": "\"Surveying the Landscape of Social Network Analysis: A Review of Models for Topic Analysis and Information Diffusion\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It is also widely known and used to improve computation times, reduce computation requirements, and to decrease the impact of the curse of dimensionality and enhancing the generalization rates of classifiers. In data streams, classifiers shall benefit from all the items above, but more importantly, from the fact that the relevant subset of features may drift over time. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic feature selection method for data streams called Adaptive Boosting for Feature Selection (ABFS). ABFS chains decision stumps and drift detectors, and as a result, identifies which features are relevant to the learning task as the stream progresses with reasonable success. In addition to our proposed algorithm, we bring feature selection-specific metrics from batch learning to streaming scenarios. Next, we evaluate ABFS according to these metrics in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. As a result, ABFS improves the classification rates of different types of learners and eventually enhances computational resources usage.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "1111099", "output": "Real-Time Bidirectional Texture Function and Image-Based Lighting Rendering of the Takigi Noh: A Reflectance Analysis Approach\n\n<similarpairs>\nReal-Time Bidirectional Texture Function and Image-Based Lighting Rendering of Traditional Theatrical Costumes\nReal-Time Rendering of Historical Theatrical Costumes using Bidirectional Texture Function and Image", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Due to missing, informal or outdated design documentation, developers often have to rely on the source code to identify design problems. Therefore, developers have to analyze different symptoms that manifest in several code elements, which may quickly turn into a complex task. Although researchers have been investigating techniques to help developers in identifying design problems, there is little knowledge on how developers actually proceed to identify design problems. In order to tackle this problem, we conducted a multi-trial industrial experiment with professionals from 5 software companies to build a grounded theory. The resulting theory offers explanations on how developers identify design problems in practice. For instance, it reveals the characteristics of symptoms that developers consider helpful. Moreover, developers often combine different types of symptoms to identify a single design problem. This knowledge serves as a basis to further understand the phenomena and advance towards more effective identification techniques.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111102", "output": "\"Automating Shading in 2D Cartoon and Manga Production: Bridging the Gap between Geometry and Artistic Creativity\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Such an analysis can be used to explore spatial and temporal patterns in different domains, i.e., spatial and temporal information of subscribers in Internet of Things networks. Most spatial and temporal analysis techniques are based on conventional quantitative and traditional data mining approaches, such as the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-means algorithm. Clustering approaches based on artificial neural networks can be more efficient since they can reveal nonlinear patterns. Hence, in this work, we tailor an AI-based spatiotemporal unsupervised model such that the underlying pattern structure of a mobile phone network can be revealed, relative similarity among interactions extracted, and the associated patterns analyzed. The proposed approach is based on an optimized self-organizing feature map. It deals with high-dimensionality concerns and preserves inherent data structures. By identifying the spatial and temporal associations, decision makers can explore dominant interactions that can be used for resource optimization in network planning, content distribution, and urban planning.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111105", "output": "\"Distributed Sparse Representation via Multi-Layer Dictionary Learning\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Traditional dictionary learning is limited to relatively small-scale problems, because high-dimensional dense dictionaries can be costly to manipulate, both at the learning stage and when used for tasks such as sparse coding. In this paper, inspired by usual fast transforms, we consider a multi-layer sparse dictionary structure allowing cheaper manipulation, and propose a learning algorithm imposing this structure. The approach is demonstrated experimentally with a factorization of the Hadamard matrix and on image denoising.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.25}, {"id": "1111106", "output": "\"Compressive Random Access for Massive Machine-Type Communications: A Comprehensive Scheme for Synchronized Estimation and Detection\"\n\nor\n\n\"Bi-Directional IORLS Estimation for Low-Latency Machine-Type Communications: A Grant-Free Random Access Scheme\"\n\nor\n\n\"Joint Sparse Estimation and Detection for Low-Latency", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The scheme presented in here is comprehensive in a sense that, synchronization, channel estimation, and users identification & data detection (multi-user detection) are performed all in a single shot. The scheme employs compressive sensing by exploiting two sparse phenomena: sparsity in users activity and sparsity in multi-path channel. Furthermore, the scheme is designed in such a way that channel estimation and multi-user detection have a bi-directional mutual relationship, enabling one to reinforce the other for accurate detection and estimation. Moreover, the iterative order recursive least square (IORLS) estimation algorithm is modified & employed in such a way that it exploits the joint structure in multi-path channel and multi-user signal sparsity.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111107", "output": "Decidability of Turing-Decidable Predicates on Labeled Networks with Alternating Turing Machines: A Hierarchy of Local Algorithms", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This holds even if nodes are running non-deterministic Turing machines (NTM). In contrast, we show that every Turing-decidable predicate on labeled networks can be decided locally if nodes are running alternating Turing machines (ATM). More specifically, we show that, for every such predicate, there is a local algorithm for ATMs, with at most two alternations, that decides whether the actual labeled network satisfies that predicate. To this aim, we define a hierarchy of classes of decision tasks, where the lowest level contains tasks solvable with TMs, the first level those solvable with NTMs, and the level k>1 contains those tasks solvable with ATMs with k\u22121 alternations. We characterize the entire hierarchy, and show that it collapses in the second level.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "1111108", "output": "\"Structural Implications of Even and Odd Pairs in Graphs: A Polyhedral Characterization\"\n\nor\n\n\"Even and Odd Pairs in Graphs: Implications for the Stable Set Polytope\"\n\nor\n\n\"The Role of Even and Odd Pairs in Perfect and Arbitrary Graphs: A Stable Set", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Regrettably, the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. By estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways, computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap between data and biological functionality. These models currently portray the average behavior of cell populations however, masking the inherent heterogeneity that is part and parcel of tumorigenesis as much as drug resistance. To remove this limitation, we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate single-cell transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes. We show that the integration of single-cell RNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer patients into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of a cancer cell population: significantly 1) reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites.

The \u03bc-calculus and its relatives are among the most expressive logics of this type. However, popular fixpoint logics tend to trade expressivity for simplicity and readability and in fact often live within the single variable fragment of the \u03bc-calculus. The family of such flat fixpoint logics includes, e.g., Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), Computation Tree Logic (CTL), and the logic of common knowledge. Extending this notion to the generic semantic framework of coalgebraic logic enables covering a wide range of logics beyond the standard \u03bc-calculus including, e.g., flat fragments of the graded \u03bc-calculus and the alternating-time \u03bc-calculus (such as alternating-time temporal logic), as well as probabilistic and monotone fixpoint logics. We give a generic proof of completeness of the Kozen-Park axiomatization for such flat coalgebraic fixpoint logics.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111112", "output": "\"Relaxing Completeness Guarantees in Formal Methods: A Scalable Approach with EvoAlloy\"\n\nor\n\n\"Scalable Soundness and Completeness in Formal Verification: A Genetic Algorithm Extension to Alloy\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

With these techniques we can perform a multitude of tasks to check system dependability. Despite the existence of many automated tools including ones considered lightweight, they still lack a strong adoption in practice. At the crux of this problem, is scalability and applicability to large real world applications. In this paper we show how to relax the completeness guarantee without much loss, since soundness is maintained. We have extended a popular lightweight analysis, Alloy, with a genetic algorithm. Our new tool, EvoAlloy, works at the level of finite relations generated by Kodkod and evolves the chromosomes based on the failed constraints. In a feasibility study we demonstrate that we can find solutions to a set of specifications beyond the scope where traditional Alloy fails. While small specifications take longer with EvoAlloy, the scalability means we can handle larger specifications. Our future vision is that when specifications are small we can maintain both soundness and completeness, but when this fails, EvoAlloy can switch to its genetic algorithm.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.84}, {"id": "1111113", "output": "Based on the provided abstract and features, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Event-Triggered Fuzzy Control for Networked Nonlinear Continuous-Time Systems: A Novel Auxiliary Random Series Approach\"\n\nUsing the similar abstract-title pairs, I found a match with:\n\"Fuzzy Control for Networked Nonlinear Systems: A Random Series", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

T\u2013S fuzzy model is employed to describe the nonlinear systems. In order to save the bandwidth and energy, we introduce the event-triggered mechanism to reduce the number of data for transmission and computation. Thus, it is necessary to consider the influence of data losses, data disorder, and transmission delay since the transmitted data packets become more important. Consequently, it is very complicated to analyze the performance of such networked system and one of the most difficult part, in the authors\u2019 opinion, is to construct the mathematical model of closed-loop systems. In this paper, we present an auxiliary random series approach to describe the data transmitted in the system, and therefore, the closed-loop systems can be obtained.

Asynchronous membership functions are considered to obtain more relaxed stability conditions.

However, this indirect interaction model can be assumed as inefficient and sensitive when considering communications with neighboring devices. To leverage such weaknesses, nearby peer-to-peer (P2P) communications are now included in mobile devices to enable device-to-device communications over standard wireless technologies (WiFi, Bluetooth). While this capability supports the design of collaborative whiteboards, local multiplayer gaming, multi-screen gaming, offline file transfers and many other applications, mobile apps using P2P are still suffering from app crashes, battery issues, and bad user reviews and ranking in app stores. We believe that this lack of quality can be partly attributed to the lack of tool support for testing P2P mobile apps at large. In this paper, we therefore introduce a test framework that allows developers to implement reproducible testing of nearby P2P apps. Beyond the identification of P2P-related errors, our approach also helps to tune the discovery protocol settings to optimize the deployment of P2P apps.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111116", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Design and Implementation of a Policy-Based Security Framework for SDN/NFV-Enabled IoT Networks\",\n\"Secure AAA Management in SDN/NFV-Enabled IoT Networks using Policy-Based Frameworks\",\n\"Policy-Based Security", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this sense, this paper presents and evaluates a novel policy-based and cyber-situational awareness security framework for continuous and dynamic management of Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) as well as Channel Protection virtual security functions in IoT networks enabled with SDN/NFV. The virtual AAA, including network authenticators, are deployed as VNF (Virtual Network Function) dynamically at the edge, in order to enable scalable device's bootstrapping and managing the access control of IoT devices to the network. In addition, our solution allows distributing dynamically the necessary crypto-keys for IoT Machine to Machine (M2M) communications and deploy virtual Channel-protection proxys as VNFs, with the aim of establishing secure tunnels among IoT devices and services, according to the contextual decisions inferred by the cognitive framework. The solution has been implemented and evaluated, demonstrating its feasibility to manage dynamically AAA and channel protection in SDN/NFV-enabled IoT scenarios.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111117", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Consensus in Distributed Systems\", \"Distributed Localization\", \"Networked Agent Systems\", \"Vision-Based Localization\", \"Adaptive Control for Distributed Systems\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n  - Average word length: ", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Despite these challenges, humanitarian organizations are transitioning towards a strong reliance on the digitization of collected data and digital tools, which improves their effectiveness but also exposes them to computer security threats. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the computer-security challenges of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a large humanitarian organization with over sixteen thousand employees, an international legal personality, which involves privileges and immunities, and over 150 years of experience with armed conflicts and other situations of violence worldwide. To investigate the computer security needs and practices of the ICRC from an operational, technical, legal, and managerial standpoint by considering individual, organizational, and governmental levels, we interviewed 27 field workers, IT staff, lawyers, and managers. Our results provide a first look at the unique security and privacy challenges that humanitarian organizations face when collecting, processing, transferring, and sharing data to enable humanitarian action for a multitude of sensitive activities. These results highlight, among other challenges, the trade offs between operational security and requirements stemming from all stakeholders, the legal barriers for data sharing among jurisdictions; especially, the need to complement privileges and immunities with robust technological safeguards in order to avoid any leakages that might hinder access and potentially compromise the neutrality, impartiality, and independence of humanitarian action.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.17}, {"id": "1111119", "output": "Real-Time Tactile Recognition: A Bounded Online-Sequential Learning Framework for Efficient and Robust Tactile Sequence Analysis", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Tactile data have two salient properties: 1) sequentially real-time and 2) temporally correlated, which essentially calls for a real-time (i.e., online fixed-budget) and recurrent recognition procedure. Based on an efficient and robust spatio-temporal feature representation for tactile sequences, we handle the problem of real-time recurrent tactile recognition by proposing a bounded online-sequential learning framework, and incorporates the strength of batch-regularization bootstrapping, bounded recursive reservoir, and momentum-based estimation. Experimental evaluations show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on test accuracy; and its training performance is superior to most compared models from aspects of average online training error, computational complexity, and storage efficiency.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111120", "output": "\"Unlocking the Perceptual Web: Bringing Computer Vision to the Ubiquitous Web Platform\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Ever since its birth in early 1990's, web capabilities have been increasing in both quantity and quality. However, in spite of all such progress, computer vision is not mainstream on the web yet. The reasons are historical and include lack of sufficient performance of JavaScript, lack of camera support in the standard web APIs, and lack of comprehensive computer-vision libraries. These problems are about to get solved, resulting in the potential of an immersive and perceptual web with transformational effects including in online shopping, education, and entertainment among others. This work aims to enable web with computer vision by bringing hundreds of OpenCV functions to the open web platform. OpenCV is the most popular computer-vision library with a comprehensive set of vision functions and a large developer community. OpenCV is implemented in C++ and up until now, it was not available in the web browsers without the help of unpopular native plugins. This work leverage OpenCV efficiency, completeness, API maturity, and its communitys collective knowledge. It is provided in a format that is easy for JavaScript engines to highly optimize and has an API that is easy for the web programmers to adopt and develop applications. In addition, OpenCV parallel implementations that target SIMD units and multiprocessors can be ported to equivalent web primitives, providing better performance for real-time and interactive use cases.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "1111121", "output": "Transfer Learning for Automatic Hyperparameter Optimization: A Two-Phase Framework for Joint Knowledge Extraction and Adaptive Weight Learning", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Motivated by the tuning behaviors of human experts, it is intuitive to leverage auxiliary knowledge from past HPO tasks to accelerate the current HPO task. In this paper, we propose TransBO, a novel two-phase transfer learning framework for HPO, which can deal with the complementary nature among source tasks and dynamics during knowledge aggregation issues simultaneously. This framework extracts and aggregates source and target knowledge jointly and adaptively, where the weights can be learned in a principled manner. The extensive experiments, including static and dynamic transfer learning settings and neural architecture search, demonstrate the superiority of TransBO over the state-of-the-arts.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.42}, {"id": "1111122", "output": "Robust Depth Enhancement via Multilateral Filtering for View Synthesis Applications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the results with mismatched and occluded pixels would not provide accurately well-matched depth and image information. The mismatched depth-image relations would degrade the performances of view syntheses seriously in modern-day three-dimension video applications. Therefore, how to effectively utilize the image and depth to enhance themselves becomes more and more important. In this paper, we propose an advanced multilateral filter (AMF), which refers spatial, range, depth, and credibility information to achieve their enhancements. The AMF enhancements could sharpen the image, suppress noisy depth, filling depth holes, and sharpen the depth edges simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a superior performance, especially around the object boundary.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.3}, {"id": "1111123", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\nUsing similar abstract-title pairs from my past works: \n\"Policy Verification with Answer Set Programming\"\n\nUsing features shedding light into how I use words and formulate sentences:\n- The title will include the key concept of \"Policy Verification\".\n- It will utilize", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, when the policies are large or defined by multiple authorities, it has proved difficult to analyze errors and vulnerabilities in a manual fashion. Recent advances in the answer set programming (ASP) paradigm have provided a powerful problem-solving formalism that is capable of dealing with policy verification. In this paper, we employ ASP to analyze various properties of XACML policies. To this end, we first propose a structured mechanism to translate a XACML policy into an ASP program. Then, we leverage the features of off-the-shelf ASP solvers to specify and verify a wide range of properties of a XACML policy, including redundancy, conflicts, refinement, completeness, reachability, and usefulness. We present an empirical evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of a policy analysis tool implemented on top of the Clingo ASP solver. The evaluation results show that our approach is computationally more efficient compared with existing approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111124", "output": "Based on the provided similar abstract-title pairs, I generate the following title options:\n\nOption 1: \"A Coalgebraic Framework for Decorated Trace Semantics\"\nOption 2: \"Decorated Trace Semantics for Concurrency Theory: A Coalgebraic Approach\"\nOption 3: \"Generalizing Decorated Tr", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Using the generalized powerset construction, recently introduced by a subset of the authors (Silva et al. 2010 FSTTCS. LIPIcs 8 272-283), we give a coalgebraic presentation of decorated trace semantics. The latter include ready, failure, (complete) trace, possible futures, ready trace and failure trace semantics for labelled transition systems, and ready, (maximal) failure and (maximal) trace semantics for generative probabilistic systems. This yields a uniform notion of minimal representatives for the various decorated trace equivalences, in terms of final Moore automata. As a consequence, proofs of decorated trace equivalence can be given by coinduction, using different types of (Moore-) bisimulation (up-to context).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111125", "output": "Optimizing Relay Amplifying Matrices and Beamforming in Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Networks", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Agents in each generation have access to a public history of noisy aggregate actions in previous generations. Each agent also belongs to an information community, where they share a private noisy signal about the state. We quantify the quality of information aggregation as the asymptotic precision of the publicly learned signal about the state, and study how the interactions between/within information communities affect the quality of learning. By characterizing the precision of aggregate learning for random walks with low volatility, we show the inefficiency of learning from the public history: while for a static state, public history fully reveals the state, a small perturbation in the state from generation to generation significantly degrades the quality of public learning. As for the effect of information-action structure, we show that the inter-community interactions exhibit a double-edged effect: while the inter-community interaction of local influencers and influencees improves the quality of learning for slow dynamics, the intercommunity interaction of global influencers and influencees hampers learning for fast dynamics. As a result, we may observe phase transition in the quality of learning between different information-action structures.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111127", "output": "\"Cooperative Output Regulation of Heterogeneous Multiagent Systems via Event-Based Feedback Control with Continuous-Time Internal Models\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Then, we show that this stabilization can be solved by measurement feedback. It finally allows us to establish a valid event-based protocol, leading to a global practical stability property and meanwhile guaranteeing Zeno-free condition.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "1111128", "output": "Discriminating Recompressed JPEG Images: A Comparative Study of Feature-Based and Deep Learning Approaches for Enhanced Steganalysis", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For some robust steganography methods, in order to enhance stego images\u2019 robustness of resisting JPEG recompression from lossy channel such SNS or photo sharing websites, steganographer may intentionally recompress cover image several times with quantization matrix of targeted channel, which thereby make it possible to transmit stego data in such channel for better disguise. In addition, there are huge number of cover JPEG images may be recompressed for various reasons, such as processing by some tools. Thus a better steganalysis method for such images is needed. In this paper, we investigate the steganalysis method for images recompressed with the same quantization matrix, namely, discriminate recompressed JPEG cover images and its stego images. We present some observed phenomenon on recompressed JPEG images, and design methods to enhance the sensitivity of feature based and deep model based steganalysis methods for this task. To verify their effectiveness with different acquisition of recompression prior-knowledge, we conduct experiments in various settings including conventional setting and mixing samples of different recompressing times in training. Their results demonstrate that the proposed method can notably improve detection accuracy on recompressed JPEG images.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "1111129", "output": "\"Structural Properties of Optimal k-Plane Graphs: Separation into 1-Plane and Plane Forests\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A topological graph is k-plane, k>0, if each edge is crossed at most k times. We study the problem of partitioning the edges of a k-plane graph such that each partite set forms a graph with a simpler structure. While this problem has been studied for k=1, we focus on optimal 2-plane and on optimal 3-plane graphs, which are 2-plane and 3-plane graphs with maximum\u00a0density. We prove the following results. (i)\u00a0It is not possible to partition the edges of a simple (i.e., with neither self-loops nor parallel edges) optimal 2-plane graph into a 1-plane graph and a forest, while (ii)\u00a0an edge partition formed by a 1-plane graph and two plane forests always exists and can be computed in linear time.

Various methods have been developed for inferring such trees, and comparing them is an important problem in computational phylogenetics. Addressing this problem requires tree measures, but all of them suffer from problems that can severely limit their applicability in practice. This also holds true for one of the oldest and most widely used tree measures, the Robinson-Foulds distance. While this measure is satisfying the properties of a metric and is efficiently computable, it has a negatively skewed distribution, a poor range of discrimination and diameter, and may not be robust when comparing erroneous trees. The cluster distance is a measure for comparing rooted trees that can be interpreted as a weighted version of the Robinson-Foulds distance. We show that when compared with the Robinson-Foulds distance, the cluster distance is much more robust towards small errors in the compared trees, and has a significantly improved distribution and range.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111131", "output": "\"Navigating the Cancer Continuum: A Patient-Centered Framework for Holistic Health Management\"\n\nor\n\n\"Navigating the Cancer Journey: A Holistic Framework for Patient-Centered Care\"\n\nor\n\n\"Cancer Survivorship and Beyond: A Patient-Centered Framework for Integrating Clinical and Daily Life Needs\"\n\nor \n\n\"N", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Individuals must cope with numerous physical and emotional challenges, balancing clinical tasks alongside responsibilities of daily life. Understanding the breadth of factors that contribute to a patient's cancer experience presents a critical challenge in developing holistic patient-centered technology.

We present a cancer journey framework depicting the responsibilities, challenges, and personal impacts patients face while transitioning from diagnosis through post-treatment survivorship. Through this work, we aim to aid the development of health tools that consider a patient's cancer journey and health needs more broadly, supporting patient's health management alongside the complexities and priorities of daily life.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111132", "output": "Iterative Decoding of Polar Codes through Low-Density Parity Check Codes and the Dual Representation of Polar Codes", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The slim fly network topology, a new low-diameter, low-latency, and low-cost interconnection network, is gaining interest as one possible solution for next-generation supercomputing interconnect systems. In this article, we present a high-fidelity slim fly packet-level model leveraging the Rensselaer Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS) and Co-Design of Exascale Storage (CODES) frameworks. We validate the model with published work before scaling the network size up to an unprecedented 1 million compute nodes and confirming that the slim fly observes peak network throughput at extreme scale. In addition to synthetic workloads, we evaluate large-scale slim fly models with real communication workloads from applications in the Design Forward program with over 110,000 MPI processes. We show strong scaling of the slim fly model on an Intel cluster achieving a peak network packet transfer rate of 2.3 million packets per second and processing over 7 billion discrete events using 128 MPI tasks. Enabled by the strong performance capabilities of the model, we perform a detailed application trace and routing protocol performance study. Through analysis of metrics such as packet latency, hop count, and congestion, we find that the slim fly network is able to leverage simple minimal routing and achieve the same performance as more complex adaptive routing for tested DOE benchmark applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "1111134", "output": "\"Reviving the QED Vision: A Decade of Advances in Mathematical Representation and Knowledge Management\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the scanned or camera-captured images sending to an ERP system are not always of good quality. In order to automate the auditing of certificates and bills, and to alleviate the low recognition rate caused by the low quality image in all kinds of certificates and bills automatic analysis and processing system, this paper proposes a method for detecting and filtering out images with low quality, leaving only high quality images, to improve the recognition rate of the auditing of certificates and bills.

We introduce two types of explanations for why a classifier may have classified an instance positively or negatively and suggest algorithms for computing these explanations. The first type of explanation identifies a minimal set of the currently active features that is responsible for the current classification, while the second type of explanation identifies a minimal set of features whose current state (active or not) is sufficient for the classification. We consider in particular the compilation of Naive and Latent-Tree Bayesian network classifiers into Ordered Decision Diagrams (ODDs), providing a context for evaluating our proposal using case studies and experiments based on classifiers from the literature.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.98}, {"id": "1111140", "output": "\"Adaptive Energy Management through Multi-Agent Systems: Balancing Environmental Optimization and User Comfort\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Adaptive Energy Management\", \"Multi-Agent Systems\"]\n[\"User-Centered Energy Efficiency\", \"Agreement Technologies\"]\n[\"Comfortable Energy Consumption\", \"Environmental Optimization\"]\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n\n</features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Many of the current state-of-the-art systems make decisions considering solely the environmental factors that cause the consumption of energy. These systems are successful at optimizing energy consumption; however, they do not adapt to the preferences of users and their comfort. Any system that is to be used by end-users should consider factors that affect their wellbeing. Thus, this article proposes an energy-saving system, which apart from considering the environmental conditions also adapts to the preferences of inhabitants. The architecture is based on a Multi-Agent System (MAS), its agents use Agreement Technologies (AT) to perform a negotiation process between the comfort preferences of the users and the degree of optimization that the system can achieve according to these preferences. A case study was conducted in an office building, showing that the proposed system achieved average energy savings of 17.15%.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111141", "output": "\"Optimizing Humanitarian Provisioning through AI-Driven Demand Forecasting and Supply Chain Coordination\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Multi-variant execution environments (MVEEs) add additional assurance by executing multiple, diversified copies (variants) of the same program in lockstep while monitoring their behavior for signs of attacks (divergence). While executing multiple copies of the same program requires additional computational resources, modern MVEEs run many workloads at near-native speed and can detect adversaries before they leak secrets or achieve persistence on the host system. Multi-threaded programs are challenging to execute in lockstep by an MVEE. If the threads in a set of variants are not scheduled in the exact same order, the variants will diverge from each other in terms of the system calls they make. While benign, such divergence undermines the MVEEs ability detect divergence caused by malicious program inputs. To address this problem, we developed an MVEE-specific synchronization scheme that lets us execute a set of multithreaded variants in lockstep without causing benign divergence. Our fully-fledged MVEE runs the PARSEC 2.1 and SPLASH-2x parallel benchmarks (with four worker threads per variant) with a slowdown of less than 15% relative to unprotected execution. Addressing this longstanding compatibility issue makes MVEEs a viable defense for a far greater range of realistic workloads.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "1111143", "output": "Robust Adaptive Control of Coaxial-Rotor Micro-Aerial Vehicles via Neural Network-Based State-Feedback and Observer Design", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the operation of them is usually subject to unpredictable time-varying aerodynamic disturbances and model uncertainties. In this paper, an adaptive robust controller based on a neural network (NN) approach is proposed to reject such perturbations and track both the desired position and orientation trajectories. A complete dynamic model of a CRMAV is first constructed. When all system states are assumed to be available, an NN-based state-feedback controller is proposed through feedback linearization and Lyapunov analysis. Furthermore, to overcome the practical challenge that certain states are not measurable, a high-gain observer is introduced to estimate the unavailable states, and then, an output-feedback controller is developed. Rigorous theoretical analysis verifies the stability of the entire closed-loop system. In addition, extensive simulation studies are conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "1111144", "output": "Relational Network-Based Approaches for Effective Automatic Document Classification: Leveraging Term Relationships for Improved Performance", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

One such simplification is to consider independent the terms that compose documents, which may hide important relationships between them. These relationships can encapsulate non-trivial and effective patterns to improve classification effectiveness. In this work, we propose NetClass, a new network-based model for documents that explicitly considers term relationships and introduce a family of relational algorithms for ADC, such as the LRN-WRN classifier\u2014a lazy relational ADC algorithm that not only exploits relationships between terms but also neighborhood information. As our extensive experimental evaluation shows, the proposed LRN-WRM achieves competitive performance when compared to the state-of-the-art in ADC, including SVM, considering seven distinct domains. More specifically, LRN-WRN outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers in 5 out of 7 domains, being within the top-2 best-performing classifier in all assessed domains. Our evaluation highlights the high effectiveness of our proposal, as well as its efficiency in terms of runtime. Indeed, besides effectiveness and efficiency, the simplicity and the absence of a complex parameter tuning of our proposal are key characteristics that make our algorithms interesting alternatives for ADC. Particularly, as highlighted by our experimental evaluation, LRN-WRM was shown to be a promising alternative to dynamic domains with a huge volume of short texts (e.g., social media content) or with several classes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111145", "output": "\"Efficient Processing of Multi-Source Top-k Queries with Partially Specified Weights via Fagin's Algorithm Adaptation and Novel FSA Optimization\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although efficient (instance optimal) algorithms exist to this purpose (such as the Threshold Algorithm TA and its variants) none of them is able to deal with scenarios in which the function used to aggregate scores is only partially specified. This is the typical case when the function is a weighted sum, and the user is unable to provide precise values for the weights. In this paper, we consider the problem of processing multi-source top-k queries, when only constraints, rather than precise values, are available for the weights. After observing that the so-called Faginu0027s Algorithm (FA) can be adapted to solve the problem, yet only when no constraints at all are present (a case in which our queries will return the k-skyband of the dataset), we introduce the novel FSA algorithm, which we prove to be instance optimal for any set of constraints on the weights. We also propose several optimizations to the basic FSA logic so as to improve execution times. Experimental analysis on both real and synthetic datasets shows that our optimizations are indeed highly effective and that the increased flexibility provided by FSA introduces little overhead with respect to the case of classical top-k queries.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "1111146", "output": "Based on the provided features, I'll generate a title for the abstract.

It has captured significant attention of academia, industries, and government bodies. Now, it has emerged as the backbone of modern economy by offering subscription-based services anytime, anywhere following a pay-as-you-go model. This has instigated (1) shorter establishment times for start-ups, (2) creation of scalable global enterprise applications, (3) better cost-to-value associativity for scientific and high-performance computing applications, and (4) different invocation/execution models for pervasive and ubiquitous applications. The recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing, software-defined networking, Internet of Things, and processing at network edge are creating new opportunities for Cloud computing. However, they are also posing several new challenges and creating the need for new approaches and research strategies, as well as the re-evaluation of the models that were developed to address issues such as scalability, elasticity, reliability, security, sustainability, and application models. The proposed manifesto addresses them by identifying the major open challenges in Cloud computing, emerging trends, and impact areas. It then offers research directions for the next decade, thus helping in the realisation of Future Generation Cloud Computing.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111147", "output": "\"Multimodal Addressee Detection for Multiparty Dialogue Systems: A Comparative Analysis of Acoustic, Lexical, and System-State Features\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

When a dialogue system interacts with multiple users, it is crucial to detect when a user is speaking to the system as opposed to another person. We study this problem in a multimodal scenario, using lexical, acoustic, visual, dialogue state, and beamforming information. Using data from a multiparty dialogue system, we quantify the benefits of using multiple modalities over using a single modality. We also assess the relative importance of the various modalities, as well as of key individual features, in estimating the addressee. We find that energy-based acoustic features are by far the most important, that information from speech recognition and system state is useful as well, and that visual and beamforming features provide little additional benefit. While we find that head pose is affected by whom the speaker is addressing, it yields little nonredundant information due to the system acting as a situational attractor. Our findings would be relevant to multiparty, open-world dialogue systems in which the agent plays an active, conversational role, such as an interactive assistant deployed in a public, open space. For these scenarios , our study suggests that acoustic, lexical, and system-state information is an effective and practical combination of modalities to use for addressee detection. We also consider how our analyses might be affected by the ongoing development of more realistic, natural dialogue systems.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "1111148", "output": "Distributed Self-Stabilizing Protocol Synthesis from Temporal Behavior and Network Topology without Explicit State Descriptions", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our proposed methods are fully implemented and we report successful synthesis of well-known protocols such as Dijkstra's token ring, a self-stabilizing version of Raymond's mutual exclusion algorithm, ideal-stabilizing leader election and local mutual exclusion, as well as monotonic-stabilizing maximal independent set and distributed Grundy coloring.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "1111149", "output": "\"Adaptive Discriminative Strategies for Exponential Rate Exploration in Interruptible Multi-Armed Bandits\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The proposed approach is aimed to generalize other existing models whose scope is restricted to removing individual and unrelated nodes. We consider two common metrics to quantify the connectivity of the residual graph: the total number of connected node pairs and the size of the largest connected component. We first discuss the computational complexity of the problem and then introduce a general mixed-integer linear formulation, which depending on the kind of node structures, may have an exponentially large number of variables and constraints. To solve this potentially large model, we develop a branch-price-and-cut framework, along with some valid inequalities and preprocessing algorithms to strengthen the formulation and reduce the overall execution time. We use the proposed approach to solve the problem for the cases, where the node structures form cliques or stars and provide further directions on how to extend the framework for detecting other kinds of critical structures as well. Finally, we test the quality of our approach by solving a collection of real-life and randomly generated instances with various configurations, analyze the benefits of our model, and propose further enhancements.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "1111151", "output": "Multiset Space-Time Shift Keying for Enhanced Millimeter-Wave Communications: A Multiuser Steered Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Due to large luminance levels and higher brightness of HDR displays, artefacts can be more noticeable to the Human Visual System (HVS). In a first attempt to experimentally quantify those noticeable levels for HDR images, we pioneered in conducting an exhaustive and comprehensive Just Noticeable Difference (JND) subjective experiment of which the outcome is presented in this paper. Six distortions including JPEG, JPEG2000, noise, blur, contrast change, and quantization artefacts have been considered in the test. The distortions were applied to 10 HDR images in 100 distortion levels resulting a database of 6000 HDR test images. The subjects were asked to find the image JND location on each set of 100 images they had the freedom to explore. The effect of content features on the noticeable threshold selection is investigated per distortion type. Our results in some cases show a significant correlation between content features and JNDs. We are hoping that our results can contribute to further exploitation of a precise HVS model for HDR quality assessment and optimization of the coding and bit allocation in HDR compression.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111153", "output": "Optimizing Motion Planning for Perception: A Novel Heuristic for Robot Path Planning in Dynamic Environments", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A robot has to move to a position from where it can sense the target, while minimizing both motion and perception costs. The problem of finding paths for robots executing perception tasks can be solved optimally using informed search. In perception path planning, the solution when considering a straight line without obstacles is used as heuristic. In this work, we propose a heuristic that can improve the search efficiency. In order to reduce the node expansion using a more informed search, we use the robot Approximate Visibility Map (A-VM), which is used as a representation of the observability capability of a robot in a given environment. We show how the critical points used in A-VM provide information on the geometry of the environment, which can be used to improve the heuristic, increasing the search efficiency. The critical points allow a better estimation of the minimum motion and perception cost for targets in non-traversable regions that can only be sensed from further away. Finally, we show the contributed heuristic with improvements dominates the base PA* heuristic built on the euclidean distance, and then present the results of the performance increase in terms of node expansion and computation time.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "1111154", "output": "\"Parametric Equilibrium Profiles in Three-Player Kuhn Poker: A Novel Family of Strategies with Transferrable Utility\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Considering that group roles are conditioned (among other factors) by collaborative skills that students manifest, this article explores relations between collaborative skills and group roles by means of the application of association rules over a dataset of university students' interactions during CSCL sessions. The discovered knowledge might be used for automatic recognition of student roles based on collaborative skills that students manifest in their groups. Furthermore, the discovered association rules could be used for forming groups with a balanced combination of roles.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111156", "output": "\"Robust Vector Filters: Minimax Approximations for Efficient Color Image Processing\"\n\nor \n\n\"Minimax Optimization of Vector Operators for Impulsive Noise Reduction in Digital Color Imaging\"\n\nor \n\n\"Balancing Efficiency and Accuracy in Vector Filter Design using Minimax Approximation Theory\"\n\nor \n\n\"Efficient Vector Filtering for Color Images", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These operators often have very high computational requirements, which limits their use in time-critical applications. This paper introduces techniques to speed up vector filters using the minimax approximation theory. Extensive experiments on a large and diverse set of color images show that proposed approximations achieve an excellent balance among ease of implementation, accuracy, and computational speed.

While the methylation status of individual cytosines can sometimes be informative, several recent papers have shown that the functional role of DNA methylation is better captured by a quantitative analysis of the spatial variation of methylation across a genomic region. Results: Here, we present BPRMeth, a Bioconductor package that quantifies methylation profiles by generalized linear model regression. The original implementation has been enhanced in two important ways: we introduced a fast, variational inference approach that enables the quantification of Bayesian posterior confidence measures on the model, and we adapted the method to use several observation models, making it suitable for a diverse range of platforms including single-cell analyses and methylation arrays.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.01}, {"id": "1111158", "output": "\"Simultaneous Architecture and Meta-Weight Optimization via Progressive Connection Consolidation for Efficient Meta-Learning\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Current gradient-based meta-learning methods concentrate on finding good model-agnostic initialization (meta-weights) for learners. In this paper, we aim to obtain better meta-learners by co-optimizing the architecture and meta-weights simultaneously. Existing NAS-based meta-learning methods apply a two-stage strategy, i.e., first searching architectures and then re-training meta-weights on the searched architecture. However, this two-stage strategy would break the mutual impact of the architecture and meta-weights since they are optimized separately. Differently, we propose progressive connection consolidation, fixing the architecture layer by layer, in which the layer with the largest weight value would be fixed first. In this way, we can jointly search architectures and train the meta-weights on fixed layers. Besides, to improve the generalization performance of the searched meta-learner on all tasks, we propose a more effective rule for co-optimization, namely Connection-Adaptive Meta-learning (CAML). By searching only once, we can obtain both adaptive architecture and meta-weights for meta-learning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 3x less computational cost, revealing our method's effectiveness and efficiency.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "1111159", "output": "Adaptive Squish Representation for Multilayer Layout Hotspot Detection in Deep Neural Networks", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It aims to find potential weak points in layouts before feeding them into manufacturing stage. Rapid development of machine learning has made it a preferable alternative of traditional hotspot detection solutions. Recent researches range from layout feature extraction and learning model design. However, only single layer layout hotspots are considered in state-of-the-art hotspot detectors and certain defects such as metal-to-via failures are not naturally supported. In this paper, we propose an adaptive squish representation for multilayer layouts, which is storage efficient, lossless and compatible with deep neural networks. We conduct experiments on 14nm industrial designs with a metal layer and its two adjacent via layers that contain metal-to-via hotspots. Results show that the adaptive squish representation can achieve satisfactory hotspot detection accuracy by incorporating a medium-sized convolutional neural networks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "1111160", "output": "Robust Censored Adaptive Algorithm for Impulsive Noise with Non-Gaussian Background: A Novel Approach to Enhance Performance and Theoretical Insights", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These statistics are simply rescaled before machine learning. It is noted that SRM features of different cover images are very different. In this paper, we propose a feature normalization method based on random feature-subsets (NRS) for SRM. We randomly draw feature-subsets from SRM feature. Then these feature-subsets are normalized by using per-sample rescaling method to make the feature-subsets of different images have the same 1-norm (the sum of all elements). The proposed NRS method can adjust the feature distribution and increase the feature diversity. The normalized feature-subsets can achieve better detection performance and also can be used as a useful complement for the existing steganalysis features. Experimental results show that: (1) a small amount of normalized feature-subset supplement can obviously improve the detection performance of SRM feature; (2) under the same dimensionality, the proposed NRS version feature can achieve a better detection accuracy than that of original feature; (3) the proposed NRS method is applicable to projections of spatial rich model feature; (4) compared with steganalysis feature extraction, the computational time of NRS can be negligible.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111162", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.

In contrast to popular end-to-end deep learning solutions, we propose a hybrid method with an existing semantic segmentation network to extract semantic information and a traditional LiDAR point cloud cluster algorithm to split each instance object. We argue geometry-based traditional clustering algorithms are worth being considered by showing a state-of-the-art performance among all published end-to-end deep learning solutions on the panoptic segmentation leaderboard of the Semantic KITTI dataset. To our best knowledge, we are the first to attempt the point cloud panoptic segmentation with clustering algorithms. Therefore, instead of working on new models, we give a comprehensive technical survey in this paper by implementing four typical cluster methods and report their performances on the benchmark. Those four cluster methods are the most representative ones with real-time running speed. They are implemented with C++ in this paper and then wrapped as a python function for seamless integration with the existing deep learning frameworks. We release our code for peer researchers who might be interested in this problem(1).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111163", "output": "Personalized Health Discovery through Semantic Recommender Systems: A Novel Approach to Informing Personalized Medicine", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Web browsers are in the center of such activities. In this paper, we analyze the I/O characteristics of five popular web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Dolphin, and UC. We chose a website that has 52 objects and 509KB as the sum of all the objects. After analyzing the ratio of read and write I/Os, we found that browsing is a write-intensive activity. Three of the browsers issued more than 50% of I/Os using fsync() and fdatasync(). About 50% of I/Os are for updating file system metadata and journal. The number of I/Os that a browser generates for SQLite and cache files is more than 50% at the lowest and 90% at the highest of the total I/O counts. In this paper, we define write amplification of web browsers to address the amount of extra I/Os browsers generate. We found that web browsers write on average of 11.7 times more data to the storage than the sum of original web contents.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.8}, {"id": "1111165", "output": "Reconstructing Gene Regulatory Networks with Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines: A Robust Approach via Ensemble Learning and Part Mutual Information", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The problem of reconstructing GRNs has been studied for decades. Most of existing methods infer the GRNs from gene expression data. Previous studies use random forest, partial least squares or other feature selection techniques to solve it. In this paper, we propose a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) based method to estimate the feature importance and reconstruct the GRNs. MARS can catch the nonlinear relationships between genes. To avoid the overfitting and make the estimation robust, we apply an ensemble model of MARS based on bootstrap and weighted features by PMI (Part mutual information), called PBMarsNet. The results show that PBMarsNet performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111166", "output": "\"Resolution-Agnostic Deep Learning for Blind Image Quality Assessment: A Residual Network Approach Leveraging Histogram-Based Labeling\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our method is trained on full and arbitrarily sized images rather than small image patches or resized input images as usually done in CNNs for image classification and quality assessment. The resolution independence is achieved by pyramid pooling. This work is the first that applies a fine-tuned residual deep learning network (ResNet-101) to BIQA. The training is carried out on a new and very large, labeled dataset of 10, 073 images (KonIQ-10k) that contains quality rating histograms besides the mean opinion scores (MOS). In contrast to previous methods we do not train to approximate the MOS directly, but rather use the distributions of scores. Experiments were carried out on three benchmark image quality databases. The results showed clear improvements of the accuracy of the estimated MOS values, compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms. We also report on the quality of the estimation of the score distributions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "1111167", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\nPredicting User Engagement with Search\nPredicting User Experience with Search Interfaces\nUsing Log Files for Automatic User Engagement Assessment\nAnalyzing User Engagement Dimensions through Search Behaviour\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- Use of \"beh", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While standard techniques for measuring user engagement use questionnaires, these are obtrusive to user interaction, and can only be collected at acceptable intervals. The problem we address is whether there is a less obtrusive and more automatic way to assess how users perceive the search process and outcome. Log files collect behavioural signals (e.g., clicks, queries) from users on a large scale. In this paper, we investigate the potential to predict how users perceive engagement with search by modelling behavioural signals from log files using supervised learning methods. We focus on different engagement dimensions (Perceived Usability, Felt Involvement, Endurability and Novelty) and examine how 37 behavioural features can inform these dimensions. Our results, obtained from 377 in-lab participants undergoing goal-based search tasks, support the connection between perceived engagement and search behaviour. More specifically, we show that time- and query-related features are best suited for predicting user perceived engagement, and suggest that different behavioural features better reflect specific dimensions. We demonstrate the possibility of predicting user-perceived engagement using search behavioural features.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111168", "output": "Distribution-Preserving Steganography with Generative Models for Sampled and Compressed Data", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

There are two distribution-preserving steganographic frameworks, one is sampler-based and the other is compression-based. The former requires a perfect sampler which yields data following the same distribution, and the latter needs the explicit distribution of generative objects. However, these two conditions are too strict even unrealistic in the traditional data environment, e.g., the distribution of natural images is hard to seize. Fortunately, generative models bring new vitality to distribution-preserving steganography, which can serve as the perfect sampler or provide the explicit distribution of generative media. Taking text-to-speech generation task as an example, we propose distribution-preserving steganography based on WaveGlow and WaveRNN, which corresponds to the former two categories. Steganalysis experiments and theoretical analysis are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed methods can preserve the distribution.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "1111169", "output": "\"Varying Sparse Coded Multiple Access for High-Load 5G Cellular Systems: A Comparative Analysis of Error Rate Performance and Receiver Complexity\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Nonetheless, most of the existing works focused on the cost optimization of the entire process, while the cost of individual participants cannot be considered. In this article, we explore a min-max cost-optimal problem to guarantee the convergence rate of federated learning in terms of cost in wireless edge networks. In particular, we minimize the cost of the worst-case participant subject to the delay, local CPU-cycle frequency, power allocation, local accuracy, and subcarrier assignment constraints. Considering that the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we decompose it into several sub-problems to derive its solutions, in which the subcarrier assignment and power allocation are obtained by utilizing the Lagrangian dual decomposition method, the CPU-cycle frequency is obtained by a heuristic algorithm, and the local accuracy is obtained by an iteration algorithm. Simulation results show the convergence of the proposed algorithm and reveal that the proposed scheme can accomplish a tradeoff between the cost and fairness by comparing the proposed scheme with the existing schemes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111171", "output": "\"Enhancing Reusability Assessment: A Novel Synthesis of Software Metrics for Predictive and Discriminative Power\"\n\nor\n\n\"A Comprehensive Framework for Reusability Evaluation: Integrating Structural, External, and Documentation Aspects\"\n\nor\n\n\"Reusability Index for Open-Source Assets: A Comparative Study of Predict", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To alleviate these shortcomings, we introduce a reusability index (REI) as a synthesis of various software metrics that cover a number of related reusability aspects. Furthermore, we evaluate its ability to quantify reuse, by comparing it to existing indices through a case study on 15 reusable open-source assets (i.e., libraries and frameworks). The results of the study suggest that the proposed index presents the highest predictive and discriminative power, it is the most consistent in ranking reusable assets, and the most strongly correlated to their levels of reuse.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111172", "output": "Automated Discovery of Multi-Perspective Declarative Process Models: A Clustering-Classifier Approach for Complex Event Logs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Traditional automated process discovery techniques are designed to produce procedural process models as output (e.g., in the BPMN notation). However, when confronted to complex event logs, automatically discovered process models can become too complex to be practically usable. An alternative approach is to discover declarative process models, which represent the behavior of the process in terms of a set of business constraints. These approaches have been shown to produce simpler process models, especially in the context of processes with high levels of variability. However, the bulk of approaches for automated discovery of declarative process models are focused on the control-flow perspective of business processes and do not cover other perspectives, e.g., the data, time, and resource perspectives. In this paper, we present an approach for the automated discovery of multi-perspective declarative process models able to discover conditions involving arbitrary (categorical or numeric) data attributes, which relate the occurrence of pairs of events in the log. To discover such correlated conditions, we use clustering techniques in conjunction with interpretable classifiers. The approach has been implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype and tested on both synthetic and real-life logs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "1111173", "output": "\"Partially Invariant Patterns for Efficient Linear-Feedback Shift-Register Based Test Data Compression\"\n\nor\n\n\"Beyond Scan-In State: Utilizing Partially Invariant Patterns for Optimized LFSR-Based Broadside Test Generation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Enhancing Test Data Compression with Partially Invariant Patterns for Linear-Feedback", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Existing metrics for the proximity to functional operation conditions are based on the scan-in state. For example, they consider the distance between the scan-in state and a reachable state (a state that the circuit can visit during functional operation). However, the deviation from functional operation conditions can increase during a test beyond the deviation that is measured by the scan-in state. To ensure that the deviation does not increase, this article introduces the concept of a partially invariant pattern. The article describes a procedure for extracting partially invariant patterns from functional broadside tests whose scan-in states are reachable states. Being partially specified, partially invariant patterns are suitable for test data compression. The article studies the use of partially invariant patterns for linear-feedback shift-register (LFSR) based test data compression. Noting that a seed may not exist for a given partially invariant pattern with a given LFSR, the procedure described in this article uses an iterative process that not only matches a seed to a partially invariant pattern, but also adjusts the partially invariant pattern based on the test that the seed produces. The article also addresses the selection of LFSRs for the generation of close-to-functional broadside tests based on partially invariant patterns. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the procedure.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111174", "output": "Based on the provided features, I can generate a title for the abstract.

Instead of stacking several level of transistors to implement a two inputs XOR gate, a p-type differential pair is used to steer the current in n-type differential pairs through current mirrors. The proposed topology allows to reduce the minimum supply voltage of MCML XOR gates while guaranteeing a fully current mode behavior as in the conventional XOR gate. The proposed topology has been compared against the conventional and triple tail MCML XOR gates.

Such applications would require continuous evaluation of frequently changing data (smartphone sensors and IoT sensors), and continuous polling of IoT sensor data to the phone. Offloading both the evaluation and the polling of IoT sensor data to the cloud would improve energy efficiency and data transfer costs for the phone. To this end, we built Cowbird, an energy efficient framework to help developers easily build applications that evaluate sensor data both on the phone and in the cloud. To show that Cowbird is flexible and easy to use, we built a prototype app called \"Quiet Route\" that helps the user to avoid walking through noisy areas. We also compare the performance of Cowbird and the existing Cuckoo framework in terms of energy efficiency, data transfer cost and CPU load and show that Cowbird performs much better in the best case and equally good in the worst case.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.91}, {"id": "1111177", "output": "Contextualizing Activity Recognition: A Critical Examination of the Limitations and Opportunities for Real-Time Adaptation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The process consists of gathering anonymous interaction and skeletal data of passersby during public display deployment and programmatically analyzing the data. This article demonstrates the use of the process with the analysis of the Information Wall, a gesture-controlled public information display. Information Wall was deployed in a university campus for one year and collected an extensive data set of more than 100 000 passersby. The main benefits of the process include (1) gathering of large data sets without considerable use of resources, (2) fast, semi-automated data analysis, and (3) applicability to studying the effects of long-term public display deployments. In analyzing the usage and passersby data of the Information Wall in our validation study, the main findings uncovered using the method were (i) most users were first-time users exploring the system, and not many returned to use the system again, and (ii) many users were accompanied by passive users who observed interaction from further away, which could suggest a case of multi-user interaction blindness. In the past, logged data has mainly been used as a supporting method for in situ observations and interviews, and its use has required a considerable amount of manual work. In this article, we argue that logged data analysis can be automated to complement other methods, particularly in the evaluation of long-term deployments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "1111179", "output": "\"Finite Index Optimizations for Bounded Pathwidth and Treewidth Problems\"\n\nor \n\n\"Finite Index Properties of OPTIMAL PATHWIDTH and TREEWIDTH Problems on Bounded Graph Classes\"\n\nor \n\n\"Bounded Pathwidth and Treewidth Restrictions Yield Finite Index Optimizations\"\n\nor \n\n\"Finite Index Results for OPTIMAL PATHWIDTH and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Low latency is preconditioned on low hop counts, but existing network topologies have hop counts much larger than theoretical lower bounds. The degree diameter problem (DDP) has been studied for decades and consists in generating the largest possible graph given degree and diameter constraints, striving to approach theoretical upper bounds. To generate network topologies with low hop counts we propose using best known DDP solutions as starting points for generating topologies of arbitrary size. Using discrete-event simulation, we quantify the performance of representative parallel applications when executed on our proposed topologies, on previously proposed fully random topologies, and on a classical non-random topology.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "1111181", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generated the following title:\n\n\"Coordinated Multipoint Scheduling and Network Function Virtualization for Efficient CoMP in Dense Small Cell Networks\"\n\nor \n\n\"Joint Optimization of Coordinated Scheduling and Network Function Virtualization for CoMP in 5G Small Cell Scenarios\"\n\nor \n\n\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Dense deployment of small cells can provide a valid solution but are prone to high levels of interference especially at the cell-edge. However, to reduce inter-cell interference and improve cell-edge throughput, a set of techniques known as Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) has been introduced. Coordinated Scheduling (CS) is a CoMP technique that assigns resources to mobile users to avoid interference between users that are assigned within the same Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs). On the other hand, Software Defined Mobile Networking (SDMN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) represent two key technologies to enhance flexibility and efficiency of resource usage within the Radio Access Network (RAN). However, the implementation of CoMP CS techniques on NFV architecture in a dense small cell scenario have not been analyzed yet. In this paper, we propose the joint use of CoMP CS and NFV by studying the implications of different deployment strategies, as constrained by the physical topology of the underlying RAN. The performance of both distributed and centralized CoMP CS are compared in terms of convergence delay and traffic overhead. Guidelines for the optimal design are provided.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111182", "output": "Evaluating the Impact of Form-Factor Advancements on the Effectiveness of Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays in Critical Situations", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Analysis shows that in most cases our results can be significantly less conservative than the lower bounds obtained elsewhere using more sophisticated, general LTI controllers.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "1111184", "output": "\"Enhancing Topic Model Evaluation for Assessing Document Topical Diversity via Hierarchical Re-estimation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A recent proposal for measuring topical diversity identifies three elements for assessing diversity: words, topics, and documents as collections of words. Topic models play a central role in this approach. Using standard topic models for measuring diversity of documents is suboptimal due to generality and impurity. General topics only include common information from a background corpus and are assigned to most of the documents in the collection. Impure topics contain words that are not related to the topic; impurity lowers the interpretability of topic models and impure topics are likely to get assigned to documents erroneously. We propose a hierarchical re-estimation approach for topic models to combat generality and impurity; the proposed approach operates at three levels: words, topics, and documents. Our re-estimation approach for measuring documents' topical diversity outperforms the state of the art on PubMed dataset which is commonly used for diversity experiments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "1111185", "output": "Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Dynamic Skyline Query over Encrypted Data for Online Medical Diagnosis Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In the system, to make a more accurate diagnosis, doctors wish to obtain some archived medical data records, which are similar to the sensed patient data, to learn from the prior diagnoses. As a practically useful similarity search, the dynamic skyline query can provide doctors with similar data records having all possible relative weights of attributes. Driven by the powerful cloud, the data owner often outsources encrypted data and the corresponding services, e.g., dynamic skyline query services here, to a third-party cloud. As a result, it is required to perform the dynamic skyline query over encrypted data. However, existing schemes are either insecure or inefficient. To address the issue, in this article, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving dynamic skyline query scheme and use it in an online medical diagnosis system. Specifically, based on symmetric homomorphic encryption (SHE), we present a set of efficient and secure protocols to achieve various operations, such as less than comparison, equality test, and dominance determination, without leaking any sensitive information to the cloud. With these secure protocols, we carefully design our dynamic skyline query scheme to attain full security and high efficiency at the same time. Detailed security analysis shows that our proposed scheme is indeed privacy-preserving. With extensive experimental evaluations, we show that our proposed scheme outperforms the alternative scheme by two orders of magnitude in the computational cost and at least \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$8.1\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n in the communication cost.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "1111186", "output": "Combining the Similar Abstract-Title Pairs and Features, I'll generate a title.\n\nTitle: \nOptimizing Iris Recognition Performance through Score-Level Fusion in Mobile Device Captured Visible Light Datasets", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For further improvement, an alternative approach that is based on machine learning techniques has been developed. The machine learning based approach can employ a fine-grained model that includes much richer feature representations with the ability to fit the training data. Although a machine learning based fine-grained model achieved extremely high performance in prediction accuracy, a possibility of the risk of overfitting for such model has been reported. Results: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction that integrates the thermodynamic approach and the machine learning based weighted approach. Our fine-grained model combines the experimentally determined thermodynamic parameters with a large number of scoring parameters for detailed contexts of features that are trained by the structured support vector machine (SSVM) with the l(1) regularization to avoid overfitting. Our benchmark shows that our algorithm achieves the best prediction accuracy compared with existing methods, and heavy overfitting cannot be observed.

This paper is concerned with the solution procedure of a TP in which transportation costs are represented in terms of intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers and supplies and demands are real numbers. We first formulate the intuitionistic fuzzy TP (IFTP) and then propose a new solution technique to solve the problem. Based on the proposed approach, the IFTP is converted into a Multi Objective Linear Programming (MOLP) problem with five objective functions. Then, a lexicographic approach is used to obtain the efficient solution of the resulting MOLP problem. The optimization process confirms that the optimum intuitionistic fuzzy transportation cost preserves the form of an intuitionistic triangular fuzzy number. A simple numerical example is included to illustrate of the proposed technique. The obtained results confirm the reliability and applicability of the proposed approach.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.84}, {"id": "1111190", "output": "\"Unifying Implicit Complexity: Bridging Programs and Finite Structures through Primitive-Recursive Characterization\"\n\nor\n\n\"Primitive-Recursive Complexity of Uninterpreted Programs: A Novel Approach to Implicit Computational Complexity\"\n\nor\n\n\"Closing the Gap: Primitive-Recursive Characterization of Implicit Computational Complexity via Uninterpreted Programs\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We thus bridge the gap between the two approaches above to implicit complexity, with the potential of streamlining and clarifying important tools and techniques, such as set-existence and ramification.  illustrate this potential by delineating a broad class of programs, based on the notion of loop variant familiar from imperative program construction, that characterizes a generic notion of primitive-recursive complexity, without reference to any data-driven recurrence.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.1}, {"id": "1111191", "output": "Detecting Overlapping Community Structures in Incomplete Social Networks via Regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and Influential Node Selection", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, most social network data are collected from partially observable networks with both missing nodes and edges. In this article, we address a new problem of detecting overlapping community structures in the context of such an incomplete network, where communities in the network are allowed to overlap since nodes belong to multiple communities at once. To solve this problem, we introduce KroMFac, a new framework that conducts community detection via regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) based on the Kronecker graph model. Specifically, from an inferred Kronecker generative parameter matrix, we first estimate the missing part of the network. As our major contribution to the proposed framework, to improve community detection accuracy, we then characterize and select influential nodes (which tend to have high degrees) by ranking, and add them to the existing graph.

While many tools and coverage metrics exist to support testers at the code level, not much support is targeted for testers who want to inspect the output of a program such as a dynamic web application. To support this category of testers, we propose a family of output-coverage metrics (similar to statement, branch, and path coverage metrics on code) that measure how much of the possible output has been produced by a test suite and what parts of the output are still uncovered. To do that, we first approximate the output universe using our existing symbolic execution technique. Then, given a set of test cases, we map the produced outputs onto the output universe to identify the covered and uncovered parts and compute output-coverage metrics. In our empirical evaluation on seven real-world PHP web applications, we show that selecting test cases by output coverage is more effective at identifying presentation faults such as HTML validation errors and spelling errors than selecting test cases by traditional code coverage. In addition, to help testers understand output coverage and augment test cases, we also develop a tool called WebTest that displays the output universe in one single web page and allows testers to visually explore covered and uncovered parts of the output.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.13}, {"id": "1111194", "output": "\"Foundational Concepts for Enterprise Systems Development: A Novel Approach to Value Creation and Interoperability\"\n\nor \n\n\"Ontology Research for Enterprise Systems: Enabling Value Creation, Development, and Interoperability\"\n\nor \n\n\"Foundations of Enterprise Systems: Ontology Research for Interoperability and Value Creation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, these methods are content sensitive with little consideration of image content variations, which causes variant estimations for images with different contents but same blurriness degrees. In this paper, a content-insensitive blind image blurriness assessment metric is developed utilizing Weibull statistics. Inspired by the property that the statistics of image gradient magnitude (GM) follows Weibull distribution, we parameterize the GM using \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\beta$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n (scale parameter) and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gamma$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n (shape parameter) of Weibull distribution. We also adopt skewness (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\eta$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n) to measure the asymmetry of the GM distribution. In order to reduce the influence of image content and achieve more robust performance, divisive normalization is then incorporated to moderate the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\beta$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n, \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gamma$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n, and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\eta$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n. The final image quality is predicted using a sparse extreme learning machine. Performances evaluation on the blur image subsets in LIVE, CSIQ, TID2008, and TID2013 databases demonstrate that the proposed method is highly correlated with human perception and robust with image contents. In addition, our method has low computational complexity which is suitable for online applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "1111196", "output": "Honouring the Legacy of Mark Hepworth: A Tribute to his Enduring Impact on Library and Information Science", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The algebra makes use of a synchronous parallel operator motivated by Aczelu0027s trace model of concurrency and with similarities to Milneru0027s SCCS. This paper looks at defining a form of fairness within the program algebra. The encoding allows one to reason about the fair execution of a single process in isolation as well as define fair-parallel in terms of a base parallel operator, of which no fairness properties are assumed. An algebraic theory to support fairness and fair-parallel is developed.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "1111198", "output": "\"Reducing Data Transmission in Biomedical Signal Processing via Compressed Sensing: A Rakeness-Based Approach\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A deep learning training job is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Efficient resource scheduling is the key to the maximal performance of a deep learning cluster. Existing cluster schedulers are largely not tailored to deep learning jobs, and typically specifying a fixed amount of resources for each job, prohibiting high resource efficiency and job performance. This paper proposes Optimus, a customized job scheduler for deep learning clusters, which minimizes job training time based on online resource-performance models. Optimus uses online fitting to predict model convergence during training, and sets up performance models to accurately estimate training speed as a function of allocated resources in each job. Based on the models, a simple yet effective method is designed and used for dynamically allocating resources and placing deep learning tasks to minimize job completion time. We implement Optimus on top of Kubernetes, a cluster manager for container orchestration, and experiment on a deep learning cluster with 7 CPU servers and 6 GPU servers, running 9 training jobs using the MXNet framework. Results show that Optimus outperforms representative cluster schedulers by about 139% and 63% in terms of job completion time and makespan, respectively.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "1111200", "output": "Optimizing Exploration in Dynamic Carrier Graphs: A Study on the Trade-Offs Between Computability and Complexity", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These graphs naturally model highly dynamic infrastructure-less networks such as public transports with fixed timetables, low earth orbiting (LEO) satellite systems, security guards' tours, etc. We focus on the opportunistic exploration of these graphs, that is by an agent that exploits the movements of the carriers to move in the network. We establish necessary conditions for the problem to be solved. We also derive lower bounds on the amount of time required in general, as well as for the carrier graphs defined by restricted classes of carrier movements. We then prove that the limitations on computability and complexity we have established are indeed tight. In fact we prove that all necessary conditions are also sufficient and all lower bounds on costs are tight. We do so constructively by presenting two optimal solution algorithms, one for anonymous systems, and one for those with distinct node IDs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "1111201", "output": "\"Singularity-Free Reference Rotation Generation for SE(3) Controllers: A Novel Method for Incremental and Stable Rotation Synthesis\"\n\nor \n\n\"Eliminating Rotational Singularities in SE(3) Geometric Controllers: A Novel Approach to Incremental Reference Rotation Generation\"\n\nor \n\n\"Robust Reference Rotation Generation for SE", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In particular, Reddit users freely discuss such issues on various subreddits, whose structure and content can be leveraged to formally interpret and relate subreddits and their posts in terms of mental health diagnostic categories. There is prior research on the extraction of mental health-related information, including symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments from social media; however, our approach can additionally provide actionable information to clinicians about the mental health of a patient in diagnostic terms for web-based intervention. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of the nature of subreddit content from domain expert's perspective and introduce a novel approach to map each subreddit to the best matching DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th Edition) category using multi-class classifier. Our classification algorithm analyzes all the posts of a subreddit by adapting topic modeling and word-embedding techniques, and utilizing curated medical knowledge bases to quantify relationship to DSM-5 categories.

Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. Conventional clinical practice uses TRUS to guide prostate biopsies when there is a suspicion of cancer. Pre-procedural MRI information can reveal lesions and may be fused with intra-procedure TRUS imaging to provide patient-specific, localization of lesions for targeting. The state-of-the-art MRI-TRUS nonrigid image fusion process relies upon semi-automated segmentation of the prostate in both the MRI and TRUS images. In this paper, we develop a fast, automated nonrigid registration approach to MRI-TRUS fusion based on a statistical deformation model of intra-procedural deformations derived from a clinical sample.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111206", "output": "Enhanced Airborne Relay-Based Positioning System with Adaptive Reference Station Measurements", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the ARPS has limitations, such as relatively large vertical error and service restrictions, because firstly, the user position is estimated based on airborne relays that are located in one direction, and secondly, the positioning is processed using only relayed navigation signals. In this paper, we propose an enhanced positioning algorithm to improve the performance of the ARPS. The main idea of the enhanced algorithm is the adaptable use of either virtual or direct measurements of reference stations in the calculation process based on the structural features of the ARPS. Unlike the existing two-step algorithm for airborne relay and user positioning, the enhanced algorithm is divided into two cases based on whether the required number of navigation signals for user positioning is met. In the first case, where the number of signals is greater than four, the user first estimates the positions of the airborne relays and its own initial position. Then, the user position is re-estimated by integrating a virtual measurement of a reference station that is calculated using the initial estimated user position and known reference positions. To prevent performance degradation, the re-estimation is performed after determining its requirement through comparing the expected position errors. If the navigation signals are insufficient, such as when the user is outside of airborne relay coverage, the user position is estimated by additionally using direct signal measurements of the reference stations in place of absent relayed signals. The simulation results demonstrate that a higher accuracy level can be achieved because the user position is estimated based on the measurements of airborne relays and a ground station. Furthermore, the service coverage is expanded by using direct measurements of reference stations for user positioning.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "1111207", "output": "\"Graph-Based Question Answering over Knowledge Bases and Entity-Linked Text: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Approach\"\n\nor alternatively\n\n\"RAFT-Net: A Graph Representation Learning Model for End-to-End Question Answering over Knowledge Bases and Text\"\n\nor alternatively\n\n\"Combining Knowledge Bases and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Specialized neural models have been developed for extracting answers from either text alone or Knowledge Bases (KBs) alone. In this paper we look at a more practical setting, namely QA over the combination of a KB and entity-linked text, which is appropriate when an incomplete KB is available with a large text corpus. Building on recent advances in graph representation learning we propose a novel model, GRAFT-Net, for extracting answers from a question-specific subgraph containing text and KB entities and relations. We construct a suite of benchmark tasks for this problem, varying the difficulty of questions, the amount of training data, and KB completeness. We show that GRAFT-Net is competitive with the state-of-the-art when tested using either KBs or text alone, and vastly outperforms existing methods in the combined setting.

Most existing works assumed that the central parameter server (PS) determines the participation of clients implying that clients cannot make autonomous participation decisions. The above assumption is unrealistic because the participation in FL training may incur various cost and clients also have strong desire to be rewarded for participation. To address this problem, we design a novel autonomous client participation scheme to incentivize clients. Specifically, the PS provides a certain reward shared among participating clients for each training round. Clients decide whether to participate each FL training round or not based on their own utilities (i.e., reward minus cost). The process can be modeled as a minority game (MG) with incomplete information and clients end up in the minority side win after each training round because the reward of each participating client may not cover its cost if too many clients participate and vice verse. The challenge of autonomous participation schemes lies in lowering the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">volatility</i>\n of participating clients in each round due to the lack of coordination among clients. Through solid analysis, we prove that: 1) The volatility of participating clients in each round is very high under the standard MG scheme. 2) The volatility of participating clients can be reduced significantly under the stochastic MG scheme. 3) A coalition based MG is proposed, which can further reduce the volatility in each round.

Security is built into NDN by embedding a public key signature in each data packet to enable verification of authenticity and integrity of the content. However, existing heavyweight signature generation and verification algorithms prevent universal integrity verification among NDN nodes, which may result in content pollution and denial of service attacks. Furthermore, caching and location-independent content access disables the capability of a content provider to control content access, e.g., who can cache a content and which end user or device can access it. We propose a lightweight integrity verification (LIVE) architecture, an extension to the NDN protocol, to address these two issues seamlessly. LIVE enables universal content signature verification in NDN with lightweight signature generation and verification algorithms. Furthermore, it allows a content provider to control content access in NDN nodes by selectively distributing integrity verification tokens to authorized nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of LIVE with open source CCNx project. Our paper shows that LIVE only incurs average 10% delay in accessing contents. Compared with traditional public key signature schemes, the verification delay is reduced by over 20 times in LIVE.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111210", "output": "Adaptive Projection Augmented Reality (AR) for Real-Time Object Recognition and Interactive User Interface Generation in 360-Degree Space", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the IoT ecosystem faces some great challenges in terms of security, such as privacy leaking, eavesdropping, and so on, which seriously impede the deployment of the IoT ecosystem. Verifiable searchable encryption (SE) can make data owners (DOs) in the IoT dispel concerns about privacy and make data users (DUs) believe they get correct search results. For the blockchain-enabled IoT, this article proposes an efficient verification SE scheme with aggregation authorization and trusted revocation. With this scheme, DOs are willing to share their data to DUs for reward in a secure, efficient, and trusted way. For the DU, the DO can generate an aggregating key of a subset of encrypted documents, and then the DU has the privilege to search these documents and to verify the search results. By utilizing the trusted execution environment, the DO can revoke the search privilege of the DU. We present the analysis to show our proposed scheme achieves confidentiality, soundness, and fair payment at the same time. With the performance evaluations, we prove our proposal practical for blockchain-enabled IoT in terms of computational and smart contracts overhead.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "1111212", "output": "Information Problem Solving Skills in Online Training: Can Video-Based Modelling Examples Enhance Performance?", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

They show deficiencies in many of the necessary skills, such as generation of search terms, selection of sources, and critical processing of information. It is therefore necessary to design and develop effective instruction to foster information problem solving skills. Research shows that learning from examples can be an effective approach for teaching complex cognitive skills in ill-structured domains, such as writing or communicating. To explore whether this also holds for information problem solving, this study investigates the effects of presenting a modelling example in an online information problem solving training. Results of two experiments show that viewing a modelling example, presented as a screencast of an expert thinking out loud and interspersed with cognitive prompts, leads to a higher posttest performance than performing a practice task. The effect persisted on a delayed posttest 1 week later. The results imply that information problem solving instruction in an online setting can benefit from employing video-based modelling examples.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111213", "output": "\"Integrating Simulation Experimentation and Documentation with SESSL for Complex Systems Biology Modeling in ML-Rules\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The development of such simulation models involves a wide variety of simulation experiments and the replicability of generated simulation results requires suitable means for documenting simulation experiments. Embedded domain-specific languages, such as SESSL, cater to both requirements. With SESSL, the user can integrate diverse simulation experimentation methods and third-party software components into an executable, readable simulation experiment specification. A newly developed SESSL binding for ML-Rules exploits these features of SESSL, opening up new possibilities for executing and documenting simulation experiments with ML-Rules models.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "1111214", "output": "Adaptive Control for Robust and Cost-Effective Web Applications: A Multi-Input, Multi-Output Model Identification Adaptive Controller Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Robustness is a crucial component of adaptability and it refers to the ability of the systems to deal with uncertainty, i.e. perturbations or unmodelled system dynamics that can affect the quality of the adaptation. Cost is another important property to ensure that resources are used prudently and frugally, whenever possible. Engineering robust and cost-effective adaptive systems can be accomplished using a control theory approach. In this paper, we show how to implement a model identification adaptive controller (MIAC) using a combination of performance and control models and how such a system satisfies the goals for robustness and cost-effectiveness. The controller we employ is multi-input, meaning that it can issue a variety of commands to adapt the system and multi-output, meaning it can regulate multiple performance indicators simultaneously. We show that such a solution can account for uncertainty and modelling errors and efficiently adapt a web application with multiple tiers of functionality spanning multiple layers of deployment, software and virtual machines, on Amazon EC2, an actual cloud environment.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "1111215", "output": "\"Efficient I/O Management for Scalable Cluster Systems: A Framework for Predictive and Adaptive Process Management\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A variety of different types of signals can be used by machines to represent and characterize actions such as RGB videos, infrared maps, and optical flow. In particular, skeleton sequences provide a natural 3D kinematic description of human motions and can be acquired in real time using RGB+D cameras. Moreover, skeleton sequences can be generalized to characterize the motions of both humans and humanoid robots. The Globally Optimal Reparameterization Algorithm (GORA) is a novel, recently proposed algorithm for signal alignment in which signals are reparameterized to a globally optimal universal standard timescale (UST). Here, we introduce a variant of GORA for humanoid action recognition with skeleton sequences, which we call GORA-S. We briefly review the algorithm's mathematical foundations and contextualize them in the problem of action recognition with skeleton sequences. Subsequently, we introduce GORA-S and discuss parameters and numerical techniques for its effective implementation. We then compare its performance with that of the DTW and FastDTW algorithms, in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy in matching skeletons. Our results show that GORA-S attains a complexity that is significantly less than that of any tested DTW method. In addition, it displays a favorable balance between speed and accuracy that remains invariant under changes in skeleton sampling frequency, lending it a degree of versatility that could make it well-suited for a variety of action recognition tasks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111217", "output": "Operational Transconductance Amplifier with Adaptive Common-Mode Voltage Regulation for Low-Voltage Applications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we develop a novel design of DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture which achieves lower cycles in every basic operation than prior arts. Our small yet fast in-memory computing units support basic logic operations including NOT, AND, and OR. Using those operations, along with shift and propagation, bitwise operations can be extended to word-wise operations, e.g. increment and comparison, with high efficiency. We also optimize the designs to exploit parallelism and data reuse to further improve the performance of compound operations. Compared with the most powerful state-of-the-art PIM architecture, we can achieve comparable or even better performance while consuming only 6% of its area overhead.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "1111220", "output": "Temperature-Aware Application Mapping for Mitigating On-Chip Hotspots and Network Latency", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, very few works have explored effective ways of making tradeoff between temperature and network latency. Moreover, on-chip routers, which are of high power density and may lead to hotspots, are not considered in these works. In this paper, we propose TAPP (Temperature-Aware Partitioning and Placement), an efficient application mapping algorithm to reduce on-chip hotspots while sacrificing little network performance. This algorithm \u201cspreads\u201d high-power cores and routers across the chip by performing hierarchical bi-partitioning of the cores and concurrently conducting placement of the cores onto tiles, and achieves high efficiency and superior scalability. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the temperature by up to 6.80\u00b0C with minimal latency increase compared to the latency-oriented mapping solution.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "1111221", "output": "Designing a Trust-Based Financial Application for Small Merchants in Northeast Brazil: A Study of the Fiado Practice", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It combines the strengths of Recurrent Kernel Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine with a new modified Drift Detector Mechanism (DDM) and Approximate Linear Dependency Kernel Filter (ALD) in solving concept drift problems and reducing complex computations in the learning. The recursive kernel method successfully replaces the normal kernel method in Recurrent Kernel Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine with DDM (RKOS-ELM-DDM) and generates a fixed reservoir with optimized information in enhancing the forecasting performance. Meta-cognitive learning strategy decides when the incoming data needs to be updated, retrained, or discarded during learning and automatically finding ALD threshold that reduces the learning time of prediction model. In the experiment, six synthetic and three real-world time series datasets are used to evaluate the ability of recursive kernel method, the performance of concept drift detectors, and meta-cognitive learning strategy in time series prediction. Experimental results indicate the meta-RRKOS-ELM with DDM has superior prediction ability in the different predicting horizons as compared with other algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.65}, {"id": "1111223", "output": "\"Emotion Detection in Code-Switching Text: A Shared Task Overview\"\n\nor\n\n\"Code-Switching Emotion Detection: Challenges and Evaluation Results\"\n\nor\n\n\"Integrating Monolingual and Bilingual Forms for Emotion Detection in Code-Switching Text\"\n\nor\n\n\"Bridging Language Gaps", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, node similarity between nodes in different graphs (inter graph nodes) has not received enough attention yet. The inter-graph node similarity is important in learning a new graph based on the knowledge extracted from an existing graph (transfer learning on graphs) and has applications in biological, communication, and social networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distance function for measuring inter-graph node similarity with edit distance, called NED. In NED, two nodes are compared according to their local neighborhood topologies which are represented as unordered k-adjacent trees, without relying on any extra information. Due to the hardness of computing tree edit distance on unordered trees which is NP-Complete, we propose a modified tree edit distance, called TED*, for comparing unordered and unlabeled k-adjacent trees. TED* is a metric distance, as the original tree edit distance, but more importantly, TED* is polynomially computable. As a metric distance, NED admits efficient indexing, provides interpretable results, and shows to perform better than existing approaches on a number of data analysis tasks, including graph deanonymization. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of NED are empirically demonstrated using real-world graphs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "1111226", "output": "\"Efficient Rule Compression for Heterogeneous SDN Devices: A Semantics-Based Approach to Minimizing Network Policy Entries\"\n\nor\n\n\"Minimizing Network Policy Entries in SDN using Rule Compression: A Compiler-Based Approach for Heterogeneous Devices\"\n\nor\n\n\"Reducing Resource Consumption and Lookup Time in SD", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Rules are deployed as sets of entries into the tables of network devices. Deploying them onto heterogeneous set of devices is strongly bounded by the respective table constraints (size, lookup time, etc.) and forwarding pipelines. Hence, it is important to minimize the overall number of entries in order to both reduce resource consumption and speed up the search. In this work, we present a compression mechanism for rules of diverging origins that minimizes the number of entries. Since it exploits the semantics of rules and entries, our compiler fits a heterogeneous landscape of network devices. We evaluated implementations of our compiler for both software and hardware switches on a realistic test bed.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111227", "output": "Pyramid-Based Scatterplot Sampling for Progressive Visualization of Large Datasets\n\nor\n\nProgressive Visualization of High-Dimensional Data using Pyramid-Based Scatterplot Sampling\n\nor\n\nScatterplot Sampling with Multiresolution Pyramid Decomposition for Streaming Visualization of Large Data", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Decision trees are extremely fast, highly accurate and easy to use in practice. Merging multiple decision trees to an ensemble leads to one of the most powerful machine learning methods. The Very Fast Decision Tree is the state-of-the-art incremental decision tree induction algorithm, capable of learning from massive data streams. It is successful due to its theoretical guarantees based on the Hoeffding bound as well as its competitive performance in terms of classification accuracy and time / space efficiency. In this paper, we increase the efficiency even further by replacing its global splitting scheme, which periodically tries to split every n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</sub>\n examples. Instead, we utilize local statistics to predict the split-time, thus, avoiding unnecessary split-attempts, usually dominating the computational cost. Concretely, we use the class distributions of previous split-attempts to approximate the minimum number of examples until the Hoeffding bound is met. This cautious approach yields by design a low delay and reduces the number of split-attempts at the same time. We extensively evaluate our method using common stream-learning benchmarks also considering non-stationary environments. The experiments confirm a substantially reduced run-time without a loss in classification performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "1111229", "output": "Temporal Synchronization of Motion Capture and Video in Simplified Taiji Quan: A Novel Algorithm for Cross-Subject Comparison.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

With only prior knowledge that the subjects in video and mocap perform a similar pose sequence, we establish inter-subject temporal synchronization and spatial alignment of mocap and video based on body joint correspondences. Through time alignment and matching the viewpoint and orientation of the video camera, the 3D body joints from mocap data of subject A can be correctly projected onto the video performance of subject B. Initial quantitative evaluation of this alignment method shows promise in offering the first validated algorithmic treatment for cross-subject comparison of Taiji Quan performances. This work opens the door to subject-specific quantified comparison of long motion sequences beyond Taiji.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111230", "output": "\"Grammatical and Parametric Secret Sharing: Enhancing Secure Information Division in Distributed Environments\"\n\nor\n\n\"Grammar-Based and Behavioral Secret Sharing: A Novel Approach for Secure Data Management in Cloud and Distributed Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"Parametric and Grammatical Cryptographic Secret Sharing: Exploring New Paradigms for", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Critical links are such links that their deletion exerts substantial effects on the network performance such as the average node reachability. We tackle this problem by proposing a new method which consists of three acceleration techniques: redundant-link skipping (RLS), marginal-node pruning (MNP) and burn-out following (BOF). All of them are designed to avoid unnecessary computation and work both in combination and in isolation. We tested the effectiveness of the proposed method using two real-world large networks and two synthetic large networks. In particular, we showed that the proposed method can estimate the performance degradation by link removal without introducing any approximation within a computation time comparable to that needed by the bottom-k sketch which is a summary of dataset and can efficiently process approximate queries, i.e., reachable nodes, on the original dataset, i.e., the given network. Further, we confirmed that the measures easily composed by the well known existing centralities, e.g. in/out-degree, betweenness, PageRank, authority/hub, are not able to detect critical links. Links detected by these measures do not reduce the average reachability at all, i.e., not critical at all.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111232", "output": "\"Novel 3D Deep Learning Architectures for Brain MRI Segmentation with Randomized Connections and Hybrid Convolutional Units\"\n\nor \n\"Deep Learning for Brain MRI Segmentation: A Novel 3D Network with Randomized Connections and Combined Convolutional-Long Short-Term Memory Units\"\n\nor \n\"Hy", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, such a traditional test method may not be adequate for 3D-ICs, in which die-to-die interconnects could operate at a very high speed with an end-to-end delay of only a few hundred of picoseconds. Parametric defects (such as small delay faults, resistive open/bridging faults, leakage faults, etc.) have been identified as new threats to the quality, yield, and reliability of a 3D-IC. In response to this challenge, numerous test methods have been developed. In this chapter, we will first discuss common defect types occurring to die-to-die interconnects, and then review various interconnect test methods applicable during the pre-bond stage and the post-bond stage.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111234", "output": "Weighted Chebyshev Polynomial Approximation for Efficient Support Size Estimation in Unknown Distributions", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our main contributions include describing a rigorous new weighted Chebyshev polynomial approximation method and introducing regularization terms into the problem formulation that provably improve the performance of state-of-the-art approximation-based approaches. In particular, we present both theoretical and computer simulation results that illustrate the utility and performance improvements of our method. The theoretical analysis relies on jointly optimizing the bias and variance components of the risk, and combining new weighted minmax polynomial approximation techniques with discretized semi-infinite programming solvers. Such a setting allows for casting the estimation problem as a linear program (LP) with a small number of variables and constraints that may be solved as efficiently as the original Chebyshev approximation-based problem. The described approach also applies to the support coverage and entropy estimation problems. Our newly developed technique is tested on synthetic data and used to estimate the number of bacterial species in the human gut. On synthetic datasets, we observed up to five-fold improvements in the value of the worst-case risk. For the bioinformatics application, metagenomic data from the NIH Human Gut and the American Gut Microbiome was combined and processed to obtain lists of bacterial taxonomies. These were subsequently used to compute the bacterial species histograms and estimate the number of bacterial species in the human gut to roughly 2350, with the species being represented by trillions of cells.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111235", "output": "\"Compressing State-of-the-Art Language Models via Parameter Sharing: A Simple yet Effective Approach to Reduce Model Size\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Typically, this task is approached by deformable registration of successive images followed by the analysis of the resulting deformation field(s). Most registration methods require prior knowledge in the form of regularization of the image transformation which is often sensitive to tuneable parameters. Alternatively, we present a registration approach which learns a low-dimensional stochastic parametrization of the deformation -- unsupervised, by looking at images. Hereby, spatial regularization is replaced by a constraint on this parameter space to follow a prescribed probabilistic distribution, by using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). This leads to a generative model designed to be structured and more anatomy-invariant which makes the deformation encoding potentially useful for analysis tasks like the transport of deformations. We also constrain the deformations to be diffeomorphic using a new differentiable exponentiation layer. We used data sets of 330 cardiac and 1000 brain images and demonstrate accurate registration results comparable to two state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we evaluate the learned deformation encoding in two preliminary experiments: 1) We illustrate the modelu0027s anatomy-invariance by transporting the encoded deformations from one subject to another. 2) We evaluate the structure of the encoding space by clustering diseases.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111237", "output": "Optimization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Aided AirComp Systems: Joint Trajectory Design and Power Allocation for Enhanced Performance", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The trajectory design of the UAV provides an additional degree of freedom to improve the performance of AirComp. We aim to minimize the time-averaged mean-squared error (MSE) of AirComp by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, receive normalizing factors, and sensors\u2019 transmit power. To this end, we first propose a novel and equivalent problem transformation by introducing intermediate variables. This reformulation leads to a convex subproblem when fixing any other two blocks of variables, thereby enabling efficient algorithm design based on the principle of block coordinate descent and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) techniques. In particular, we derive the optimal closed-form solutions for normalizing factors and intermediate variables optimization subproblems. We also recast the convex trajectory design subproblem into an ADMM form and obtain the closed-form expressions for each variable updating. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a smaller time-averaged MSE while reducing the simulation time by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "1111238", "output": "Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization in the Discrete Periodic Radom Transform Domain for Effective Image Denoising of Edges with Prominent Singularities", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While the traditional patch-based low rank minimization approach, such as WNNM, has shown highly competitive image denoising performance, they treat all image patch groups with the same strategy hence cannot be optimum since image patches can have different properties. Particularly for patches with sharp edges, they need to be carefully handled as any error in their denoising can lead to significant degradation to the visual quality of the image. For effective denoising of natural lines/edges with prominent singularities, we apply the WNNM operator in the DPRT domain which allows the edges of different orientations to be effectively represented by different DPRT projections. The proposed algorithm first identifies the image patches with strong edges in the DPRT domain. Then, the new DPRT based WNNM operator is applied for their denoising. For the smooth patches, the conventional WNNM operator is performed in the spatial domain. Simulation results unto the various testing images show that the proposed approach achieves a substantial improvement in terms of both peak signal-to-noise (PSNR) ratio and in visual quality as compared with other state-of-the-art image denoising approaches.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "1111239", "output": "\"Enhancing Superpixel Discriminative Ability through Covariance Descriptors: Log-Euclidean Distance and Low-Rank Representation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Superpixel Segmentation via Covariance Descriptors: A Comparative Study of Log-Euclidean Distance and Low-Rank Representation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Covariance Descriptor-based Superpixel Seg", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The major shortcoming of the commonly used stemmers is that they accept the morphological variants of the query words without considering their thematic coherence with the given query, which leads to poor performance. Moreover, for many queries, such approaches also produce retrieval performance that is poorer than no stemming, thereby degrading the robustness. The main goal of this article is to present corpus-based fully automatic stemming algorithms which address these issues. A set of experiments on six TREC collections and three other non-English collections containing news and web documents shows that the proposed query-based stemming algorithms consistently and significantly outperform four state of the art strong stemmers of completely varying principles. Our experiments also confirm that the robustness of the proposed query-based stemming algorithms are remarkably better than the existing strong baselines.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111243", "output": "\"Reconciling Declarativity and Parallelism: A Quotation-Based EDSL for Distributed Data Analysis\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A characteristic of these systems is a scalable programming model based on distributed collections and parallel transformations expressed by means of second-order functions such as map and reduce. Notable examples are Flink\u2019s DataSet and Spark\u2019s RDD programming abstractions. These programming models are realized as EDSLs\u2014domain specific languages embedded in a general-purpose host language such as Java, Scala, or Python. This approach has several advantages over traditional external DSLs such as SQL or XQuery. First, syntactic constructs from the host language (e.g., anonymous functions syntax, value definitions, and fluent syntax via method chaining) can be reused in the EDSL. This eases the learning curve for developers already familiar with the host language. Second, it allows for seamless integration of library methods written in the host language via the function parameters passed to the parallel dataflow operators. This reduces the effort for developing analytics dataflows that go beyond pure SQL and require domain-specific logic.\n\nAt the same time, however, state-of-the-art parallel dataflow EDSLs exhibit a number of shortcomings. First, one of the main advantages of an external DSL such as SQL\u2014the high-level, declarative Select-From-Where syntax\u2014is either lost completely or mimicked in a non-standard way. Second, execution aspects such as caching, join order, and partial aggregation have to be decided by the programmer. Optimizing them automatically is very difficult due to the limited program context available in the intermediate representation of the DSL.\n\nIn this article, we argue that the limitations listed above are a side effect of the adopted type-based embedding approach. As a solution, we propose an alternative EDSL design based on quotations. We present a DSL embedded in Scala and discuss its compiler pipeline, intermediate representation, and some of the enabled optimizations. We promote the algebraic type of bags in union representation as a model for distributed collections and its associated structural recursion scheme and monad as a model for parallel collection processing. At the source code level, Scala\u2019s comprehension syntax over a bag monad can be used to encode Select-From-Where expressions in a standard way. At the intermediate representation level, maintaining comprehensions as a first-class citizen can be used to simplify the design and implementation of holistic dataflow optimizations that accommodate for nesting and control-flow. The proposed DSL design therefore reconciles the benefits of embedded parallel dataflow DSLs with the declarativity and optimization potential of external DSLs like SQL.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111244", "output": "Based on the provided features, I can generate a title that reflects the style of the abstract.\n\nSince I have received the similar abstract-title pairs from my past works, I can infer that I tend to use phrases that emphasize the novelty and significance of the research.

In this paper, we introduce simplicial patterns \u2014that we call simplets\u2014 and generalize the task of frequent pattern mining from the realm of graphs to that of simplicial complexes. Our task is particularly challenging due to the enormous search space and the need for higher-order isomorphism. We show that finding the occurrences of simplets in a complex can be reduced to a bipartite graph isomorphism problem, in linear time and at most quadratic space. We then propose an anti-monotonic frequency measure that allows us to start the exploration from small simplets and stop expanding a simplet as soon as its frequency falls below the minimum frequency threshold. Equipped with these ideas and a clever data structure, we develop a memory-conscious algorithm that, by carefully exploiting the relationships among the simplices in the complex and among the simplets, achieves efficiency and scalability for our complex mining task. Our algorithm, FreSCo, comes in two flavors: it can compute the exact frequency of the simplets or, more quickly, it can determine whether a simplet is frequent, without having to compute the exact frequency. Experimental results prove the ability of FreSCo to mine frequent simplets in complexes of various size and dimension, and the significance of the simplets with respect to the traditional graph patterns.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111245", "output": "\"Evaluating the CL-SciSumm Framework: A Multi-Faceted Approach to Information Retrieval and Summarization\"\n\nor\n\n\"Addressing the CL-SciSumm Challenges: A Comprehensive Analysis of Reference Span Extraction, Facet Identification, and Summary Generation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Overcoming the CL-Sci", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, although these heterogeneous computing platforms are becoming widely available, they are very difficult to program especially with FPGAs. As a result, the use of such platforms has been limited to a small subset of programmers with specialized hardware knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we introduce HeteroCL, a programming infrastructure composed of a Python-based domain-specific language (DSL) and an FPGA-targeted compilation flow. The HeteroCL DSL provides a clean programming abstraction that decouples algorithm specification from three important types of hardware customization in compute, data types, and memory architectures. HeteroCL further captures the interdependence among these different customization techniques, allowing programmers to explore various performance/area/accuracy trade-offs in a systematic and productive manner. In addition, our framework produces highly efficient hardware implementations for a variety of popular workloads by targeting spatial architecture templates such as systolic arrays and stencil with dataflow architectures. Experimental results show that HeteroCL allows programmers to explore the design space efficiently in both performance and accuracy by combining different types of hardware customization and targeting spatial architectures, while keeping the algorithm code intact.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.99}, {"id": "1111247", "output": "Automated Detection of Human Papillomavirus-Infected Cells in Cervical Smears: A Comparative Study of Thresholding Methods and Segmentation Techniques", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The established PAP smear achieves a sensitivity of 50-90%, most false negative results are caused by mistakes in the preparation of the specimen or reader variability in the subjective, visual investigation. Since cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), the detection of HPV-infected cells opens new perspectives for screening of precancerous abnormalities. Immunocytochemical preparation marks HPV-positive cells in brush smears of the cervix with high sensitivity and specificity. The goal of this work is the automated detection of all marker-positive cells in microscopic images of a sample slide stained with an immunocytochemical marker. A color separation technique is used to estimate the concentrations of the immunocytochemical marker stain as well as of the counterstain used to color the nuclei. Segmentation methods based on Otsu's threshold selection method and Mean Shift are adapted to the task of segmenting marker-positive cells and their nuclei. The best detection performance of single marker-positive cells was achieved with the adapted thresholding method with a sensitivity of 95.9%. The contours differed by a modified Hausdorff Distance (MHD) of 2.8 mu m. Nuclei of single marker positive cells were detected with a sensitivity of 95.9% and MHD = 1.02 mu m.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.62}, {"id": "1111248", "output": "\"Robust Pricing Mechanisms in Large Markets: The Role of Idiosyncratic Taste Shocks and Extreme Value Theory\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We show that random utility models with idiosyncratic taste shocks driven by standard noise distributions produce, in large markets, robustly high equilibrium markups that are insensitive to the degree of competition. For example, with Gaussian noise and n firms, markups are asymptotically proportional to 1/ln\u2061n; consequently, a hundred-fold increase in n, from 10 to 1000 competing firms, only halves the equilibrium markup. The elasticity of the markup with respect to n asymptotically equals the distribution's tail exponent from extreme value theory. Only noise distributions with very thin tails have negative asymptotic markup elasticities.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.52}, {"id": "1111249", "output": "\"Standardizing Big Data: An Algorithmic Framework for Uniform Table Processing\"\n\nor\n\n\"Transforming Heterogeneous Tables: A Category Table Approach for End-to-End Processing\"\n\nor\n\n\"Unified Table Processing for Big Data Analytics: A Novel Algorithmic Solution\"\n\nor\n\n\"Header-Indexed Tables in a Category Framework", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For a meaningful role in Big Data analytics, the facts reported in these tables must be brought into a uniform framework. Based on a formalization of header-indexed tables, we proffer an algorithmic solution to end-to-end table processing for a large class of human-readable tables. The proposed algorithms transform header-indexed tables to a category table format that maps easily to a variety of industry-standard data stores for query processing. The algorithms segment table regions based on the unique indexing of the data region by header paths, classify table cells, and factor header category structures of two-dimensional as well as the less common multidimensional tables. Experimental evaluations substantiate the algorithmic approach to processing heterogeneous tables. As demonstrable results, the algorithms generate queryable relational database tables and semantic-web triple stores. Application of our algorithms to 400 web tables randomly selected from diverse sources shows that the algorithmic solution automates end-to-end table processing.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111250", "output": "Temporal Coincidence Analysis for Unsupervised Learning of Correspondence Relations from Extended Image Sequences", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We are specifically interested in learning the correspondence relations 'from scratch' and only consider the temporal signal of single pixels. We build on the Temporal Coincidence Analysis (TCA) approach which we apply to motion estimation. Experimental results showcase the approach for learning average motion maps and for the estimation of yaw rates in a visual odometry setting. Our approach is not meant as a direct competitor to state of the art dense motion algorithms but rather shows that valuable information for various vision tasks can be learnt by a simple statistical analysis on the pixel level. Primarily, the approach unveils principles on which biological or 'deep' learning techniques may build architectures for motion perception; so TCA formulates a hypothesis for a fundamental perception mechanism. Motion or correspondence distributions as they are determined here may associate conventional methods with a confidence measure, which allows to detect implausible, and thus probably incorrect correspondences. The approach does not need any kind of ground truth information, but rather learns over long image sequences and may thus be seen as a continuous learning method. The method is not restricted to a specific camera model and works even with strong geometric distortions. Results are presented for standard as well as fisheye cameras.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111251", "output": "\"Optimizing Government Services: A Cognitive Analytics Framework for Enhanced Efficiency and Shared Value Creation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Image-based rendering is conventionally used to showcase the increased capabilities of light field contents on traditional 2D screens. However, the range of possibilities for rendering parameters is virtually endless, which poses the problem of what rendered images should be used when performing visual quality assessments, as well as how to properly present them to subjects during quality evaluations. Single-image assessment has been used in the past to conduct subjective quality evaluations. Since this type of assessment generates a large number of stimuli to be evaluated, which increases the complexity, length, and cost of the test, it is fundamental to analyze whether the added strain on the evaluation procedure is compensated by statistically relevant results. In this paper, we analyze the results of a subjective evaluation campaign that used single-image assessment by means of statistical tools, to understand whether the advantages of evaluating light field contents through separately rendered images counterbalance the increase in complexity. In particular, we test whether different types of rendering lead to statistically different ratings, and if testing a variety of rendering parameters through single-image assessment is advisable. Results provide useful guidelines to designs more efficient subjective quality assessment for light field contents.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "1111253", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Reliable Control Packet Transmission for Remote Vehicles\", \"A Novel Approach to Enhance RCV Control\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- The abstract emphasizes the importance of reliable control packet transmission for remote vehicles, suggesting a", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Since RCVs, such as drones, have high mobility, it is important for operators to control RCVs reliably. Thus, to keep monitoring and controlling RCVs, operators continuously exchange control packets with RCVs by wireless. However, control packets can be delayed or lost due to any communication or network problems, which may cause collisions or crashes. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose DupCon, a new control packet transmission scheme. Considering characteristics of packets, DupCon duplicates only control packets, not data packets, and transmits the originals and their duplicates through different paths, respectively. We designed and implemented DupCon on real devices. Moreover, we conduct an analysis on DupCon to demonstrate the validity of DupCon theoretically. Furthermore, we conducted various experiments, and the results show that DupCon improves reliability and stability of real-time remote vehicle control.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111254", "output": "\"Optimizing Membership Query Performance for Large-Scale Scientific Data Using Bitmap Indexing and Parallelization Techniques\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Managing and analyzing massive quantities of scientific data is challenging as data are often stored in specific formatted files, such as HDF5 and NetCDF, which do not offer appropriate search capabilities. In this research, we investigated a special class of search capability, called membership query, to identify whether queried elements of a set are members of an attribute. Attributes that naturally have classification values appear frequently in scientific domains such as category and object type as well as in daily life such as zip code and occupation. Because classification attribute values are discrete and require random data access, performing a membership query on a large scientific data set creates challenges. We applied bitmap indexing and parallelization to membership queries to overcome these challenges. Bitmap indexing provides high performance not only for low cardinality attributes but also for high cardinality attributes, such as floating-point variables, electric charge, or momentum in a particle physics data set, due to compression algorithms such as Word-Aligned Hybrid. We conducted experiments, in a highly parallelized environment, on data obtained from a particle accelerator model and a synthetic data set.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "1111255", "output": "\"Introducing Scenario-Based Programming through Live Sequence Charts: A Pilot Course for High School Students\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although there are many outstanding solutions of geographic routing designed for the VANETs, only one or two features of the VANETs have been specifically utilized in each of the proposed solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive fuzzy multiple attribute decision routing (AFMADR) scheme, by which a packet carrier is supposed to be a decision maker in the selection of a target for the next hop transmission with more factors to be considered. The AFMADR scheme consists of four steps. Firstly, the candidate vehicles are characterized by four attributes including the distance, the direction, the road density, and the location to obtain a fuzzy attribute score of each attribute. Secondly, according to the real-time conditions of the candidates' attributes, weights of attributes will be calculated by the proposed adaptive weight algorithm, which makes the AFMADR scheme more scalable and robust in different VANET scenarios. Then, a fuzzy performance score will be produced for each candidate based on the fuzzy attribute score and their real-time weights. Lastly, a route decision is made by choosing a candidate with the highest performance score as the target for the next hop transmission. We carry out simulation experiments to compare the performance of the AFMADR scheme with the existing well-known geographic routing protocols for the VANETs. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AFMADR scheme can achieve the best performance in terms of the highest delivery ratio and the lowest delivery delay with a reasonable number of hops among all protocols in all the simulation scenarios.

These accounts are often wildly optimistic, understating outstanding challenges while turning a blind eye to the human labor that undergirds and sustains ostensibly \"automated\" services. This long-standing focus on purely automated methods unnecessarily cedes a promising design space: one in which computational assistance augments and enriches, rather than replaces, people's intellectual work. This tension between human agency and machine automation poses vital challenges for design and engineering. In this work, we consider the design of systems that enable rich, adaptive interaction between people and algorithms. We seek to balance the often-complementary strengths and weaknesses of each, while promoting human control and skillful action. We share case studies of interactive systems we have developed in three arenasdata wrangling, exploratory analysis, and natural language translation-that integrate proactive computational support into interactive systems. To improve outcomes and support learning by both people and machines, we describe the use of shared representations of tasks augmented with predictive models of human capabilities and actions. We conclude with a discussion of future prospects and scientific frontiers for intelligence augmentation research.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.0}, {"id": "1111258", "output": "\"Identifying Functional Clones in Object-Oriented Languages through In-Vivo Analysis and Comparison of Inputs and Outputs\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While most approaches focus on identifying code that looks alike, some techniques aim at detecting code that functions alike. Detecting these functional clones \u2014 code that functions alike \u2014 in object oriented languages remains an open question because of the difficulty in exposing and comparing programs' functionality effectively. We propose a novel technique, In-Vivo Clone Detection, that detects functional clones in arbitrary programs by identifying and mining their inputs and outputs. The key insight is to use existing workloads to execute programs and then measure functional similarities between programs based on their inputs and outputs, which mitigates the problems in object oriented languages reported by prior work. We implement such technique in our system, HitoshiIO, which is open source and freely available. Our experimental results show that HitoshiIO detects more than 800 functional clones across a corpus of 118 projects. In a random sample of the detected clones, HitoshiIO achieves 68+% true positive rate with only 15% false positive rate.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111259", "output": "Weight-Shared Multi-Stage Networks for Robust Image Classification Against Scaling Transformations\n\n<similarpairs>\n[Pair 1: \"Deep CNNs for Image Classification\", \"Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition\"]\n[Pair 2: \"Robust CNNs for Image Classification\", \"Improving CNN Performance with", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The CNNs with deeper architectures have achieved higher performances recently thanks to their robustness to parallel shift of objects in images aw well as their numerous parameters and resulting high expression ability. However, the CNNs have a limited robustness to other geometric transformations such as scaling and rotation. This problem is considered to limit performance improvement of the deep CNNs but there is no established solution. This study focuses on scale transformation and proposes a novel network architecture called weight-shared multi-stage network (WSMS-Net), consisting of multiple stages of CNNs. The WSMS-Net is easily combined with existing deep CNNs, such as ResNet and DenseNet, and enables them to acquire a robustness to scaling of objects. The experimental results demonstrate that existing deep CNNs combined with the proposed WSMS-Net achieve higher accuracy for image classification tasks only with a little increase in the number of parameters.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111260", "output": "Predicting Stability in Multibit Delta-Sigma Modulators Using Modified Nonlinearity in Control Theory\n\n<similarpairs>\nPredicting Stability in Multibit Delta-Sigma Modulators\nPredicting Stability in Sigma-Delta Modulators\nAnalytical Modeling of Multibit Delta-Sigma Modulators\nStability Prediction", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In addition to being more scalable and non-volatile, ReRAM also has the capability of performing logic functions. In this paper, we aim to investigate using 3D stacked ReRAM to achieve a scalable and high-performance memory system architecture. 3D integration of ReRAM crossbar layers (i.e., 3D crossbar) is a potential method for further improving ReRAM density. However, 3D architectures typically suffer from high operating temperatures, which adversely impact ReRAM reliability and device performance. The objective of this study is to address ReRAM endurance limitations, which is a major drawback for such resistive memory technologies. Specifically, we analyze the impact of temperature on ReRAM endurance in 3D and 2.5D stacking designs and show that stacking ReRAM onto multicore dies (i.e., 3D stacking design) may cause lifetime concerns. We then propose a novel solution to improve the access efficiency and reduce the number of accesses to the overheated ReRAM banks. The goal of our mechanism which is mainly utilized for the 2.5D design, is to perform slower and fewer accesses to hot banks to cool them. Evaluation results show that our technique called THOR, can achieve 2.06\u00d7 lifetime enhancement and 7.5\u00b0C peak temperature reduction over a baseline design with only 1.9% performance degradation while running on the 2.5D design.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111262", "output": "Mixed-Criticality Scheduling: A Comparative Analysis of Two Algorithms for Real-Time Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Scheduling of such systems is a popular topic in literature due to the complexity and importance of the problem. In this paper we propose two algorithms for job scheduling in mixed critical systems: mixed criticality earliest deadline first (MCEDF) and mixed critical priority improvement (MCPI). MCEDF is a single processor algorithm that theoretically dominates state-of-the-art fixed-priority algorithm own criticality based priority (OCBP), while having a better computational complexity. The dominance is achieved by profiting from a common extension of fixed-priority online policy to mixed criticality. MCPI is a multiprocessor algorithm that supports dependency constraints. Experiments show good schedulability results. Also we formally prove that both MCEDF and MCPI are optimal in a particular class of algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "1111263", "output": "Optimizing Route Planning Queries: A Novel Approach for Efficient Spatial Keyword Search on Road Networks", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Because of this reason, many new queries on spatial objects affiliated with textual information, known as the Spatial Keyword Queries, have taken significant research interest in the past years. Unfortunately, most of existing works on Spatial Keyword Queries only focus on objects retrieval. There is barely any work on route planning queries, even though route planning is often needed in our daily life. In this research, we propose the Best Path Query, which we find the best optimum route from two different spatial locations that visits or avoids the objects that are specified by the textual data given by the user. We show that Best Path Query is an NP-Hard problem. We propose an efficient indexing technique, namely IG-Tree, and three different algorithms with different trade-offs to process the Best Path Queries on Road Networks. Our extensive experimental study demonstrates the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed approach.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "1111264", "output": "Clustering Large-Scale System Instances with 1D-CAE and Efficient Feature Selection for Reduced Anomaly Detection Overhead", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the vast number of system instances with massive time points, redundant metrics, and noise bring significant challenges. We propose OmniCluster to accurately and efficiently cluster system instances for large-scale Web services. It combines a one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder (1D-CAE), which extracts the main features of system instances, with a simple, novel, yet effective three-step feature selection strategy. We evaluated OmniCluster using real-world data collected from a top-tier content service provider providing services for one billion+ monthly active users (MAU), proving that OmniCluster achieves high accuracy (NMI=0.9160) and reduces the training overhead of five anomaly detection models by 95.01% on average.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111265", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\nFair View Graph Neural Network (FairVGNN)\nFair Graph Neural Network with Feature Masking\nFair Graph Neural Networks with Correlation-Aware Fairness\nFairness in Graph Neural Networks with Feature Propagation\n</similarpairs", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, they may inherit historical prejudices from training data, leading to discriminatory bias in predictions. Although some work has developed fair GNNs, most of them directly borrow fair representation learning techniques from non-graph domains without considering the potential problem of sensitive attribute leakage caused by feature propagation in GNNs. However, we empirically observe that feature propagation could vary the correlation of previously innocuous non-sensitive features to the sensitive ones. This can be viewed as a leakage of sensitive information which could further exacerbate discrimination in predictions. Thus, we design two feature masking strategies according to feature correlations to highlight the importance of considering feature propagation and correlation variation in alleviating discrimination. Motivated by our analysis, we propose Fair View Graph Neural Network (FairVGNN) to generate fair views of features by automatically identifying and masking sensitive-correlated features considering correlation variation after feature propagation. Given the learned fair views, we adaptively clamp weights of the encoder to avoid using sensitive-related features. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FairVGNN enjoys a better trade-off between model utility and fairness.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111266", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\nUsing the <similarpairs> feature, I found similar abstract title pairs from my past works:\n\n1. \"Graph-Based Framework for Event Detection in Social Media\"\n2. \"Network-Driven Approach for Identifying Protest Events\"\n\nUsing the <features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Existing research has presented myriad approaches relying on tweet corpus to solve the event detection problem, with notable improvements over time. Despite the plethora of research on event detection, the use of the implicit social links among users in online communities for event detection is rarely observed. In this work, we propose SensorTree, a novel event detection framework that utilizes the network structural connections among users in a community for protest event detection. SensorTree tracks information propagating among communities of Twitter users as propagation trees to detect bursts based on the sudden changes in size of these communities. Once a burst is identified, SensorTree uses a latent event topic model to extract topics from the corpus over the burst period to describe the event that triggered the burst. Extensive experiments performed on real-world Twitter datasets using qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superiority of SensorTree over existing state-of-the-art methods. We present case studies to further show that SensorTree detects events with fine granularity descriptions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111267", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generated a potential title:\n\n\"Probabilistic Modeling of User-Defined Pairwise Relations for Semi-Supervised Clustering\"\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\"Generative Framework for Informed Unsupervised Clustering via Pairwise Relations\"\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\"Probabilistic Clustering with User-Defined Constraints", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Constrained clustering, as a subclass of SSL, makes use of user input in the form of relationships between data points (e.g., pairs of data points belonging to the same class or different classes) and can remarkably improve the performance of unsupervised clustering in order to reflect user-defined knowledge of the relationships between particular data points. Existing algorithms incorporate such user input, heuristically, as either hard constraints or soft penalties, which are separate from any generative or statistical aspect of the clustering model; this results in formulations that are suboptimal and not sufficiently general. In this paper, we propose a principled, generative approach to probabilistically model, without ad hoc penalties, the joint distribution given by user-defined pairwise relations. The proposed model accounts for general underlying distributions without assuming a specific form and relies on expectation-maximization for model fitting. For distributions in a standard form, the proposed approach results in a closed-form solution for updated parameters.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111268", "output": "\"Real-Time Point Cloud Tracking with High Accuracy and Low Latency via Human-Tracking Assisted ToF Cameras\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The finding of the suitable parameters of an evolutionary algorithm, as the Bumble Bees Mating Optimization (BBMO) algorithm, is one of the most challenging tasks that a researcher has to deal with. One of the most common used ways to solve the problem is the trial and error procedure. In the recent few years, a number of adaptive versions of every evolutionary and nature inspired algorithm have been presented in order to avoid the use of a predefined set of parameters for all instances of the studied problem. In this paper, an adaptive version of the BBMO algorithm is proposed, where initially random values are given to each one of the parameters and, then, these parameters are adapted during the optimization process. The proposed Adaptive BBMO algorithm is used for the solution of the Multicast Routing Problem (MRP). As we would like to prove that the proposed algorithm is suitable for solving different kinds of combinatorial optimization problems we test the algorithm, also, in the Probabilistic Traveling Salesman Problem (PTSP) and in the Hierarchical Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem (HPFSP). Finally, the algorithm is tested in four classic benchmark functions for global optimization problems (Rosenbrock, Sphere, Rastrigin and Griewank) in order to prove the generality of the procedure. A number of benchmark instances for all problems are tested using the proposed algorithm in order to prove its effectiveness.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "1111270", "output": "\"Optimizing Biomarker Identification in Small-Sample Studies through AUC-Based Correlation Analysis\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Biomarker Identification in High-Dimensional Spaces\", \"AUC-Based Approach for Biomarker Discovery\"]\n\n<features>\n\nNone received\n\n<otherwriters>\n\n[\"Optimizing Biomarker Identification in Small", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Measured values are commonly gained from high-throughput technologies like next generation sequencing leading to an abundance of biomarker candidates compared to the often very small sample size. Here we use an example with more than 50,000 biomarker candidates that we want to evaluate based on a sample of only 24 patients. This seems to be an impossible task and finding purely random-based correlations is guaranteed. Although we cannot identify specific biomarkers in such small pilot studies with purely statistical methods, one can still derive whether there are more biomarkers showing a high correlation with the disease under consideration than one would expect in a setting where correlations are purely random. We propose a method based on area under the ROC curve (AUC) values that indicates how much correlations of the biomarkers with the disease of interest exceed pure random effects. We also provide estimations of sample sizes for follow-up studies to actually identify concrete biomarkers and build classifiers for the disease. We also describe how our method can be extended to other performance measures than AUC.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111271", "output": "Based on the provided features, I've generated a title for the abstract.\n\n\"Novel Approaches to Weak Supervision in Object Detection: Combining Pointwise Mutual Information and Cosine Loss for Improved Accuracy\"\n\nor \n\n\"Weakly Supervised Object Detection with Pointwise Mutual Information and Cosine Loss: A Novel Framework", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A fully convolutional neural network architecture is applied in which the network learns one filter per object class. The resulting feature map indicates the location of objects in an image, yielding an intuitive representation of a class activation map. While traditionally such networks are learned by a softmax or binary logistic regression (sigmoid cross-entropy loss), a learning approach based on a cosine loss is introduced. A pointwise mutual information layer is incorporated in the network in order to project predictions and ground truth presence labels in a non-categorical embedding space. Thus, the cosine loss can be employed in this non-categorical representation. Besides integrating image level annotations, it is shown how to integrate point-wise annotations using a Spatial Pyramid Pooling layer. The approach is evaluated on the VOC2012 dataset for classification, point localization and weakly supervised bounding box localization. It is shown that the combination of pointwise mutual information and a cosine loss eases the learning process and thus improves the accuracy. The integration of coarse point-wise localizations further improves the results at minimal annotation costs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111272", "output": "Optimizing Job Dispatching in Exascale HPC Systems through Data-Driven Job Duration Prediction and Real-Time Resource Allocation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This evaluation metric can be robustly applied to any simulated traffic flow data; in other words, it is independent of how the traffic data are generated. We demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of this metric through many experiments on real-world traffic data and various simulated traffic data, comparisons with the state-of-the-art entropy-based similarity metric for aggregate crowd motions, and perceptual evaluation studies.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "1111274", "output": "\"Optimizing IoT Security Provisioning: A Formal Approach to Mitigating Risk in Dynamic Environments\"\n\nor\n\n\"A Dynamic Security Resource Allocation Framework for IoT Scenarios: Minimizing Risk through Optimization\"\n\nor\n\n\"Risk-Informed Security Provisioning for IoT Environments: A Novel Optimization-Based Approach\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

One component of these serving infrastructures that features prominently in this build-out is their connectivity fabric; i.e., the set of all Internet interconnections that content has to traverse en route from the CP's various \"deployments\" or \"serving sites\" to end users. However, these connectivity fabrics have received little attention in the past and remain largely ill-understood.\n\nIn this paper, we describe the results of an in-depth study of the connectivity fabric of Akamai. Our study reveals that Akamai's connectivity fabric consists of some 6,100 different \"explicit\" peerings (i.e., Akamai is one of the two involved peers) and about 28,500 different \"implicit\" peerings (i.e., Akamai is neither of the two peers). Our work contributes to a better understanding of real-world serving infrastructures by providing an original account of implicit peerings and demonstrating the performance benefits that Akamai can reap from leveraging its rich connectivity fabric for serving its customers' content to end users.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "1111276", "output": "\"Securing the Unseen: A Critical Examination of Smart Plugs in the Era of Internet of Things\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The latter may introduce new constants to the program (known as value invention), which can lead to infinite answer sets and non-termination; to prevent this, syntactic safety conditions on programs are common which considerably limit expressiveness (in particular, recursion). We present liberal domain-expansion (lde) safe programs, a novel generic class of ASP programs with external source access and value invention that enjoy finite restrictability, i.e., equivalence to a finite ground version. They use term bounding functions as a parametric notion of safety, which can be instantiated with syntactic, semantic or combined safety criteria; this empowers us to generalize and integrate many other notions of safety from the literature, and modular composition of criteria makes future extensions easy. Furthermore, we devise a grounding algorithm for lde-safe programs which in contrast to traditional algorithms can ground any such program directly without the need for program decomposition. While we present our approach on top of a proposed formalism in order to make the formalization precise, the general concepts carry over to related formalisms and important special cases as well. An experimental evaluation of lde-safety on various applications confirms the practicability of our approach.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111278", "output": "\"Enabling Nonvisual Navigation of Two-Dimensional Interfaces via Spatial Region Interaction Techniques\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These visual-spatial cues enhance the interaction experience of sighted users. However, the linear nature of screen translation tools currently available to blind users make it difficult to understand or navigate these structures. We introduce Spatial Region Interaction Techniques (SPRITEs) for nonvisual access: a novel method for navigating two-dimensional structures using the keyboard surface. SPRITEs 1) preserve spatial layout, 2) enable bimanual interaction, and 3) improve the end user experience. We used a series of design probes to explore different methods for keyboard surface interaction. Our evaluation of SPRITEs shows that three times as many participants were able to complete spatial tasks with SPRITEs than with their preferred current technology.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.36}, {"id": "1111279", "output": "\"Local Restrictions in Complexity Analysis: New Applications for the Isomorphism Conjecture and Boolean Formula Satisfiability\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Most of the proposed techniques have high computation complexity or based on heuristic approaches. This paper proposes a novel two-tier classification models based on machine learning approaches Na\u00efve Bayes, certainty factor voting version of KNN classifiers and also Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimension reduction. Experimental results show a desirable and promising gain in detection rate and false alarm compared with other existing models. The model also trained by two generated balance training sets using SMOTE method to evaluate the chosen similarity measure for dealing with imbalanced network anomaly data sets. The two-tier model provides low computation time due to optimal dimension reduction and feature selection, as well as good detection rate against rare and complex attack types which are so dangerous because of their close similarity to normal behaviors like User to Root and Remote to Local. All evaluation processes experimented by NSL-KDD data set.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111281", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.

Increases in the range of pixel values and various tone mapping operations on those pixel values mean that the histogram bins often contain no pixels. Recently, this sparseness of the histogram was used to increase the lossless coding performance by introducing histogram packing. This approach was extended to lossy coding by combining spatial quantization and lossless coding. However, such methods do not satisfy the near lossless (NL) condition. In contrast, conventional NL coding such as the JPEG-LS standard satisfies the NL condition, but does not use the histogram sparseness. In this paper, a simple ZS.Q procedure is introduced that uses the histogram sparseness to increase coding efficiency under the NL condition. The proposed method has the following advantages: 1) It guarantees the maximum quantization error is less than some threshold; 2) It can be combined with an arbitrary lossless encoder, such as lossless JPEG 2000 or lossless JPEG-LS; 3) Coding errors do not accumulate under repeat encoding and decoding.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.04}, {"id": "1111282", "output": "Segmentation of Ischemic Stroke Lesion from IsLES-2015 Dataset Using Wavelet Denoising and Random Forest Classification", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The dataset comprises 28 stroke cases of magnetic resonance (MR) images. This study considers fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR images for the segmentation of lesions. MR images are affected by various artifacts and noise. Hence, we applied wavelet based data denoising technique by optimal parameter selection for stroke lesion enhancement followed by random forest (RF). RF classifier was trained for different part of the brain for segmenting the stroke lesion. The obtained results show best overall segmentation accuracy when compared with the other methods. To measure the image similarity between the ground truth and the segmented image, we used the evaluation method provided by the ISLES-2015. The average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of the segmentation was measured to be 4.57 mm, while Dice\u2019s coefficient ((DC) lies between 0 and 1) was used to measure the volume overlap accuracy with an average of 0.67. The maximum of all surface distance was given by Hausdorff distance (HD) with an average of 28.09 mm. The average precision and average recall observed was 0.70 and 0.71 respectively. The ISLES image data and ground truth images kept on being openly accessible through an online virtual skeleton database which is an ongoing benchmarking resource.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "1111283", "output": "\"Practical Beam Selection and Power Optimization for Precoder Design in Geometric Massive MIMO Systems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We consider two different channel models and provide an optimal solution for the joint beam selection and power optimization as well as a heuristic using Lagrangian relaxation. Assuming knowledge of the beamspace channel, the beamspace precoder consists in selecting and optimizing the power of the beams steered to the user equipments (UEs) in order to maximize the signal\u2010to\u2010interference\u2010plus\u2010noise ratio at the UE. Furthermore, we propose three additional simple heuristics with low complexity. For these three heuristics, we solve the problem in two steps: (1) selection of beams based on the maximal ratio transmission principle and (2) power allocation per UE. Simulation results show that our optimal solution can achieve a better performance than the zero\u2010forcing beamforming scheme in the high\u2010sparsity scenarios. Besides, compared to the linear maximal ratio transmission precoder, the proposed low\u2010complexity heuristics improve the performance under a scenario with channel sparsity. View Figure We propose a precoder design considering practical rate assignment (based on the MCS of the LTE table), beam selection, and power optimization, which exploits the geometric sparsity of the multiuser massive MIMO channel using its beamspace representation. We show an optimal solution to capacity (sum rate) following the MRT principle combined with beam selection, called MRT with selection, and we design a new heuristic to simplify this beam selection and power optimization procedure based on Lagrangian relaxation.Furthermore, we propose three additional simple heuristics with low complexity.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "1111284", "output": "Comparison of Classification Measures for Imbalanced Data: A Visualisation Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To do so, we show how to express polarisation constraints as equations that are linear in the unknown height. The local ambiguity in the surface normal azimuth angle is resolved globally when the optimal surface height is reconstructed. Our method is applicable to dielectric objects exhibiting diffuse and specular reflectance, though lighting and albedo must be known. We relax this requirement by showing that either spatially varying albedo or illumination can be estimated from the polarisation image alone using nonlinear methods. In the case of illumination, the estimate can only be made up to a binary ambiguity which we show is a generalised Bas-relief transformation corresponding to the convex/concave ambiguity. We believe that our method is the first passive, monocular shape-from-x technique that enables well-posed height estimation with only a single, uncalibrated illumination condition. We present results on real world data, including in uncontrolled, outdoor illumination.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111287", "output": "Approximate Error Metrics for Testing Approximate Integrated Circuits: Challenges and Opportunities in ME Metric Testing", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Specifically, application resiliency allows a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency (energy/area/performance). Therefore, in recent years, Error Metrics have been proposed to model and quantify such accuracy reduction. In addition, Error thresholds are usually provided for defining the maximum allowed accuracy reduction. From a testing point of view, Approximate Integrated Circuits offer several opportunities. Indeed, approximation allows one to individuate a subset of tolerable faults, which are classified according to the adopted threshold. Thanks to fewer required test vectors, one achieves test-cost reduction and improvements in yield. Therefore, using metrics based on the calculation of Mean Errors (ME metrics), has become a major testing challenge. In this paper, we present this problem and investigate the technical requirements necessary for ME metric testing. We perform experiments on arithmetic circuits to study opportunities and challenges in terms of complexity. Our results show that one can filter up to 21% of faults and also highlight the complexity of the problem in terms of execution-time.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111288", "output": "\"Challenges in Modeling Transistor Degradation in Microprocessor Cores: A Review of Current Limitations and Future Directions\"\n\nor \n\n\"Aging Microprocessors: Current Models and Future Directions in Transistor Degradation Estimation\"\n\nor \n\n\"Assessing Device Aging in Microprocessor Cores: A Review of", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Performance in such tuned packages is attained through tuning of several algorithmic and architectural parameters such as number of parallel operations in the Directed Acyclic Graph of the BLAS/LAPACK routines, sizes of the memories in the memory hierarchy of the underlying platform, bandwidth of the memory, and structure of the compute resources in the underlying platform. In this paper, we closely investigate the impact of the Floating Point Unit (FPU) micro- architecture for performance tuning of BLAS and LAPACK. We present theoretical analysis for pipeline depth of different floating point operations like multiplier, adder, square root, and divider followed by characterization of BLAS and LAPACK to determine several parameters required in the theoretical framework for deciding optimum pipeline depth of the floating operations. A simple design of a Processing Element (PE) is presented and shown that the PE outperforms the most recent custom realizations of BLAS and LAPACK by 1 : 1 X to 1 : 5 X in GFlops/W, and 1 : 9 X to 2 : 1 X in Gflops/mm(2). Compared to multicore, General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and ClearSpeed CSX700, performance improvement of 1.8-80x is reported in PE.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "1111290", "output": "\"Edge-Controlled PubSub Architectures: Leveraging SRv6 Network Programmability for Efficient Data Distribution and Resource Optimization\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"PubSub Architectures for Industrial Applications\"\n\"Network-Assisted PubSub Systems for Efficient Data Dissemination\"\n\"SRv6-Based Solutions for Edge-Controlled Data Distribution", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While the publish-subscribe (PubSub) architecture is well-suited for such large-scale data dissemination, existing over-the-top PubSub systems are not only vulnerable to network-induced performance degradation, but also unable to orchestrate the underlying network for better usage. This paper proposes a network-assisted PubSub architecture called SNAPS which enables seamless control of distributed PubSub brokers at the edge, as well as the network that interconnects them. SNAPS leverages SRv6-based network programmability to build and maintain network-efficient, shareable data distribution trees for brokers. The architecture is independent of broker implementation, making it suitable for \u201cbringing your own brokers\u201d at available edge locations. We describe how the network interconnecting the brokers can be programmed for efficient data distribution. Through simulation and prototype evaluation, we show the efficacy of SNAPS in providing better service for PubSub data delivery and better usage of the network resources.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111291", "output": "Improved Lower Bounds for HAMILTONIAN CYCLE and GRAPH COLORING on Graphs of Bounded Clique-Width", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Each of these problems can be solved in time g(k)nf(k) on graphs of clique-width k. Fomin et al. (2010) showed that the running times cannot be improved to g(k)nO(1) assuming W[1]\u2260FPT. However, this does not rule out non-trivial improvements to the exponent f(k) in the running times. In a follow-up paper, Fomin et al. (2014) improved the running times for EDGE DOMINATING SET and MAX-CUT to nO(k), and proved that these problems cannot be solved in time g(k)no(k) unless ETH fails. Thus, prior to this work, EDGE DOMINATING SET and MAX-CUT were known to have tight n\u0398 (k) algorithmic upper and lower bounds.\n\nIn this article, we provide lower bounds for HAMILTONIAN CYCLE and GRAPH COLORING. For HAMILTONIAN CYCLE, our lower bound g(k)no(k) matches asymptotically the recent upper bound nO(k) due to Bergougnoux, Kant\u00e9, and Kwon (2017).\n\nAs opposed to the asymptotically tight n\u0398(k) bounds for EDGE DOMINATING SET, MAX-CUT, and HAMILTONIAN CYCLE, the GRAPH COLORING problem has an upper bound of nO(2k) and a lower bound of merely no(&sqrt; [4]k) (implicit from the W[1]-hardness proof). In this article, we close the gap for GRAPH COLORING by proving a lower bound of n2o(k). This shows that GRAPH COLORING behaves qualitatively different from the other three problems. To the best of our knowledge, GRAPH COLORING is the first natural problem known to require exponential dependence on the parameter in the exponent of n.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "1111292", "output": "\"Verification of Synchronous Multi-Agent Systems with Imperfect Information: A Public Action Perspective\"\n\nor\n\n\"Public Action Verification for Synchronous, Perfect Recall Multi-Agent Systems with Imperfect Information\"\n\nor\n\n\"Solving the Verification Problem for Synchronous Multi-Agent Systems with Imperfect Information in the Presence of Public Actions\"\n\nor \n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Due to the large amount of images and videos and the limited computational resource, effective and efficient object detection is challenging. Although much effort has been done to develop fast object detection algorithms, little work was concentrated on energy-saving algorithms. Even two detection algorithms that detect objects in the same speed may consume different electronic energies. In this paper, we focus on developing an energy-saving object detection algorithm which can reject a bundle of neighboring sub-images with only one inner-product operation and an acceptable number of addition ones. The total number of multiplications and additions of our algorithm is almost equal to that of the traditional sliding-window method. But in our algorithm the number of multiplication operations is much smaller. Because addition operation consumes less energy than multiplication operation, the proposed method is more energy-saving and efficient. Experimental results on hand detection show that our approach leads to significant improvements in energy and efficiency.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.35}, {"id": "1111294", "output": "\"Real-Time Analysis of Humanoid Robot Software: A Case Study on the Efficacy of Dynamic Error Detectors and Static Analysis Tools in Simulated and Real Environments\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Humanoid robots, and cyber-physical systems in general, present unique challenges to testing and validation: they have realtime constraints, their runs are typically irreproducible, their tasks are high-level and preclude formal specification, and their software tends to be large and complex. In practice, bugs do cause robots to fail, and methods for analyzing such software has been wanting. This paper presents a case study, in which we find that traditional software bugs like memory errors do cause failures of robots in practice. Dynamic error detectors can be successfully employed to identify such errors - to an extent defined by realtime constraints. Static analysis tools, in their current form, are comparatively of limited use.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "1111295", "output": "\"Formal Analysis of Bitcoin's Target (Re) Calculation Function in the Presence of Malicious Adversaries\"\n\nor\n\n\"Robustness of Bitcoin's Blockchain Data Structure Against Actively Malicious Miners\"\n\nor\n\n\"Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment and Robustness of the Bitcoin Blockchain in the Face of Adversarial", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Importantly, these proofs of work have to be hard enough so that miners have an opportunity to unify their views in the presence of an adversary who interferes but has bounded computational power, but easy enough to be solvable regularly and enable the miners to make progress. As such, as the miners' population evolves over time, so should the difficulty of these proofs. Bitcoin provides this adjustment mechanism, with empirical evidence of a constant block generation rate against such population changes. In this paper we provide the first formal analysis of Bitcoin's target (re) calculation function in the cryptographic setting, i.e., against all possible adversaries aiming to subvert the protocol's properties. We extend the q-bounded synchronous model of the Bitcoin backbone protocol [Eurocrypt 2015], which posed the basic properties of Bitcoin's underlying blockchain data structure and shows how a robust public transaction ledger can be built on top of them, to environments that may introduce or suspend parties in each round. We provide a set of necessary conditions with respect to the way the population evolves under which the \"Bitcoin backbone with chains of variable difficulty\" provides a robust transaction ledger in the presence of an actively malicious adversary controlling a fraction of the miners strictly below 50% at each instant of the execution.

To enable high availability and scalability, a new class of weakly consistent data stores has become popular. However, some data needs strong consistency. To manipulate both weakly and strongly consistent data in a single transaction, we introduce a new abstraction: mixed-consistency transactions, embodied in a new embedded language, MixT. Programmers explicitly associate consistency models with remote storage sites; each atomic, isolated transaction can access a mixture of data with different consistency models. Compile-time information-flow checking, applied to consistency models, ensures that these models are mixed safely and enables the compiler to automatically partition transactions. New run-time mechanisms ensure that consistency models can also be mixed safely, even when the data used by a transaction resides on separate, mutually unaware stores. Performance measurements show that despite their stronger guarantees, mixed-consistency transactions retain much of the speed of weak consistency, significantly outperforming traditional serializable transactions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.33}, {"id": "1111300", "output": "Reachability Analysis of Multimodal Graph Modelled Collections: Faceted Search for Enhanced Information Retrieval\n\nor\n\nMultimodal Graph-Based Information Retrieval: Faceted Search for Improved Reachability\n\nor\n\nFaceted Search for Multimodal Graph Modelled Collections: A Study on Reachability and Recall", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Information objects are not isolated anymore. They are frequently connected via metadata, semantic links, etc. This leads to various challenges in graph-based information retrieval. This paper is concerned with the reachability analysis of multimodal graph modelled collections. We use our framework to leverage the combination of features of different modalities through our formulation of faceted search. This study highlights the effect of different facets and link types in improving reachability of relevant information objects. The experiments are performed on the Image CLEF 2011 Wikipedia collection with about 400,000 documents and images. The results demonstrate that the combination of different facets is conductive to obtain higher reachability. We obtain 373% recall gain for very hard topics by using our graph model of the collection. Further, by adding semantic links to the collection, we gain a 10% increase in the overall recall.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.12}, {"id": "1111301", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Efficient Genome Read Compression\", \"Compressing Genomic Reads with Hashed Substring Indices\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- Use of \"approximately\" in the abstract (indicating a probabilistic approach)\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, general-purpose compressors are unable to exploit this redundancy due to the special structure present in the data. Results: We present a new algorithm for compressing reads both with and without preserving the read order. In both cases, it achieves 1.4x-2x compression gain over state-of-the-art read compression tools for datasets containing as many as 3 billion Illumina reads. Our tool is based on the idea of approximately reordering the reads according to their position in the genome using hashed substring indices. We also present a systematic analysis of the read compression problem and compute bounds on fundamental limits of read compression. This analysis sheds light on the dynamics of the proposed algorithm (and read compression algorithms in general) and helps understand its performance in practice. The algorithm compresses only the read sequence, works with unaligned FASTQ files, and does not require a reference.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111302", "output": "Based on the provided features, I've generated a title for the abstract:\n\n\"Decentralized Crowdsensing with Autonomous Mobile Agents: A Framework for Efficient Task Execution and Real-Time Data Sharing\"\n\nUsing the provided similar abstract-title pairs, I noticed that they often include keywords like \"mobile agents,\" \"crowdsensing,\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Crowdsensing campaigns are designed through different roles that are implemented as mobile agents. The role-based tasks of mobile agents include collecting data, analyzing data and sharing data in the campaign. Mobile agents execute and control the campaign autonomously as a multi-agent system and migrate in the opportunistic network of participants' devices. Mobile agents take into account the available resources in the devices and match participants' privacy requirements to the campaign requirements. Sharing of task results in real-time facilitates cooperation towards the campaign goal while maintaining a selected global measure, such as energy efficiency. We discuss current challenges in crowdsensing and propose mobile agent based solutions for campaign execution and monitoring, addressing data collection and participant-related issues. We present a software framework for mobile agents-based crowdsensing that is seamlessly integrated into the Web. A set of simulations are conducted to compare mobile agent-based campaigns with existing crowdsensing approaches. We implemented and evaluated a small-scale real-world mobile agent based campaign for pedestrian flock detection. The simulation and evaluation results show that mobile agent based campaigns produce comparable results with less energy consumption when the number of agents is relatively small and enables in-network data processing with sharing of data and task results with insignificant overhead.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111303", "output": "\"Unlocking Smart City Potential: A Global Research Partnership for Intelligent Urban Governance\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Since these WBAN users have individual decision-making capabilities and are self-centric in nature, they always aim to maximize their own performance while expecting benefits through resource sharing. In this article, we analyze the interaction among participating WBANs in BBN and develop joint data uploading and relaying strategy. In BBN, each WBAN not only utilizes its resources (uplink capacity and battery energy) to upload physiological data but also trades resources with other participating WBANs. Specifically, WBAN users with unused resources trade with other users deprived of Internet connection and low battery for mutual gain. Therefore, we model this interaction as an \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$N $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-person bargaining game and design an efficient incentive mechanism to facilitate user cooperation. The proposed mechanism ensures efficient resource sharing and fair division of mutual benefit among the participating WBAN users. Also, we propose a distributed algorithm for the practical implementation of the proposed mechanism in decentralized BBN. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism always improves WBAN user\u2019s individual performance together with the overall BBN performance. Furthermore, the overall performance increases with an increase in participating WBAN users\u2019 resource heterogeneity.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "1111305", "output": "\"Primitives, Planning, and Control for Dynamic Hybrid Manipulation: A Framework for Robust and Adaptive Task Execution\"\n\nor\n\n\"Task-Oriented Hybrid Manipulation: A Unified Framework for Determining Primitives, Sequencing Tasks, and Stabilizing Modes\"\n\nor\n\n\"Primitives, Sequences, and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We apply the framework to plan a sequence of motions for manipulating a block with a planar 3R manipulator. We demonstrate preliminary experimental results for a block resting on the manipulator with a desired goal state on a ledge outside of the robotu0027s workspace. The planned primitives reorient the block using a series of fixed, rolling, and sliding contact modes, and throw it to the goal state.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111306", "output": "\"Enhanced Security and Efficiency in IoT Authentication: A Comparative Analysis of Novel Models and Protocols\"\n\nor alternatively \n\n\"A Novel Approach to Securing IoT Devices: Designing Efficient Authentication Protocols for Low-Resource Environments\"\n\nor \n\n\"Authentication for the Internet of Things: A Comparative Study of Optimized Models and Prot", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We propose several dependency and constituent-based structures, also enriched with Linked Open Data (LD) knowledge to represent pairs of questions and answer passages. We encode such tree structures in learning-to-rank (L2R) algorithms using tree kernels, which can project them in tree substructure spaces, where each dimension represents a powerful syntactic/semantic feature. Additionally, since we define links between question and passage structures, our tree kernel spaces also include relational structural features. We carried out an extensive comparative experimentation of our models for automatic answer selection benchmarks on different TREC QA corpora as well as the newer Wikipedia-based dataset, namely WikiQA, which has been widely used to test sentence rerankers. The results consistently demonstrate that our structural semantic models achieve the state of the art in passage reranking. In particular, we derived the following important findings: (i) relational syntactic structures are essential to achieve superior results; (ii) models trained with dependency trees can outperform those trained with shallow trees, e.g., in case of sentence reranking; (iii) external knowledge automatically generated with focus and question classifiers is very effective; and (iv) the semantic information derived by LD and incorporated in syntactic structures can be used to replace the knowledge provided by the above-mentioned classifiers. This is a remarkable advantage as it enables our models to increase coverage and portability over new domains.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111308", "output": "\"Unveiling Cellular Dynamics through Advanced Bio-Imaging Techniques\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This problem entails reduction of the points in a given trajectory while keeping the relevant points which preserve important information. The benefits include storage reduction, computational expense, while making data more manageable.Common techniques formulate a minimization problem to be solved, where the solution is found iteratively under some error metric, which causes the algorithms to work in super-linear time. We present an algorithm called FastSTray, which selects the relevant points in the trajectory in linear time by following an \"open loop\" heuristic approach. While most current trajectory simplification algorithms are tailored for GPS trajectories, our approach focuses on smooth trajectories for robot programming by demonstration recorded using motion capture systems.Two variations of the algorithm are presented: 1) aims to preserve shape and temporal information; 2) preserves only shape information. Using the points in the simplified trajectory we use cubic splines to interpolate between these points and recreate the original trajectory. The presented algorithm was tested on trajectories recorded from a hand-tracking system. It was able to eliminate about 90% of the points in the original trajectories while maintaining errors between 0.78-2cm which corresponds to 1%-2.4% relative error with respect to the bounding box of the trajectories.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111310", "output": "Optimal Power Allocation and Precoding for Single-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (SU-MIMO) Links in Spectrum-Sharing Environments with Interference Constraints.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Assuming channel knowledge at the transmitter, the maximization of the mutual information of a MIMO link is achieved by finding the optimal power allocation under a given sum-power constraint, which is in turn obtained by the water-filling (WF) algorithm. However, in spectrum sharing setups, such as Licensed Shared Access (LSA), where a primary link (PL) and a secondary link (SL) coexist, the power transmitted by the SL transmitter may induce harmful interference to the PL receiver. While such co-existing links have been considered extensively in various spectrum sharing setups, the mutual information of the SL under a constraint on the interference it may cause to the PL receiver has, quite astonishingly, not been evaluated so far. In this paper, we solve this problem, find its unique optimal solution and provide the power allocation policy and corresponding precoding solution that achieves the optimal capacity under the imposed constraint. The performance of the optimal solution and the penalty due to the interference constraint are evaluated over some indicative Rayleigh fading channel conditions and interference thresholds. We believe that the obtained results are of general nature and that they may apply, beyond spectrum sharing, to a variety of applications that admit a similar setup.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.67}, {"id": "1111311", "output": "\"Enhancing MOEA/D's Performance for Discontinuous Pareto Fronts via Adaptive Weight Vector Adjustment\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

It decomposes a multi-objective problem into subproblems by mathematic programming methods and applies evolutionary algorithms to optimize the subproblems simultaneously. MOEA/D is good at finding Pareto solutions which are evenly distributed. However, it can be improved for problems with discontinuous Pareto fronts (PF). Many solutions will assemble in breakpoints in this situation. A method for adjusting weight vectors for bi-objective optimization problems with discontinuous PF is proposed. Firstly, this method detects the weight vectors which need to be adjusted using a property of MOEA/D. Secondly, the reserved vectors are divided into several subsets. Thirdly, after calculating the ideal number of vectors in each subset, vectors are adjusted evenly. Lastly, the corresponding solutions are updated by a linear interpolation. Numerical experiment shows the proposed method obtains good diversity and convergence on approached PF.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "1111312", "output": "\"End-to-End Speechreading via Convolutional Neural Networks: A Novel Approach to Generating Intelligible Speech from Silent Video Frames\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Nevertheless, even though twins may look alike, we believe they speak differently. Hence we propose to use their voice patterns to distinguish between twins. Voice is a natural signal to produce, and it is a combination of physiological and behavioral biometrics, therefore it is suitable for twin verification. In this paper, we collect an audio-visual database from 39 pairs of identical twins. Three types of typical voice features are investigated, including Pitch, Linear Prediction Coefficients (LPC) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). For each type of voice feature, we use Gaussian Mixture Model to model the voice spectral distribution of each subject, and then employ the likelihood ratio of the probe belonging to different classes for verification. The experimental results on this database demonstrate a significant improvement by using voice over facial appearance to distinguish between identical twins. Furthermore, we show that by fusion both types of biometrics, recognition accuracy can be improved.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.08}, {"id": "1111315", "output": "Temporal Graph Reasoning for Video Captioning: Long Short-Term Relation Transformer", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Since there are multiple objects in videos, taking full exploration of the spatial and temporal relationships among them is crucial for this task. The previous methods wrap the detected objects as input sequences, and leverage vanilla self-attention or graph neural network to reason about visual relations. This cannot make full use of the spatial and temporal nature of a video, and suffers from the problems of redundant connections, over-smoothing, and relation ambiguity. In order to address the above problems, in this paper we construct a long short-term graph (LSTG) that simultaneously captures short-term spatial semantic relations and long-term transformation dependencies. Further, to perform relational reasoning over the LSTG, we design a global gated graph reasoning module (G3RM), which introduces a global gating based on global context to control information propagation between objects and alleviate relation ambiguity. Finally, by introducing G3RM into Transformer instead of self-attention, we propose the long short-term relation transformer (LSRT) to fully mine objects' relations for caption generation. Experiments on MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets show that the LSRT achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. The visualization results indicate that our method alleviates problem of over-smoothing and strengthens the ability of relational reasoning.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.34}, {"id": "1111316", "output": "\"Denoising Time Differences of Arrival: A Relaxation of Source Localization in the TDOA Space\"\n\nor\n\n\"Relaxing the Denoising Problem in Time Difference of Arrival Space for Source Localization\"\n\nor\n\n\"Linear Operations for TDOA Denoising: A Solution to Source Localization in the TDO", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

More specifically, we show that source localization can be interpreted as a denoising problem of TDOA measurements. As this denoising problem is difficult to solve in general, our analysis shows that it is possible to resort to a relaxed version of it. The solution of the relaxed problem through linear operations in the TDOA space is then discussed, and its analysis leads to a parallelism with other state-of-the-art TDOA denoising algorithms. Additionally, we extend the proposed solution also to the case where only TDOAs between few pairs of microphones within an array have been computed. The reported denoising algorithms are all analytically justified, and numerically tested through simulative campaign.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111317", "output": "\"Enhancing Phase Change Memory Read Efficiency through Early Termination of Read-Friendly Data Blocks\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Among the components of a computer system, main memory has a great impact on overall system performance. DRAM technology has been used over the past four decades to build main memories. However, the scalability of DRAM technology has faced serious challenges. To keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for larger main memory, some new alternative technologies have been introduced. Phase change memory (PCM) is considered as one of such technologies for substituting DRAM. PCM offers some noteworthy properties such as low static power consumption, nonvolatility, and capability of storing more than one bit per cell (multilevel cell, or MLC). However, the short lifetime and long access latency of PCM (specifically MLC PCM) require feasible and efficient solutions.\n\nIn this article, based on the observation that applications access a significant number of read-friendly data blocks, we propose Express Read to prevent the MLC PCM read circuit to spend unnecessary time sensing the cells of a memory block. A read-friendly data block (RFDB) is composed of only \u201c11\u201d and \u201c00\u201d bit pairs, and thus upon sensing the most significant bit of a cell, the read operation can be early terminated to reduce the MLC read time and power consumption. Moreover, we increase the number of RFDBs using two simple techniques to better exploit the benefits of Express Read. Results obtained from full-system simulation near 6% performance improvement and 21% energy gain, on average, over the baseline system.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111318", "output": "\"Gradient-Based Optimization for Non-Convex and Non-Smooth Functions: Convergence Rates and Applications\"\n\nor \n\n\"Non-Convex and Non-Smooth Function Optimization: A Comparative Analysis of Gradient-Based Methods\"\n\nor \n\n\"Escape from Saddle Points: Gradient-Based Methods for Non-Convex and Non", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Studying a fairly broad class of such problems, we analyze the behavior of three gradient-based methods (gradient descent, proximal update, and Frank-Wolfe update). For each of these methods, we establish rates of convergence for general problems, and also prove faster rates for continuous sub-analytic functions. We also show that our algorithms can escape strict saddle points for a class of non-smooth functions, thereby generalizing known results for smooth functions. Our analysis leads to a simplification of the popular CCCP algorithm, used for optimizing functions that can be written as a difference of two convex functions. Our simplified algorithm retains all the convergence properties of CCCP, along with a significantly lower cost per iteration. We illustrate our methods and theory via applications to the problems of best subset selection, robust estimation, mixture density estimation, and shape-from-shading reconstruction.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111319", "output": "\" WiFi-based Passive Localization: A Unified Model for Single-Link Estimation and Tracking\"\n\nor\n\n\"Single-Link WiFi Localization: Bridging the Gap with Multi-Dimensional Signal Parameters\"\n\nor\n\n\"Widar2.0: A WiFi-based System for Passive Human Localization and Tracking using Single-Link Multi-Dimensional Signal", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Previous works based on either specialized or commercial hardware all require multiple links, preventing their wide adoption in scenarios like homes where typically only one single AP is installed. The key insight underlying Widar2.0 to circumvent the use of multiple links is to leverage multi-dimensional signal parameters from one single link. To this end, we build a unified model accounting for Angle-of-Arrival, Time-of-Flight, and Doppler shifts together and devise an efficient algorithm for their joint estimation. We then design a pipeline to translate the erroneous raw parameters into precise locations, which first finds parameters corresponding to the reflections of interests, then refines range estimates, and ultimately outputs target locations. Our implementation and evaluation on commodity WiFi devices demonstrate that Widar2.0 achieves better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art localization systems, which either use specialized hardwares or require 2 to 40 Wi-Fi links.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111320", "output": "Based on the provided similar abstract-title pairs, I notice that they all follow a pattern of incorporating the phrase \"maximum volume\" or \"maximum volume\" related concepts.

This simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) model and the associated factorization techniques have spurred much interest in research topics over different areas, such as hyperspectral unmixing in remote sensing and topic discovery in machine learning, to name a few. In this paper we develop a new theoretical SSMF framework whose idea is to study a maximum volume ellipsoid inscribed in the convex hull of the data points. This maximum volume inscribed ellipsoid (MVIE) idea has not been attempted in prior literature, and we show a sufficient condition under which the MVIE framework guarantees exact recovery of the factors. The sufficient recovery condition we show for MVIE is much more relaxed than that of separable nonnegative matrix factorization (or pure-pixel search); coincidentally, it is also identical to that of minimum volume enclosing simplex, which is known to be a powerful SSMF framework for nonseparable problem instances. We also show that MVIE can be practically implemented by performing facet enumeration and then by solving a convex optimization problem. The potential of the MVIE framework is illustrated by numerical results.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.09}, {"id": "1111321", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generate the title:\n\n\"Trading Strategies in Complex Dynamical Systems: A Study of Fundamentalist, Chartist, and Zero-Information Traders\"\n\nor\n\n\"Market Dynamics and Trading Success: An Analysis of Fundamentalist, Chartist, and Zero-Information Strategies\"\n\nor\n\n\"Ev", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Stock-price movements are not solely driven by fundamental values but in particular influenced by short term trading behaviour. Chartists use trends to forecast future price directions, whereas fundamentalists estimate stock prices based on dividend payouts or company earnings. Such strategies can similarly be deployed in automatic trading agents, which already account for a large portion of current trading activity. It is therefore vital to understand how these trading strategies behave in different scenarios, and how the interplay of strategies may lead to various market outcomes. In this paper we analyse the dynamics of three different trading strategies: fundamentalist, chartist, and zero-information traders, who base their trading behaviour on the current market price only. We simulate stock markets with various constellations of trading agents, and compare their evolutionary strength, using heuristic payoff tables and the replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory. Our results show that it is not straightforward to predict in advance which trading strategy will perform best. Fundamentalists outperform other traders, and drive them out of the market, when information is freely available. If fundamental information is costly, chartists may thrive. As such, this paper sheds light on the various factors that play a role in determining success or failure of trading strategies in a complex market.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111322", "output": "Optimizing Collective Operations on the IBM Blue Gene/Q: Scalable Algorithms for High-Throughput and Low-Latency MPI Collective Communications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Each BG/Q node has 68 hardware threads. Hybrid programming paradigms, which use message passing among nodes and multi-threading within nodes, enable applications to achieve high throughput on BG/Q. In this paper, we present scalable algorithms to optimize MPI collective operations by taking advantage of the various features of the BG/Q torus and collective networks. We achieve an 8 byte double-sum MPI_Allreduce latency of 10.25 ms on 1,572,864 MPI ranks. We accelerate summing of network packets with local buffers by the use of the Quad Processing SIMD unit in the BG/Q cores and executing the sums on multiple communication threads supported by the optimized communication libraries. The achieved net gain is a peak throughput of 6.3 GB/s for double-sum allreduce. We also achieve over 90% of network peak for MPI_Alltoall with 65,536 MPI ranks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "1111323", "output": "\"Designing Modular Light Signaling for Human-Robot Interaction: A Modular Research Tool for Flexible and Expressive Signaling Mechanisms\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the wide range of robot shapes and sizes makes it difficult for researchers to quickly prototype and evaluate different light configurations and signal designs. In this work, we present the design of ModLight, a modular research tool consisting of a set of low cost light blocks that can be easily reconfigured to fit a myriad of robots and applications. ModLight also provides researchers, designers, and students with open-source software tools that enable them to visually design new signals and easily integrate them into existing systems. This work also serves to motivate the need for further research in developing light behaviors for use in human-robot interaction. Towards this goal, we present our design rationale including a brief analysis of the signaling needs of several robots and applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "1111324", "output": "Based on the provided features, I've generated a title for the abstract.\n\n\"Approximating Piecewise Linear Functions with Constant Window Functions in Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy\"\n\nor\n\n\"Optimizing Constant Window Functions for Shape Rectangularization in IMRT Treatment Planning\"\n\nor\n\n\"Efficient Approximation of Piece", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Given a piecewise linear function f such that f(x)\u22650 for any x\u2208\u211d, the SR problems seek an optimal set of constant window functions to approximate f under a certain error criterion, such that the sum of the resulting constant window functions equals (or well approximates)\u00a0f. A\u00a0constant window function W(\u22c5) is defined on an interval I such that W(x) is a fixed value h0 for any x\u2208I and is 0 otherwise. A\u00a0constant window function can be viewed as a rectangle (or a\u00a0block) geometrically, or as a vector with the consecutive a\u2019s property combinatorially. The SR problems find applications in setup time and beam-on time minimization and dose simplification of the IMRT treatment planning process. We show that the SR problems are APX-Hard, and thus we aim to develop theoretically efficient and provably good quality approximation SR algorithms. Our main contribution is to present algorithms for a key SR problem that achieve approximation ratios better than\u00a02. For the general case, we give a $\\frac{24}{13}$ -approximation algorithm. For unimodal input curves, we give a $\\frac{9}{7}$ -approximation algorithm. We also consider other variants for which better approximation ratios are possible. We show that an important SR case that has been studied in medical literature can be formulated as a k-MST(k-minimum-spanning-tree) problem on a certain geometric graph G; based on a set of geometric observations and a non-trivial dynamic programming scheme, we are able to compute an optimal k-MST in G efficiently.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.18}, {"id": "1111325", "output": "Source Localization and Waveform Estimation for Multicore Beamformer Particle Filter-based Noninvasive Brain-Computer Interfaces\n\n<similarpairs>\nSource Localization and Waveform Estimation for Multicore Beamformer Particle Filter-based Noninvasive Brain-Computer Interfaces\nSource Localization and Waveform Estimation for Multicore Beam", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, correlated noises in EEG measurements still constitute a significant challenge. Alternatively, building BCIs based on filtered brain activity source signals instead of using their surface projections, obtained from the noisy EEG signals, is a promising and not well-explored direction. In this context, finding the locations and waveforms of inner brain sources represents a crucial task for advancing source-based noninvasive BCI technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel multicore beamformer particle filter (multicore BPF) to estimate the EEG brain source spatial locations and their corresponding waveforms. In contrast to conventional (single-core) beamforming spatial filters, the developed multicore BPF considers explicitly temporal correlation among the estimated brain sources by suppressing activation from regions with interfering coherent sources. The hybrid multicore BPF brings together the advantages of both deterministic and Bayesian inverse problem algorithms in order to improve the estimation accuracy. It solves the brain activity localization problem without prior information about approximate areas of source locations. Moreover, the multicore BPF reduces the dimensionality of the problem to half compared with the PF solution, thus alleviating the curse of dimensionality problem. The results, based on generated and real EEG data, show that the proposed framework recovers correctly the dominant sources of brain activity.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111326", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Optimization Techniques for Ensemble Classifier Design: A Comparative Study of Metaheuristic Methods and Traditional Ensemble Generators\"\n\nUsing similar abstract-title pairs from my past works:\n- \"A Comparative Study of Metaheuristic Optimization Techniques for Feature Selection in Ensemble Classifiers\"\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Additionally, the optimization techniques will also have to select members for heterogeneous ensembles, using -NN, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes as individual classifiers and they are all combined using the majority vote technique. The main aim of this study is to define which optimization techniques obtained the best results in the context of mono and multi-objective as well as to provide a comparison with classical ensemble techniques, such as bagging, boosting and random forest. Our findings indicated that three optimization techniques, Memetic, SA and PSO, provided better performance than the other optimization techniques as well as traditional ensemble generator (bagging, boosting and random forest).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111327", "output": "Fixed Cost k-Flow Problems: Approximation Results and Lower Bounds", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph H of G such that the minimum capacity of an st-cut in H is at least k. By an approximation-preserving reduction from Group Steiner Tree problem to Fixed Cost k-Flow, we obtain the first polylogarithmic lower bound for the problem; this also implies the first non-constant lower bounds for the Capacitated Steiner Network and Capacitated Multicommodity Flow problems. We then consider two special cases of Fixed Cost k-Flow. In the Bipartite Fixed-Cost k-Flow problem, we are given a bipartite graph G = (A B, E) and an integer k > 0. The goal is to find a node subset S \u2286 A B of minimum size |S| such G has k pairwise edge-disjoint paths between S A and S B. We give an O(klogk)$O(\\sqrt {k\\log k})$ approximation for this problem. We also show that we can compute a solution of optimum size with \u03a9(k/polylog(n)) paths, where n = |A| + |B|. In the Generalized-P2P problem we are given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with edge-costs and integer charges {bv : v V}. The goal is to find a minimum-cost spanning subgraph H of G such that every connected component of H has non-negative charge. This problem originated in a practical project for shift design [11]. Besides that, it generalizes many problems such as Steiner Forest, k-Steiner Tree, and Point to Point Connection. We give a logarithmic approximation algorithm for this problem. Finally, we consider a related problem called Connected Rent or Buy Multicommodity Flow and give a log3+ n approximation scheme for it using Group Steiner Tree techniques.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.34}, {"id": "1111328", "output": "Cache-Aware Iteration Space Scheduling for High-Performance Computing Systems\n\nor\n\nEfficient Partitioning of Parallel Loops for Multi-Core Systems: A Profile-Guided Approach\n\nor\n\nOptimizing Cache Behavior in Multi-Core Systems: A Novel Compiler Technique for Iteration Space Scheduling\n\nor\n\nVariation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Maximal exploitation of the hardware parallelism supported by such systems necessitates the development of concurrent software. This, in part, entails automatic parallelization of programs and efficient mapping of the parallelized program onto the different cores. The latter affects the load balance between the different cores which in turn has a direct impact on performance. In light of the fact that, parallel loops, such as a parallel DO loop in Fortran, account for a large percentage of the total execution time, we focus on the problem of how to efficiently partition the iteration space of (possibly) nested perfect/non-perfect parallel loops. In this regard, one of the key aspects is how to efficiently capture the cache behavior as the cache subsystem is often the main performance bottleneck in multi-core systems. In this paper, we present a novel profile-guided compiler technique for cache-aware scheduling of iteration spaces of such loops. Specifically, we propose a technique for iteration space scheduling which captures the effect of variation in the number of cache misses across the iteration space. Subsequently, we propose a general approach to capture the variation of both the number of cache misses and computation across the iteration space. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a dedicated 4-way Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae based multiprocessor using several kernels from the industry-standard SPEC CPU2000 and CPU2006 benchmarks achieving speedups upto 62.5%.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111329", "output": "\"Enabling Real-Time Information Sharing in Intelligent Transportation Systems through IoV and Multi-Layer Data Integration\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Some methods directly output the latent sharp image in one stage, while others utilize a multi-stage strategy (e.g. multi-scale, multi-patch, or multi-temporal) to gradually restore the sharp image. However, these methods have the following two main issues: 1) The computational cost of multi-stage is high; 2) The same convolution kernel is applied in different regions, which is not an ideal choice for non-uniform blur. Hence, non-uniform motion deblurring is still a challenging and open problem. In this paper, we propose a new architecture which consists of multiple Atrous Spatial Pyramid Deformable Convolution (ASPDC) modules to deblur an image end-to-end with more flexibility. Multiple ASPDC modules implicitly learn the pixel-specific motion with different dilation rates in the same layer to handle movements of different magnitude. To improve the training, we also propose a reblurring network to map the deblurred output back to the blurred input, which constrains the solution space. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Dong-Huo/ASPDC.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "1111331", "output": "High-Speed, Low-Latency, and Real-Time: Advancements in Event Camera Technology", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The AVA dataset densely annotates 80 atomic visual actions in 437 15-minute video clips, where actions are localized in space and time, resulting in 1.59M action labels with multiple labels per person occurring frequently. The key characteristics of our dataset are: (1) the definition of atomic visual actions, rather than composite actions; (2) precise spatio-temporal annotations with possibly multiple annotations for each person; (3) exhaustive annotation of these atomic actions over 15-minute video clips; (4) people temporally linked across consecutive segments; and (5) using movies to gather a varied set of action representations. This departs from existing datasets for spatio-temporal action recognition, which typically provide sparse annotations for composite actions in short video clips. AVA, with its realistic scene and action complexity, exposes the intrinsic difficulty of action recognition. To benchmark this, we present a novel approach for action localization that builds upon the current state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrates better performance on JHMDB and UCF101-24 categories. While setting a new state of the art on existing datasets, the overall results on AVA are low at 15.8% mAP, underscoring the need for developing new approaches for video understanding.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "1111333", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\nPuncturable Proxy Re-Encryption for Secure Group Messaging\nEfficient Puncturable Identity-Based Proxy Re-Encryption\nSelective Security in Puncturable Proxy Re-Encryption\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- Use of", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Nevertheless, the existing PPRE scheme not only suffers from the burden of certificate management but also merely achieves selective security based on the nonstandard assumption. In this article, a puncturable identity-based PRE (P-IB-PRE) scheme is proposed to efficiently protect the security and privacy of the group message. The proposed scheme introduces a message server as the proxy to transform ciphertext for each participant in the group; thus, the heavy computation overhead is delegated to the message server with abundant resources. Most importantly, our scheme enables the recipient to revoke its private key\u2019s decryption capability of the specific messages without affecting other messages. Moreover, the identity-based mechanism eliminates the burden of certificate management as well as improves efficiency. The proposed scheme achieves adaptive security under the standard decisional bilinear Diffie\u2013Hellman (DBDH) assumption. Eventually, theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed scheme has an excellent performance in efficiency and practicality.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111334", "output": "\"Enabling Efficient Exploration in Dynamic Partial Order Reduction through Conditional Independence Constraints\"\n\nor\n\n\"Conditional Independence Constraints for Efficient Concurrency Analysis in Dynamic Partial Order Reduction\"\n\nor\n\n\"Dynamic Partial Order Reduction with Conditional Independence Constraints for Reduced Exploration\"\n\nor\n\n\"Conditional Indpendence-Based Optimization for Dynamic Partial Order Reduction\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We present constrained dynamic partial order reduction (CDPOR), an extension of the DPOR framework which is able to avoid redundant explorations based on the notion of conditional inde- pendence the execution of p and t commutes only when certain independence constraints (ICs) are satisfied. ICs can be declared by the programmer, but importantly, we present a novel SMT-based approach to automatically synthesize ICs in a static pre-analysis. A unique feature of our approach is that we have succeeded to exploit ICs within the state-of-the-art DPOR algorithm, achieving exponential reductions over existing implementations.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.13}, {"id": "1111335", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Multilingual Threat Intelligence\", \"Cybersecurity Translation Challenges\", \"Language Barrier in OSINT Analysis\", \"Intelligent Cybersecurity Translation System\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- Use of keywords: \"multilingual\",", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

OSINT sources such as social media, blogs, and dark web vulnerability markets exist in diverse languages and hinder security analysts, who are unable to draw conclusions from intelligence in languages they don't understand. Although third party translation engines are growing stronger, they are unsuited for private security environments. First, sensitive intelligence is not a permitted input to third party engines due to privacy and confidentiality policies. In addition, third party engines produce generalized translations that tend to lack exclusive cybersecurity terminology. In this paper, we address these issues and describe our system that enables threat intelligence understanding across unfamiliar languages. We create a neural network based system that takes in cybersecurity data in a different language and outputs the respective English translation. The English translation can then be understood by an analyst, and can also serve as input to an AI based cyber-defense system that can take mitigative action. As a proof of concept, we have created a pipeline which takes Russian threats and generates its corresponding English, RDF, and vectorized representations. Our network optimizes translations on specifically, cybersecurity data.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111336", "output": "Wireless Virtual Reality Performance Evaluation: The Role of Terahertz Frequency Bands in Meeting High-Reliability Low-Latency Communication Requirements", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These QoE requirements can only be met by wireless connectivity that offers high-rate and high-reliability low-latency communications (HR2LLC), unlike the low rates commonly associated with ultrareliable low-latency communication. The high rates for VR over short distances can only be supported by an enormous bandwidth, available in the terahertz (THz)-frequency bands. To explore the potential of THz for meeting HR2LLC requirements, a quantification of the risk for an unreliable VR performance is conducted through a novel and rigorous characterization of the tail of the end-to-end (E2E) delay. Then, a thorough analysis of the Tail-Value-at-Risk (TVaR) is performed to concretely characterize the behavior of extreme wireless events crucial to the real-time VR experience. In particular, the probability distribution function of the THz transmission delay is derived and then used to infer the system reliability scenarios with guaranteed Line of Sight (LoS) as a function of THz network parameters. Numerical results show that abundant bandwidth and low molecular absorption are necessary to improve the reliability. However, their effect remains secondary compared to the availability of LoS, which significantly affects the THz HR2LLC performance. In particular, for scenarios with guaranteed LoS, a reliability of 99.999% (with an E2E delay threshold of 20 ms) for a bandwidth of 15 GHz along with data rates of 18.3 Gbps can be achieved by the THz network, compared to a reliability of 96% for twice the bandwidth, when blockages are considered.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "1111337", "output": "\"Cache-Efficient RNA Folding Algorithms: A Comparative Analysis of ByRow, ByRowSegment, and ByBox for Nussinov's Algorithm\"\n\nor\n\n\"Reducing Cache Misses in RNA Folding: A Study of ByRow, ByRowSegment, and ByBox Algorithms\"\n\nor\n\n\"Efficient RNA", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Several implementations of Nussinov's classical RNA folding algorithm have been proposed. Our focus is to obtain run time and energy efficiency by reducing the number of cache misses.Three cache-efficient algorithms, ByRow, ByRowSegment and ByBox, for Nussinov's RNA folding are developed. Using a simple LRU cache model, we show that the Classical algorithm of Nussinov has the highest number of cache misses followed by the algorithms Transpose (Li et al.), ByRow, ByRowSegment, and ByBox (in this order). Extensive experiments conducted on four computational platforms-Xeon E5, AMD Athlon 64 X2, Intel I7 and PowerPC A2-using two programming languages-C and Java-show that our cache efficient algorithms are also efficient in terms of run time and energy.Our benchmarking shows that, depending on the computational platform and programming language, either ByRow or ByBox give best run time and energy performance. The C version of these algorithms reduce run time by as much as 97.2% and energy consumption by as much as 88.8% relative to Classical and by as much as 56.3% and 57.8% relative to Transpose. The Java versions reduce run time by as much as 98.3% relative to Classical and by as much as 75.2% relative to Transpose. Transpose achieves run time and energy efficiency at the expense of memory as it takes twice the memory required by Classical. The memory required by ByRow, ByRowSegment, and ByBox is the same as that of Classical. As a result, using the same amount of memory, the algorithms proposed by us can solve problems up to 40% larger than those solvable by Transpose.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.18}, {"id": "1111338", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n  \"Therapeutic Exergames Design\", \"Safe Implementation of Exergames for Therapy\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n  keywords: \"therapeutic\", \"exergames\", \"methodology\", \"exercise", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Three main steps are identified. (I) A clear identification of all the exercise requirements, not only in terms of goals of the therapy, but also in terms of additional constraints. Characteristic parameters for determining the challenge level and to assess progression are also defined in this phase. (II) The exercise is transformed into a Virtual Exercise, in which all the exercise elements are implemented inside a simple virtual environment. In this step the discussion between clinical and ICT teams allows maximizing the effectiveness of exergames implementation. (III) The final exergame is realized by introducing on top of the exercise all the game elements suggested by good game design to maximize entertainment. A clear line between exercises and games is drawn here. We illustrate the methodology with exergames designed for (1) balance and posture and (2) neglect rehabilitation, implemented and tested with post-stroke patients training autonomously at home. The methodology can have a broader impact as it can be applied also in other gaming fields in which the requirements go beyond entertainment.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111339", "output": "Real-time Simulation and Control of Dexterous Human Activities with Volumetric Muscle Actuators and Trajectory Optimization", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We present the first controllable system in this class that incorporates volumetric muscle actuators, tightly coupled with the motion controller, in enhancement of line-segment approximations that prior art is overwhelmingly restricted to. The theoretical framework put forth by our methodology computes all the necessary Jacobians for control, even with the drastically increased dimensionality of the state descriptors associated with three-dimensional, volumetric muscles. The direct coupling of volumetric actuators in the controller allows us to model muscular deficiencies that manifest in shape and geometry, in ways that cannot be captured with line-segment approximations. Our controller is coupled with a trajectory optimization framework, and its efficacy is demonstrated in complex motion tasks such as juggling, and weightlifting sequences with variable anatomic parameters and interaction constraints.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "1111340", "output": "\"Unlocking the Taxonomic Structure of Mixed Microbial Communities through Target-Based Metagenomics and Meta-barcoding: Challenges and Opportunities in Advanced Bioinformatic Analysis\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For example, it can recommend the user to go to a specific restaurant (item) and also order some specific foods there, e.g., seafood (an aspect of consumption). Our method is called Sentiment Utility Logistic Model (SULM). As its name suggests, SULM uses sentiment analysis of user reviews. It first predicts the sentiment that the user may have about the item based on what he/she might express about the aspects of the item and then identifies the most valuable aspects of the user's potential experience with that item. Furthermore, the method can recommend items together with those most important aspects over which the user has control and can potentially select them, such as the time to go to a restaurant, e.g. lunch vs. dinner, and what to order there, e.g., seafood. We tested the proposed method on three applications (restaurant, hotel, and beauty & spa) and experimentally showed that those users who followed our recommendations of the most valuable aspects while consuming the items, had better experiences, as defined by the overall rating.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111346", "output": "Automatic sound event recognition (SER) with Visual Enhancements for Real-World Environments\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Automatic sound event recognition (SER) with Visual Enhancements for Real-World Environments\", \"A Novel Approach to Real-World Sound Event Recognition Using Audio-Visual Descriptors\"],\n[\"Automatic sound event recognition", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, visualizing such AMR data poses a significant challenge due to the difficulties introduced by the hierarchical representation when reconstructing continuous field values. In this paper, we detail a comprehensive solution for interactive isosurface rendering of block-structured AMR data. We contribute a novel reconstruction strategy the octant method which is continuous. adaptive and simple to implement. Furthermore. we present a generally applicable hybrid implicit isosurface ray-tracing method, which provides better rendering quality and performance than the built-in sampling-based approach in OSPRay. Finally, we integrate our octant method and hybrid isosurface geometry into OSPRay as a module, providing the ability to create high-quality interactive visualizations combining volume and isosurface representations of BS-AMR data. We evaluate the rendering performance. memory consumption and quality of our method on two gigascale block-structured AMR datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111350", "output": "\"Detecting Semantic Clones in Ethereum Smart Contracts: A Novel Approach Utilizing Smart Contract Birthmarks\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Everyone is allowed to develop and deploy smart contracts. Such flexibility can lead to a large collection of similar contracts, i.e., clones, especially when Ethereum applications are highly domain-specific and may share similar functionalities within the same domain, e.g., token contracts often provide interfaces for money transfer and balance inquiry. While smart contract clones have a wide range of impact across different applications, e.g., security, they are relatively little studied.\n\nAlthough clone detection has been a long-standing research topic, blockchain smart contracts introduce new challenges, e.g., syntactic diversity due to trade-off between storage and execution, understanding high-level business logic etc.. In this paper, we highlighted the very first attempt to clone detection of Ethereum smart contracts. To overcome the new challenges, we introduce the concept of smart contract birthmark, i.e., a semantic-preserving and computable representation for smart contract bytecode. The birthmark captures high-level semantics by effectively sketching symbolic execution traces (e.g., data access dependencies, path conditions) and maintain syntactic regularities (e.g., type and number of instructions) as well. Then, the clone detection problem is reduced to a computation of statistical similarity between two contract birthmarks. We have implemented a clone detector called EClone and evaluated it on Ethereum. The empirical results demonstrated the potential of EClone in accurately identifying clones. We have also extended EClone for vulnerability search and managed to detect CVE-2018-10376 instances.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "1111351", "output": "\"Lung Lobe Segmentation in COPD Patients: An Automatic Approach via Iterative B-Spline Fitting\"\n\nor\n\n\"Lobectomy in COPD Diagnosis: Improving Accuracy through B-Spline Based Fissure Detection\"\n\nor\n\n\"Automated Lung Segmentation for COPD Patients: Enhancing Fissure", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The method enhances fissures, removes unlikely fissure candidates, after which a B-spline is fitted iteratively through the remaining candidate objects. The iterative fitting approach circumvents the need to classify each object as being part of the fissure or being noise, and allows the fissure to be detected in multiple disconnected parts. This property is beneficial for good performance in patient data, containing incomplete and disease-affected fissures. The proposed algorithm is tested on 22 COPD patients, resulting in accurate lobe-based densitometry, and a median overlap of the fissure (defined 3 voxels wide) with an expert ground truth of 0.65, 0.54 and 0.44 for the three main fissures. This compares to complete lobe overlaps of 0.99, 0.98, 0.98, 0.97 and 0.87 for the five main lobes, showing promise for lobe segmentation on data of patients with moderate to severe COPD.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111352", "output": "Based on the provided abstract, I will generate a title using the similar abstract-title pairs from my past works and the features on word usage and sentence formulation.\n\nTitle: Efficient Picture Pattern Matching via Networks of Picture Processors", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The network solving the problem can be informally described as follows: it consists of two subnetworks, one of them extracts at each step, simultaneously, all subpictures of identical (progressively decreasing) size from the input picture and sends them to the other subnetwork which checks whether any of the received pictures is identical to the pattern. We present an efficient solution based on networks with evolutionary processors only, for patterns with at most three rows or columns. Afterward, we present a solution based on networks containing both evolutionary and hiding processors running in ({mathcal {O}}(n+m+kl)) computational (processing and communication) steps, for any size (n, m) of the input picture and (k, l) of the pattern. From the proofs of these results, we infer that any (k, l)-local language with (1le kle 3) can be decided in ({mathcal {O}}(n+m+l)) computational steps by networks with evolutionary processors only, while any (k, l)-local language with arbitrary k, l can be decided in ({mathcal {O}}(n+m+kl)) computational steps by networks containing both evolutionary and hiding processors.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.82}, {"id": "1111353", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Style Control for Synthetic Singing Voices\", \"Singing Style Modulation using Hidden Semi-Markov Models\", \"Controlling Singing Style and Intensity in Synthetic Voices\"\n</similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n- Use", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In the proposed technique, singing styles and their intensities are represented by low-dimensional vectors called style vectors and are modeled in accordance with the assumption that mean parameters of acoustic models are given as multiple regressions of the style vectors. In the synthesis process, we can weaken or emphasize the intensities of singing styles by setting a desired style vector. In addition, the idea of pitch adaptive training is extended to the case of the MRHSMM to improve the modeling accuracy of pitch associated with musical notes. A novel vibrato modeling technique is also presented to extract vibrato parameters from singing voices that sometimes have unclear vibrato expressions. Subjective evaluations show that we can intuitively control singing styles and their intensities while maintaining the naturalness of synthetic singing voices comparable to the conventional HSMM-based singing voice synthesis.

Applications that react to environment stimuli are implemented by communicating sporadic and periodic tasks, programmed independently from an execution platform. Two functionally equivalent semantics are defined, one for sequential execution and one real-time. The former ensures functional determinism by implying precedence constraints between jobs (task executions), hence, the program outputs are independent from the task scheduling. The latter specifies concurrent execution on a real-time platform, guaranteeing all model\u2019s constraints; it has been implemented in an executable formal specification language. The model\u2019s implementation runs on multi-core embedded systems, and supports integration of run-time managers for shared HW/SW resources (e.g. for controlling QoS, resource interference or power consumption). Finally, a model transformation approach has been developed, which allowed to port and statically schedule a real spacecraft on-board application on an industrial multi-core platform.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111355", "output": "\"Overcoming Limitations of Traditional Statistical Methods in Clinical Data Analysis: A Data Mining Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Addressing Shortcomings of Regression Analysis and Hypothesis Testing in Medical Studies: A Data Mining Solution\"\n\nor\n\n\"Data Mining Techniques for Enhancing Clinical Data Analysis: Mitigating Limitations of Traditional Statistical", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although such traditional techniques are wildly used, they have several shortcomings. For example, when analyzing datasets with a large number of temporal attributes, domain experts often miss important associative attributes in regression analysis because of the large number of correlated attributes. On the other hand, for rare occurring diseases or operations, the number of documented observed cases is usually small, and hypothesis testing becomes ineffective for such analysis due to insufficient statistical significance. We shall present two such case studies to showcase how data mining techniques [1-7] can be used to remedy such shortcomings.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111356", "output": "Based on the provided abstract and features, I generate the title:\n\n\"Graph Analysis with SQL: Unveiling Hidden Patterns and Statistics\"\n\nor alternatively:\n\n\"SQL-based Graph Analysis: Efficient Exploration and Discovery of Graph Properties\"\n\nor another option:\n\n\"Unlocking Graph Insights: Leveraging SQL for Flexible and Efficient Graph Analysis\"\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In general, the goal is to summarize the graph and discover interesting patterns hidden in the graph. On the other hand, there is a lot of data stored on DBMSs that can be potentially analyzed as graphs. External graph data sets can be quickly loaded. It is feasible to load data quickly and that SQL can help prepare graph data sets from raw data. In this paper, we show SQL queries on a graph stored in relational form as triples can reveal many interesting properties and patterns on the graph in a more flexible manner and efficient than existing systems. We explain many interesting statistics on the graph can be derived with queries combining joins and aggregations. On the other hand, linearly recursive queries can summarize interesting patterns including reachability, paths, and connected components. We experimentally show exploratory queries can be efficiently evaluated based on the input edges and it performs better than Spark. We also show that skewed degree vertices, cycles and cliques are the main reason exploratory queries become slow.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111357", "output": "\"Unlocking Access to Restricted Digital Content: Advances in the HathiTrust Research Center Data Capsule Service\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Because of these limitations, computational analysis on the HTDL must either be carried out in a secure environment or on derivative datasets. The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) Data Capsule service provides researchers with a secure environment through which they invoke tools that create, analyze, and export non-consumptive datasets. These derivative datasets, so long as they do not reproduce the full-text of the original work, are a transformative work protected by Fair Use provisions of United States Copyright Law, and can be published for reuse by other researchers, as the HTRC Extracted Features Dataset has been. Secure environments and derivative datasets enable researchers to engage with restricted data from focused studies of a few dozen volumes to large-scale experiments on millions of volumes. This paper describes advances in the Capsule service through a case study of how the HTRC Data Capsule service has advanced our activities on provenance, workflows, worksets, and non-consumptive exports through a topic modeling example. We also discuss the potential applications of this Capsule-based model to other digital libraries wrestling with research access and copyright restrictions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.65}, {"id": "1111358", "output": "Constructing and Deploying Mobile Applications with NitroGen: A Time-Efficient Approach to Enterprise Development", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our method trains an RNN-based neural network architecture to solve multiple view inter-prediction tasks for each shape. Given several nearby views of a shape, we define view inter-prediction as the task of predicting the center view between the input views, and reconstructing the input views in a low-level feature space. The key idea of our approach is to implement the shape representation as a shape-specific global memory that is shared between all local view inter-predictions for each shape. Intuitively, this memory enables the system to aggregate information that is useful to better solve the view inter-prediction tasks for each shape, and to leverage the memory as a view-independent shape representation. Our approach obtains the best results using a combination of L-2 and adversarial losses for the view inter-prediction task. We show that VIP-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised 3D feature learning on three large-scale 3D shape benchmarks.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.49}, {"id": "1111360", "output": "Transform-Aware Attention for Real-Time Visual Tracking via Spatial Transform Parameters", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we present a transform-aware attentive tracking framework, which uses a deep attentive network to directly predict the target states via spatial transform parameters. During off-line training, the proposed network learns generic motion patterns of target objects from auxiliary large-scale videos. These leaned motion patterns are then applied to track target objects on test sequences. Built on the Spatial Transform Network (STN), the proposed attentive network is fully differentiable and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Notably, we only fine-tune the pre-trained network in the initial frame. The proposed tracker requires neither online model update nor appearance sampling during the tracking process. Extensive experiments on OTB-2013, OTB-2015, VOT-2014 and UAV-123 datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method against state-of-the-art attentive tracking methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.29}, {"id": "1111361", "output": "Uncertainty Quantification in Image Segmentation: A Comparative Study of Fuzzy Set Theory and Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set Theory", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

On one hand, pull-based engines can achieve higher throughput because their workloads are read-dominant, rather than write-dominant, and can proceed without synchronization between threads. On the other hand, push-based engines are much better able to take advantage of the frontier optimization, which leverages the fact that often only a small subset of the graph needs to be accessed to complete an iteration of a graph processing application. Hybrid engines attempt to overcome this trade-off by dynamically switching between push and pull, but there are two key disadvantages with this approach. First, applications must be implemented twice (once for push and once for pull), and second, processing throughput is reduced for iterations that run with push.  propose a radically different solution: rebuild the frontier optimization entirely such that it is well-suited for a pull-based engine. In doing so, we remove the only advantage that a push-based engine had over a pull-based engine, making it possible to eliminate the push-based engine entirely. We introduce Wedge, a pull-only graph processing framework that transforms the traditional source-oriented vertex-based frontier into a pull-friendly format called the Wedge Frontier. The transformation itself is expensive even when parallelized, so we introduce two key optimizations to make it practical. First, we perform the transformation only when the resulting Wedge Frontier is sufficiently sparse. Second, we coarsen the granularity of the representation of elements in the Wedge Frontier. These optimizations respectively improve Wedgeu0027s performance by up to 5x and 2x, enabling it to outperform Grazelle, Ligra, and GraphMat respectively by up to 2.8x, 4.9x, and 185.5x.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "1111363", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Optimizing Interference Alignment in Time-Varying Wireless Channels via Maximum Doppler Frequency Estimation\"\n\nor \n\n\"Maximizing Average Capacity in Interference Alignment using Maximum Doppler Frequency Information\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As alignment of interference requires tight coupling to estimates of the channel, time variations in the channel lead to loss of capacity since estimates take time to make and communicate. Thus, the length of the data and training phase should be appropriately chosen so as to maximise the average capacity. In this paper we present a way to model the sum capacity achieved by interference alignment in a time varying wireless channel and show that in slowly changing channels, it is possible to maximise the average capacity using just the knowledge of the maximum Doppler frequency of the interferers. For a given training duration, We select the data phase duration to maximise the average capacity and show that our predicted average capacity strongly tracks the true average capacity using the optimized data phase duration. In high Doppler scenarios, we do not see a benefit from our scheme because the channel capacity has high variance and a first order description is no longer sufficient. We further propose that the receiver can adapt its beamweights using a least-squares technique and approach the instantaneous sum capacity of interference alignment.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.98}, {"id": "1111364", "output": "Characterization of Long-term Activity-Dependent Plasticity from Behaviorally Driven Spiking Activity", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this letter, we present a computational framework for quantifying spike-timing-dependent plasticity STDP during behavior by identifying a functional plasticity rule solely from spiking activity. First, we formulate a flexible point-process spiking neuron model structure with STDP, which includes functions that characterize the stationary and plastic properties of the neuron. The STDP model includes a novel function for prolonged plasticity induction, as well as a more typical function for synaptic weight change based on the relative timing of input-output spike pairs. Consideration for system stability is incorporated with weight-dependent synaptic modification. Next, we formalize an estimation technique using a generalized multilinear model GMLM structure with basis function expansion. The weight-dependent synaptic modification adds a nonlinearity to the model, which is addressed with an iterative unconstrained optimization approach. Finally, we demonstrate successful model estimation on simulated spiking data and show that all model functions can be estimated accurately with this method across a variety of simulation parameters, such as number of inputs, output firing rate, input firing type, and simulation time. Since this approach requires only naturally generated spikes, it can be readily applied to behaving animal studies to characterize the underlying mechanisms of learning and memory.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111365", "output": "Measuring Body Deformation of Soft Robots via Chromatic Surface Micro-Structure (CSM) Films and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) Actuators", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Firstly, the CSM films are fabricated by diffraction gratings mold using material polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Then, the CSM films are attached to the surface of the soft actuators based on shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. By recording and matching the pattern through two cameras, the continuous deformation curvature degrees of SMA soft actuators are attained. Finally, by integrating three actuators mentioned previously, a bio-inspired prototype of three-legged soft robot is manufactured to carry out motions of both freely and grasp obstacles. By recording and matching the pattern of the robot, we demonstrated a non-contact deformation measurement for flexible devices. As a new non-contact measurement method for body deformation of soft robots, it may shed some light on the issues of the soft robotsu0027 sensing and controlling in the future.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "1111366", "output": "\"Assessing Technical Lag in Docker Containers: A Comparative Analysis of Software Package Vulnerabilities and Bugs in Debian-based Images\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Docker images are one of the most popular container technologies for building and deploying containers. A container image usually includes a collection of software packages, that can have bugs and security vulnerabilities that affect the container health. Our goal is to support container deployers by analysing the relation between outdated containers and vulnerable and buggy packages installed in them. We use the concept of technical lag of a container as the difference between a given container and the most up-to-date container that is possible with the most recent releases of the same collection of packages. For 7,380 official and community Docker images that are based on the Debian Linux distribution, we identify which software packages are installed in them and measure their technical lag in terms of version updates, security vulnerabilities and bugs. We have found, among others, that no release is devoid of vulnerabilities, so deployers cannot avoid vulnerabilities even if they deploy the most recent packages. We offer some lessons learned for container developers in regard to the strategies they can follow to minimize the number of vulnerabilities. We argue that Docker container scan and security management tools should improve their platforms by adding data about other kinds of bugs and include the measurement of technical lag to offer deployers information of when to update.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "1111367", "output": "Robust Person Re-Identification with Online Co-Refining Frameworks for Handling Noisy Labels\n\n<similarpairs>\nRobust Person Re-Identification with Online Co-Refining Frameworks for Handling Noisy Labels\nRobust Person Re-Identification with Joint Self-Label Refining Strategies\nRobust Person Re-", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, label noise is unavoidable due to inaccurate person detection results or annotation errors in real scenes. It is extremely challenging to learn a robust Re-ID model with label noise since each identity has very limited annotated training samples. To avoid fitting to the noisy labels, we propose to learn a prefatory model using a large learning rate at the early stage with a self-label refining strategy, in which the labels and network are jointly optimized. To further enhance the robustness, we introduce an online co-refining (CORE) framework with dynamic mutual learning, where networks and label predictions are online optimized collaboratively by distilling the knowledge from other peer networks. Moreover, it also reduces the negative impact of noisy labels using a favorable selective consistency strategy. CORE has two primary advantages: it is robust to different noise types and unknown noise ratios; it can be easily trained without much additional effort on the architecture design. Extensive experiments on Re-ID and image classification demonstrate that CORE outperforms its counterparts by a large margin under both practical and simulated noise settings. Notably, it also improves the state-of-the-art unsupervised Re-ID performance under standard settings.

Inverted list compression is also a well-studied topic in the information retrieval community and many inverted list compression algorithms were developed as well, e.g., VB, PforDelta, GroupVB, Simple8b, and SIMDPforDelta. We observe that they essentially solve the same problem, i.e., how to store a collection of sorted integers with as few as possible bits and support query processing as fast as possible. Due to historical reasons, bitmap compression and inverted list compression were developed as two separated lines of research in the database area and information retrieval area. Thus, a natural question is: Which one is better between bitmap compression and inverted list compression? To answer the question, we present the first comprehensive experimental study to compare a series of 9 bitmap compression methods and 12 inverted list compression methods. We compare these 21 algorithms on synthetic datasets with different distributions (uniform, zipf, and markov) as well as 8 real-life datasets in terms of the space overhead, decompression time, intersection time, and union time. Based on the results, we provide many lessons and guidelines that can be used for practitioners to decide which technique to adopt in future systems and also for researchers to develop new algorithms.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111371", "output": "\"Advancing Many-Objective Software Engineering: Current State and Future Directions in the Era of Advanced Search Methods\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We find that highly time-correlated Wi-Fi signal measures experience less variation in their received signal strength (RSS), which alleviates the impediment of the RSS-based solution. We also notice that each room observes significantly discrete signal signature even when they are adjacent to each other. We leverage these observations and rely on the RSS measure to detect and unobtrusively pair devices in the same space. To achieve our goal, we devise a new similarity metric for RSS comparison and propose a means of selecting the cluster threshold. We implement a prototype named Flock for Android devices.

In these networks, proper utilization of network resources is desirable to maintain Quality of Service (QoS). In multi-hop end-to-end communication, intermediate nodes may eavesdrop on data in transit. As a result, a secured and reliable data delivery from source to destination is required. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, known as QASEC, to achieve better throughput by securing end-to-end communication in MANETs. The QoS is maintained through an optimal link selection from a queue of available transmission links. The end-to-end communication is secured by authentication. A simple secret-key based symmetric encryption is deployed for interacting nodes. Our proposed QASEC scheme prevents the malicious nodes from data exchange with legitimate intermediate nodes on any established path between the source and the destination. Experimental results show that QASEC performs better in terms of packet-loss rate, jitter and end-to-end delay. Furthermore, QASEC is efficient against various attacks and has a much better performance in terms of associated costs, such as key generation, encryption, and storage and communication.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111374", "output": "Parameter Identification and Finite-Time Estimation for Single Sinusoidal Signals Using Homogeneous System Theory and Power Integrator Technique", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Cloud computing has been considered as an appropriate environment for telecommunication services. However, more threats appear in the migration of applications and telecommunication services from a traditional computing environment to a cloud platform. Traditional device-centric security systems are not effective as resources in the cloud are out of the users control. Data storage and processing for a telecommunication service in the cloud can be structured as a data service in PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) level. Upper-level applications exchange data with the data service. In this paper, we propose a domain-divided security model in which different security policies are separately applied for three domains: the data storage domain, the data processing domain and the data transmission domain. In addition, security policies can be configured for upper-level applications based on their security requirements. Experimental results show that our proposed security model is both practical and lightweight as it can provide differentiated security protection for cloud computing-based telecommunication service with a low overhead.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111376", "output": "\"Optimizing Patch Timing in Intrusion Tolerant Systems via Stochastic Reward Nets and Phase-Type Approximation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Timing Optimization for Pull-Type Patch Management in ITS via Composite SRNs and MRGP Models\"\n\nor\n\n\"Analyzing System Availability in Pull-Type Patch Management using Stochastic Reward Nets and PH", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We consider a scenario where sensors are randomly dropped on a bidimensional field in order to detect target traversals which occur in a stochastic way within a critical mission time. Once a target enters a sensor's detection area, the sensor transmits such information to a cluster head, in charge of receiving and retransmitting the messages received from the sensors deployed on the field. The contribution of this work is fourfold. We first identify the sensing nodes whose behavior is key to model the duration of sensing operations, assuming prior arrival and mobility models for target traversals. We then proceed, providing a heuristic estimation of the traffic received by the cluster head to quantify its energy requirements, resorting to specific lifetime definitions. We also evaluate the relationship between our probabilistic and heuristic models and the time until the barrier remains capable of detecting and reporting the traversal of any target to a sink, as obtained by simulation. Finally, we show how the lifetime of such network may be shaped, with the use of a sequential activation mechanism, for example to combat the traversals of adversaries exploiting the lifetime models obtained in this work.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111379", "output": "Robust Low-Rank Matrix Recovery via Subgradient Method: A Factored Representation Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We consider a nonsmooth nonconvex formulation of the problem, in which we explicitly enforce the low-rank property of the solution by using a factored representation of the matrix variable and employ an l(1)-loss function to robustify the solution against outliers. We show that even when a constant fraction (which can be up to almost half) of the measurements are arbitrarily corrupted, as long as certain measurement operators arising from the measurement model satisfy the so-called l(1)/l(2)-restricted isometry property, the ground-truth matrix can be exactly recovered from any global minimum of the resulting optimization problem. Furthermore, we show that the objective function of the optimization problem is sharp and weakly convex. Consequently, a subgradient method (SubGM) with geometrically diminishing step sizes will converge linearly to the ground-truth matrix when suitably initialized. We demonstrate the efficacy of the SubGM for the nonconvex robust low-rank matrix recovery problem with various numerical experiments.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.37}, {"id": "1111380", "output": "Real-time Spectral Unmixing using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays: A Novel FPGA-Based Implementation of Maximum Simplex Volume Algorithm", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Since more hyperspectral applications now require real or near real-time processing capabilities, fast spectral unmixing using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has received considerable interest in recent years. FPGAs can provide onboard, high computing performance at low power consumption. Another important characteristic of FPGA-based systems is reconfigurability, which makes them more flexible to process different kind of scenes. Pure signature (endmember) extraction is a fundamental step in spectral unmixing, which has been tackled using the maximum volume principle by several algorithms, most notably N-FINDR and simplex growing algorithm (SGA). These algorithms find out the simplex with maximum volume as a mechanism to extract endmembers. However, a previous dimensionality reduction step is generally required, which introduces information loss and additional computational burden. To address these issues, in this work we introduce a new volume calculation formula and further develop a new real-time implementation of a maximum simplex volume algorithm (called RT-MSVA). The proposed RT-MSVA does not need dimensionality reduction, so all spectral bands can be used without losing any information to ensure robust endmember extraction accuracy. Experiments with synthetic and real hyperspectral images have been conducted to evaluate the accuracy and computational performance of our proposed method. Our experimental results indicate that proposed FPGA-based implementation significantly outperforms the corresponding software version and achieves real-time processing performance in the considered problem. It also exhibits better endmember extraction accuracy and comparable performance to other available techniques, such as a real-time implementation of a simplex growing algorithm (RT-FSGA).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "1111381", "output": "Human Gait Recognition: A Novel Approach for Enhanced Identification Under Varying Conditions Using MLBP and Gabor Filter Bank Features", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This paper proposes a novel gait recognition approach capable of selecting information characteristics for human identification under different conditions including normal walking, carrying a bag and wearing a clothing for different angles of view; thereby enhancing the recognition accomplishment. The proposed approach relies on two feature extraction methods based on multi-scale feature descriptors including Multi-scale Local Binary Pattern (MLBP) and Gabor filter bank, through Spectra Regression Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SRKDA) reduction algorithm. The proposed features are extracted locally from two Region of Interest (ROIs) representing the dynamic areas in the Gait Energy Image (GEI). The experiments conducted on CASIA and USF Gait databases have shown that the suggested methods achieve better recognition performances up to 92% in terms of identification rate at rank-1 than the existing similar and recent state-of-the-art methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111382", "output": "\"Edge Intelligence: A Decentralized Approach to Enhanced Data Processing and Enhanced Data Privacy in Proximity to Data Capture\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Existing IoT applications transmit the data to resource-rich data centers for analytics. However, it may congest networks, overload data centers, and increase security vulnerability. In this paper, we implement a platform, which integrates resources from data centers (servers) to end devices (IoT devices). We launch distributed analytics applications among the devices without sending everything to the data centers. We analyze challenges to implement such a platform and carefully adopt popular open-source projects to overcome the challenges. We then conduct comprehensive experiments on the implemented platform. The results show: (i) the benefits/limitations of distributed analytics, (ii) the importance of decisions on distributing an application across multiple devices, and (iii) the overhead caused by different components in our platform.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111385", "output": "\"Assessing the Resilience of GOST Block Ciphers Against Differential Attacks: A Retrospective Analysis of 40 Years of Development\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Instead, users can express their information needs by simply asking their questions in natural language (NL). Datasets used to train KGQA models that would provide such a service are expensive to construct, both in terms of expert and crowdsourced labor. Typically, crowdsourced labor is used to improve template-based pseudo-natural questions generated from formal queries. However, the resulting datasets often fall short of representing genuinely natural and fluent language. In the present work, we investigate ways to characterize and remedy these shortcomings. We create the IQN-KGQA test collection by sampling questions from existing KGQA datasets and evaluating them with regards to five different aspects of naturalness. Then, the questions are rewritten to improve their fluency. Finally, the performance of existing KGQA models is compared on the original and rewritten versions of the NL questions. We find that some KGQA systems fare worse when presented with more realistic formulations of NL questions. The IQN-KGQA test collection is a resource to help evaluate KGQA systems in a more realistic setting. The construction of this test collection also sheds light on the challenges of constructing large-scale KGQA datasets with genuinely NL questions.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "1111387", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.

In-situ sensing could enable just-in-time stress management interventions. We present the first work to detect stress using the movements of a car's existing steering wheel. We extend prior work on PC peripherals and demonstrate that stress, expressed through muscle tension in the limbs, can be measured through the way we drive a car. We collected data in a driving simulator under controlled circumstances to vary the levels of induced stress, within subjects. We analyze angular displacement data to estimate coefficients related to muscle tension using an inverse filtering technique. We prove that the damped frequency of a mass spring damper model representing the arm is significantly higher during stress. Stress can be detected with only a few turns during driving. We validate these measures against a known stressor and calibrate our sensor against known stress measurements.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.02}, {"id": "1111388", "output": "\"Epsilon-Group Differential Privacy: Protecting Sensitive Information of Groups at Defined Privacy Levels\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Such schemes fail to support group privacy where aggregate information about a group of individuals may also be sensitive and users of the published data may have different levels of access privileges entitled to them. We propose the notion of epsilon(g)-Group Differential Privacy that protects sensitive information of groups of individuals at various defined privacy levels, enabling data users to obtain the level of access entitled to them. We present a preliminary evaluation of the proposed notion of group privacy through experiments on real association graph data that demonstrate the guarantees on group privacy on the disclosed data.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "1111389", "output": "Optimizing Nonlinear Equation Systems via Multiobjective Transformation and Decomposition: A Pareto-Optimal Solution Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The main task of solving nonlinear equation systems is to simultaneously locate these optimal solutions in a single run. When solving nonlinear equation systems by evolutionary algorithms, usually a nonlinear equation system should be transformed into a kind of optimization problem. At present, various transformation techniques have been proposed. This paper presents a simple and generic transformation technique based on multiobjective optimization for nonlinear equation systems. Unlike the previous work, our transformation technique transforms a nonlinear equation system into a biobjective optimization problem that can be decomposed into two parts. The advantages of our transformation technique are twofold: 1) all the optimal solutions of a nonlinear equation system are the Pareto optimal solutions of the transformed problem, which are mapped into diverse points in the objective space, and 2) multiobjective evolutionary algorithms can be directly applied to handle the transformed problem. In order to verify the effectiveness of our transformation technique, it has been integrated with nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II to solve nonlinear equation systems. The experimental results have demonstrated that, overall, our transformation technique outperforms another state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization based transformation technique and four single-objective optimization based approaches on a set of test instances. The influence of the types of Pareto front on the performance of our transformation technique has been investigated empirically. Moreover, the limitation of our transformation technique has also been identified and discussed in this paper.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "1111390", "output": "Designing Reliable 3D Power-Delivery Networks for Monolithic 3D Integration: A Genetic Programming Approach to Mitigate Power-Supply Noise and Yield Loss", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the design of a reliable M3D power-delivery network (PDN) is challenging due to high power density and current demand per unit area. We propose a framework to design a reliable PDN for M3D ICs using accurate electrical and reliability models. We leverage genetic programming to explore the design space to optimize the PDN for M3D. We also analyze power-supply noise (PSN) during scan-based testing and compare it with that observed during functional operation. We quantify the impact of PSN during scan-based testing on yield loss. Our results show that the PDN obtained using the proposed approach significantly increases the reliability of at least 40% of the wire segments in the PDN. In addition, the proposed PDN design reduces the worst-case power-supply droop by 50.5% compared to a baseline PDN. The yield loss due to power-supply droop for the proposed design is also significantly lower compared to the baseline.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.63}, {"id": "1111391", "output": "Boolean Pythagorean Triples Problem Formalization and Verification in Coq.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We verify Heule et al.\u2019s proof by showing that the symmetry breaks they introduced to simplify the propositional formula are sound, and by implementing a correct-by-construction checker for proofs of unsatisfiability based on reverse unit propagation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.33}, {"id": "1111392", "output": "Semantic Reconstruction of Rational Closure in Description Logics: A Minimal Models Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Then we extend the whole formalism and semantics to Description Logics, by focusing our attention to the standard ALC: we first naturally adapt to Description Logics Lehman and Magidor's propositional rational closure, starting from an extension of ALC with a typicality operator T that selects the most typical instances of a concept C (hence T(C) stands for typical C). Then, for the Description Logics, we define a minimal model semantics for the logic ALC and we show that it provides a semantic characterization for the rational closure of a Knowledge base. We consider both the rational closure of the TBox and the rational closure of the ABox.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.31}, {"id": "1111393", "output": "\"Automated Synthesis of Personal Handwriting Fonts with Large Character Sets via Style Learning from Small-Sample Datasets\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For example, the official standard GB18030-2000 for commercial font products consists of 27,533 Chinese characters. Consistently and correctly writing out such huge amounts of characters is usually an impossible mission for ordinary people. To solve this problem, we propose a system, EasyFont, to automatically synthesize personal handwriting for all (e.g., Chinese) characters in the font library by learning style from a small number (as few as 1%) of carefully-selected samples written by an ordinary person. Major technical contributions of our system are twofold. First, we design an effective stroke extraction algorithm that constructs best-suited reference data from a trained font skeleton manifold and then establishes correspondence between target and reference characters via a non-rigid point set registration approach. Second, we develop a set of novel techniques to learn and recover users\u2019 overall handwriting styles and detailed handwriting behaviors. Experiments including Turing tests with 97 participants demonstrate that the proposed system generates high-quality synthesis results, which are indistinguishable from original handwritings. Using our system, for the first time, the practical handwriting font library in a user\u2019s personal style with arbitrarily large numbers of Chinese characters can be generated automatically. It can also be observed from our experiments that recently-popularized deep learning based end-to-end methods are not able to properly handle this task, which implies the necessity of expert knowledge and handcrafted rules for many applications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111394", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Cloud-Scale Auto-Scaling for Meshed Web Systems\",\n\"Hybrid State-Space-Model-and-Queuing-Network Based Feedback Control for Scalable Cloud Infrastructure\",\n\"State-Space-Model Based Static Feedback", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Cloud computing platforms provide elastic computing capacities for these meshed Web systems to guarantee Service Level Agreement (SLA). Though workloads of meshed Web systems usually change steadily and periodically in total, sometimes there are sudden fluctuations. In this paper, a hybrid State-space-model-and-Queuing-network based Feedback control method (SQF) is developed for auto-scaling Virtual Machines (VMs) allocated to each tier of meshed Web systems. For the case with workloads changing steadily, a State-space-model based static Feedback Control method (SFC) is proposed in SQF to stabilize request response times near the reference time. For unsteadily changing workloads, a Queuing-network based multi-tier collaborative Feedback Control method (QFC) is proposed for effectively eliminating bottlenecks. QFC builds a control system for each tier individually and uses the queuing network to measure the interaction relationships among different tiers. Experimental results show that QFC is able to improve the efficiency of eliminating bottlenecks (decreasing upper-limit SLA violation ratios by 31.99%\n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n56.52%) with similar or a little bit high VM rental costs compared to existing methods while SFC obtains more stable response times for requests with reasonable additional costs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111395", "output": "\"Beyond Bayesian Network Induction: Efron's Bootstrap for Confidence Measures and Improved Structure Discovery in Limited Data Settings\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, in complex data analysis problems, we need to go beyond being satisfied with inducing networks with high scores. We need to provide confidence measures on features of these networks: Is the existence of an edge between two nodes warranted? Is the Markov blanket of a given node robust? Can we say something about the ordering of the variables? We should be able to address these questions, even when the amount of data is not enough to induce a high scoring network. In this paper we propose Efron's Bootstrap as a computationally efficient approach for answering these questions. In addition, we propose to use these confidence measures to induce better structures from the data, and to detect the presence of latent variables.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "1111396", "output": "\"Unveiling Entity Dynamics: A Novel Dataset and Models for Inferring Causal Effects in Process Texts\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The end-task, tracking the location and existence of entities through the text, is challenging because the causal effects of actions are often implicit and need to be inferred. We find that previous models that have worked well on synthetic data achieve only mediocre performance on ProPara, and introduce two new neural models that exploit alternative mechanisms for state prediction, in particular using LSTM input encoding and span prediction. The new models improve accuracy by up to 19%.

From persistent keys for access to digital objects in network environments, the concept of persistent identifiers has been more recently extended to identify also physical objects like people, institutions and any type of relevant entity in the e-Science domain, opening the way to the creation of an integrated information space where a network of resources can be resolved, linked, navigated and analyzed, as the Linked Open Data approach envisions for the Web. However, the creation and full exploitation of this valuable network of connections is currently hindered by the fragmentation and lack of coordination of the digital identifier ecosystem. The aim of this paper is to propose an open, distributed and scalable infrastructure for interoperating existing Persistent Identifiers and other digital identifier systems (like Cool URIs) in e-science, overcoming geographical, disciplinary and organizational boundaries. The Digital Identifier interoperability infrastructure is presented as a cross-cutting solution of core services enabling interoperability at three different levels: identifier, co-reference and semantic.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111398", "output": "Existence Theorems for Generalized Vector Quasi-Equilibrium Problems: A Fan-KKM Approach to Efficient and Weakly Efficient Solutions", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Results: Fluorescently labeled human T cells, natural killer cells (NK), and various target cells (NALM6, K562, EL4) were co-incubated on polydimethylsiloxane arrays of sub-nanoliter wells (nanowells), and imaged using multi-channel time-lapse microscopy. The proposed cell segmentation and tracking algorithms account for cell variability and exploit the nanowell confinement property to increase the yield of correctly analyzed nanowells from 45% (existing algorithms) to 98% for wells containing one effector and a single target, enabling automated quantification of cell locations, morphologies, movements, interactions, and deaths without the need for manual proofreading.

In this paper, we scrutinize the effectiveness of different labeled sample selection approaches for training set creation, to be used in semisupervised learning approaches for complex visual pattern recognition problems.

These approaches are explored in the context of four semisupervised learning techniques, i.e., graph-based approaches (harmonic functions and anchor graph), low-density separation, and smoothness-based multiple regressors, and evaluated in two real-world challenging computer vision applications: image-based concrete defect recognition on tunnel surfaces and video-based activity recognition for industrial workflow monitoring.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111401", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.

This paper presents a scalable intra coding optimization (SICO) scheme for the third generation of audio video coding standard (AVS3). The complexity distribution and inheriting relationship among different partitioning, as well as intra prediction modes, are systematically analyzed. Subsequently, low-complexity algorithms are proposed, which could early exclude unlikely coding modes safely. In particular, a data-driven binary classifier is elegantly trained for the determination of coding unit partitioning. Moreover, the preliminary coding information can be exhaustively utilized for the mode decision in a low-cost manner. The proposed method provides scalable intra coding optimizing solutions, which is eligible to cater to various application scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed method could achieve a wide range of encoding complexity reduction from 18% to 76% with moderate compression performance loss. One implementation of the proposed method has been adopted to the AVS3 reference software.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111402", "output": "\"Unifying the Fog: A Framework for Adaptive Online Learning and Management in IoT Environments\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The unique features of IoT include extreme heterogeneity, massive number of devices, and unpredictable dynamics partially due to human interaction. These call for foundational innovations in network design and management. Ideally, it should allow efficient adaptation to changing environments, and low-cost implementation scalable to a massive number of devices, subject to stringent latency constraints. To this end, the overarching goal of this paper is to outline a unified framework for online learning and management policies in IoT through joint advances in communication, networking, learning, and optimization. From the network architecture vantage point, the unified framework leverages a promising fog architecture that enables smart devices to have proximity access to cloud functionalities at the network edge, along the cloud-to-things continuum. From the algorithmic perspective, key innovations target online approaches adaptive to different degrees of nonstationarity in IoT dynamics, and their scalable model-free implementation under limited feedback that motivates blind or bandit approaches. The proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that leads to systematic designs and analysis of task-specific learning and management schemes for IoT, along with a host of new research directions to build on.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111403", "output": "\"Distributed Data Allocation via Market-Based Control: A Cloud Database Perspective\"\n\nor\n\n\"Market-Based Approach for Efficient Query Load Distribution in Cloud Databases\"\n\nor\n\n\"Balancing Data Distribution and Response Time in Cloud-Enabled Database Systems\"\n\nor\n\n\"Intelligent Data Allocation in Cloud Databases using Market-Based Mechanisms\"\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In these networks, proper utilization of network resources is desirable to maintain Quality of Service (QoS). In multi-hop end-to-end communication, intermediate nodes may eavesdrop on data in transit. As a result, a secured and reliable data delivery from source to destination is required. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, known as QASEC, to achieve better throughput by securing end-to-end communication in MANETs. The QoS is maintained through an optimal link selection from a queue of available transmission links. The end-to-end communication is secured by authentication. A simple secret-key based symmetric encryption is deployed for interacting nodes. Our proposed QASEC scheme prevents the malicious nodes from data exchange with legitimate intermediate nodes on any established path between the source and the destination. Experimental results show that QASEC performs better in terms of packet-loss rate, jitter and end-to-end delay. Furthermore, QASEC is efficient against various attacks and has a much better performance in terms of associated costs, such as key generation, encryption, and storage and communication.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.12}, {"id": "1111405", "output": "Based on the provided features, I've generated a title for the abstract:\n\n\"Neural-Inspired Model Predictive Control with Emotion-Modulated Planning Horizon for Efficient Decision-Making\"\n\nor \n\n\"Emotion-Guided Transition from Model-Based to Model-Free Control via Adaptive Planning Horizon\"\n\nor \n\n\"Bi", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Specifically, the output policy is obtained by solving a model predictive control problem with a locally optimal state value as terminal constraints. When the planning horizon decreases to zero, the MB control will transform into the MF control smoothly. Meanwhile, inspired by the neural mechanism of emotion modulation on decision-making, we build a biologically plausible computational model of emotion processing. This model can generate an uncertainty-related emotional response on the basis of the state prediction error and reward prediction error, and then dynamically modulates the planning horizon in the tasks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decision-making framework can produce better policies than traditional methods. Emotion modulation can shift the MB and MF control well to improve the learning efficiency and the speed of decision-making.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111406", "output": "\"Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets for Effective Multi-Slot Information Extraction: A Novel Approach to Removing Incorrect Extractions in Ambiguous Languages\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Most researches on this task are concerned with applying IE patterns (rules) to extract related entities from unstructured documents. An important obstacle for the success in this task is unknowingness where text portions containing interested information are. This problem is more complicated when involving languages with sentence boundary ambiguity, e.g. the Thai language. Applying IE rules to all reasonable text portions can degrade the effect of the obstacle, but it raises another problem that is incorrect (unwanted) extractions. This paper aims to present a method for removing incorrect extractions. In the method, extractions are represented as intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), and a similarity measure for IFSs is used to calculate distance between IFS of an unclassified extraction and that of each already-classified extraction. The concept of k nearest neighbor is adopted to design whether the unclassified extraction is correct of not. From the preliminary experiment on a medical domain, the proposed technique improves extraction precision while satisfactorily preserving recall.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "1111407", "output": "Secure and Reliable On-Off Control of Peripherals in Smart Devices: A TrustZone-Based Solution", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Journalists want to reliably turn off radios to protect their sources during investigative reporting. Users wish to ensure cameras and microphones are reliably off during private meetings. In this paper, we present SeCloak, an ARM TrustZone-based solution that ensures reliable on-off control of peripherals even when the platform software is compromised. We design a secure kernel that co-exists with software running on mobile devices (e.g., Android and Linux) without requiring any code modifications. An Android prototype demonstrates that mobile peripherals like radios, cameras, and microphones can be controlled reliably with a very small trusted computing base and with minimal performance overhead.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.39}, {"id": "1111408", "output": "\"Shadowing the Guest: Dark Shadows for User-Level Virtualization\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A shadow process on the host mirrors a process in the guest at the level of the virtual and physical address space, terminating in the host physical addresses. Previous shadow process mechanisms have required changes to the guest and host kernels. We describe a shadow process technique that is implemented at user-level in both the guest and the host. In our technique, we refer to the host shadow process as a dark shadow as it arranges its own elements to avoid conflicting with the guest process's elements. We demonstrate the utility of dark shadows by using our implementation to create system call forwarding and device file-level device virtualization prototypes that are compact and simple.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.31}, {"id": "1111409", "output": "\"Analytic Process Maturity Model: A Framework for Organizational Growth and Success\"\n\nor\n\n\"Maturation of Analytics Capabilities: A Five-Stage Framework for Organizational Development\"\n\nor\n\n\"From Capabilities to Analytics: A Process Maturity Model for Organizations\"\n\nor\n\n\"Building a Mature Analytics Function: A", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

While multiprocessor systems offer extra computing power, it also opens a new range of opportunities to improve fault-robustness. This paper focuses on a problem of achieving fault-tolerance using replications in real-time, multiprocessor systems. In the problem, multiple replicas, or copies, of a computing task are executed on distinct processors to resist potential processor failures and computing faults. Two greedy, approximation heuristics, named Worst Fit Increasing K-Replication and First Fit Increasing K-Replication, are studied to maximise the number of real-time tasks assigned on a system with identical processors, respecting to the tasks' replicating and timely requirements. Worst case performance is analysed by using an approximation ratio between the algorithms and an optimal solution. We mathematically prove that the ratios of using both algorithms are infinitely close to 2. Simulations are performed on a large set of testing cases which can be used to bring to light the average performance of using the algorithms in practice. The results show that both heuristic algorithms provide simple but fast and effective solutions to solve the problem.[GRAPHICS]Assigning real-time tasks to a multiprocessor system with replications.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111411", "output": "Based on the provided similar abstract-title pairs and features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n[1] \"Evaluating the Alignment of Miners' Incentives with Smart Contract Execution Time on Ethereum\"\n[2] \"Miner Incentives and Smart Contract Performance: A Comparative", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The successful operation of the Ethereum blockchain depends on whether the miners' incentives (in the form of fees) to execute contracts is proportional to the miners' cost (in terms of energy usage, and thus CPU usage). In general, if the received fee is not proportional to the computational cost, miners would prefer some tasks over others, thus potentially adversely affecting the continuing dependable operation of the blockchain. In this paper we design a benchmark to compare smart contract execution time with the award a miner would receive, to determine if incentives align. We present the design of the benchmarking approach and provide initial results for the Python Ethereum client running on a Mac. The results indicate that for functions in Ethereum's most popular contracts the difference of reward per CPU second can be up to a factor of almost 50. In addition, contract creation, which is done once for each new contract, can be up to 6 times more lucrative than the regular execution of contract functions. Potentially, these discrepancies result in misaligned incentives that impact the dependable operation of the blockchain.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111412", "output": "Big Data Security: A Systematic Mapping Study of the Main Issues and Proposed Solutions\n\nor\n\nBig Data Security: A Comprehensive Review of the Main Problems and Solutions\n\nor\n\nBig Data Security Challenges and Solutions: A Systematic Mapping Study\n\nor\n\nBig Data Security: Mapping the Main Issues and Proposed Solutions in the Big", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The continuous growth in the importance and volume of data has created a new problem: it cannot be handled by traditional analysis techniques. This problem was, therefore, solved through the creation of a new paradigm: Big Data. However, Big Data originated new issues related not only to the volume or the variety of the data, but also to data security and privacy. In order to obtain a full perspective of the problem, we decided to carry out an investigation with the objective of highlighting the main issues regarding Big Data security, and also the solutions proposed by the scientific community to solve them. In this paper, we explain the results obtained after applying a systematic mapping study to security in the Big Data ecosystem. It is almost impossible to carry out detailed research into the entire topic of security, and the outcome of this research is, therefore, a big picture of the main problems related to security in a Big Data system, along with the principal solutions to them proposed by the research community.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111413", "output": "Evaluating the Efficiency of CLOCK-Pro Using Switching Hash-tables (CUSH) for Network Caching: A Comparative Study with Traditional Policies", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The novel aspects of ICN (e.g., the combination of caching, multicasting, and aggregating requests) is based on names that act as addresses for content. The communication with name has the potential to cope with the growing and complicating Internet technology, for example, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and a smart society. To realize ICN, router hardware must implement an innovative cache replacement algorithm that offers performance far superior to a simple policy-based algorithm while still operating with feasible computational and memory overhead. However, most previous studies on cache replacement policies in ICN have proposed policies that are too blunt to achieve significant performance improvement, such as first-in first-out (popularly, FIFO) and random policies, or impractical policies in a resource-restricted environment, such as least recently used (LRU). Thus, we propose CLOCK-Pro Using Switching Hash-tables (CUSH) as the suitable policy for network caching. CUSH can identify and keep popular content worth caching in a network environment. CUSH also employs CLOCK and hash-tables, which are low-overhead data structure, to satisfy the cost requirement. We numerically evaluate our proposed approach, showing that our proposal can achieve cache hits against the traffic traces that simple conventional algorithms hardly cause any hits.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.58}, {"id": "1111414", "output": "\"Embodied Cognition in Human-Robot Collaboration: Grounding Episodic Knowledge through Natural Language Interaction\"\n\nor\n\n\"Semantic and Episodic Memory in Human-Robot Assemblage: A Bi-Directional Learning Framework\"\n\nor\n\n\"Ontological and Episodic Knowledge Integration through Human-Robot Interaction:", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Generally speaking, this formulation is apparently based on an oversimplified assumption that the response is solely dependent on the input utterance. It ignores the subjective factor of the responder, e.g., his/her emotion or knowledge state, which is a major factor that affects the response in practice. Without explicitly differentiating such subjective factor behind the response, existing generation models can only learn the general shape of conversations, leading to the blandness problem of the response. Moreover, there is no intervention mechanism within the existing generation process, since the response is fully decided by the input utterance. In this work, we propose to view the conversation task as a dual-factor generation problem, including an objective factor denoting the input utterance and a subjective factor denoting the responder state. We extend the existing neural sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model to accommodate the responder state modeling. We introduce two types of responder state, i.e., discrete and continuous state, to model emotion state and topic preference state, respectively. We show that with our dual-factor generation model, we can not only better fit the conversation data, but also actively control the generation of the response with respect to sentiment or topic specificity.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "1111418", "output": "\"Fault Tolerant Distributed Storage Systems: A Critical Analysis of Redundancy and Resilience in the Face of File-System Failures\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We characterize eight popular distributed storage systems and uncover numerous problems related to file-system fault tolerance. We find that modern distributed systems do not consistently use redundancy to recover from file-system faults: a single file-system fault can cause catastrophic outcomes such as data loss, corruption, and unavailability. We also find that the above outcomes arise due to fundamental problems in file-system fault handling that are common across many systems. Our results have implications for the design of next-generation fault-tolerant distributed and cloud storage systems.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "1111419", "output": "\"Automated Text-Mining of Gene and MicroRNA Expression from Literature in the Context of Disease: A Novel Approach for Enhancing Clinical Research and Diagnostics\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Characterizing expression profiles is useful for clinical research, and diagnostics and prognostics of diseases. There are currently several high-quality databases that capture gene expression information, obtained mostly from large-scale studies, such as microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies, in the context of disease. The scientific literature is another rich source of information on gene expression-disease relationships that not only have been captured from large-scale studies but have also been observed in thousands of small-scale studies. Expression information obtained from literature through manual curation can extend expression databases. While many of the existing databases include information from literature, they are limited by the time-consuming nature of manual curation and have difficulty keeping up with the explosion of publications in the biomedical field. In this work, we describe an automated text-mining tool, Disease-Expression Relation Extraction from Text (DEXTER) to extract information from literature on gene and microRNA expression in the context of disease. One of the motivations in developing DEXTER was to extend the BioXpress database, a cancer-focused gene expression database that includes data derived from large-scale experiments andmanual curation of publications. The literature-based portion of BioXpress lags behind significantly compared to expression information obtained from large-scale studies and can benefit from our textmined results. We have conducted two different evaluations to measure the accuracy of our text-mining tool and achieved average F-scores of 88.51 and 81.81% for the two evaluations, respectively. Also, to demonstrate the ability to extract rich expression information in different disease-related scenarios, we used DEXTER to extract information on differential expression information for 2024 genes in lung cancer, 115 glycosyltransferases in 62 cancers and 826 microRNA in 171 cancers. All extractions using DEXTER are integrated in the literature-based portion of BioXpress.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.66}, {"id": "1111420", "output": "Based on the provided features, I generate the following title:\n\n\"Parallel Simulation Framework for Optimizing Virtual Content Distribution Networks in Cloud-Enabled Communication Networks\"\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\"Efficient Simulation of vCDNs: A Parallel Framework for Evaluating Network Performance and Resource Optimization\"\n\nThese titles are inspired by similar abstract-title pairs from my", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

As cache placement is based on both the content type and geographic location of a user request, it has a significant impact on service delivery and network congestion. To study the effectiveness of cache placements and hierarchical network architectures composed of sites, a novel parallel simulation framework is proposed utilizing a discrete-time approach. Unlike other simulation approaches, the proposed simulation framework can update, in parallel, the state of sites and their resource utilization with respect to incoming requests in a significantly faster manner at hyperscale. It allows for simulations with multiple types of content, different virtual machine distributions, probabilistic caching, and forwarding of requests. In addition, power consumption models allow the estimation of energy consumption of the physical resources that host virtual machines. The results of simulations conducted to assess the performance and applicability of the proposed simulation framework are presented. Results are promising for the potential of this simulation framework in the study of vCDNs and optimization of network infrastructure.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111421", "output": "Optimizing UAV Trajectories for Efficient Communication Relay in Bandwidth-Hungry and Delay-Tolerant Applications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

They can act as high-altitude flying relays to support communications between ground nodes due to their ability to provide line-of-sight links. With the flourishing Internet of Things, several types of new applications are emerging. In this paper, we focus on bandwidth hungry and delay-tolerant applications where multiple pairs of transceivers require the support of UAVs to complete their transmissions. To do so, the UAVs have the possibility to employ two different bands namely the typical microwave and the high-rate millimeter wave bands. In this paper, we develop a generic framework to assign UAVs to supported transceivers and optimize their trajectories such that a weighted function of the total service time is minimized Taking into account both the communication time needed to relay the message and the flying time of the UAVs, a mixed non-linear programming problem aiming at finding the stops at which the UAVs hover to forward the data to the receivers is formulated. An iterative approach is then developed to solve the problem. First, a mixed linear programming problem is optimally solved to determine the path of each available UAV. Then, a hierarchical iterative search is executed to enhance the UAV stops' locations and reduce the service time. The behavior of the UAVs and the benefits of the proposed framework are showcased for selected scenarios.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.46}, {"id": "1111422", "output": "Optimizing Interactive Search Processes: A Comprehensive Review of Recent Advances and Future Directions in Interactive Information Retrieval", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The FPGA-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators have demonstrated the superior performance and energy efficiency over CPUs and GPUs; in addition, for real-time AI with low batch size, FPGA is expected to achieve further performance improvement over the general purpose computing platform. However, the performance gain of the single-FPGA design is hindered by the limited on-chip resource. In this paper, we leverage a cluster of FPGAs to fully exploit the parallelism in DNNs with the objective of obtaining super-linear performance. To achieve this goal, a novel design, \"XFER\", is proposed to deploy DNNs to FPGA cluster by splitting the DNN layer to multiple FPGAs and moving traffics from memory bus to inter-FPGA links. The resultant system can achieve both workload balance and traffic balance. As a case study, we implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on ZCU102 FPGA boards. Evaluation results demonstrate that XFER on two FPGAs can achieve 3.48x speedup compared with state-of-the-art FPGA designs, achieving super-linear speedup.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.37}, {"id": "1111425", "output": "Based on the provided similar abstract-title pairs, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\nExact k-Coverage Problem with Unbounded Demands: A Study of NP-Hardness and Polynomial-Time Solutions for Special Cases", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Given a set system consisting of a ground set of n points with integer demands $${d_0,dots ,d_{n-1}}$${d0,\u017a,dn-1} and integer rewards, subsets of points, and an integer k, select up to k subsets such that the sum of rewards of the covered points is maximized, where point i is covered if exactly $$d_i$$di subsets containing it are selected. Here we study this problem and some related optimization problems. We prove that the exact k-coverage problem with unbounded demands is NP-hard even for intervals on the real line and unit rewards. Our NP-hardness proof uses instances where some of the natural parameters of the problem are unbounded (each of these parameters is linear in the number of points). We show that this property is essential, as if we restrict (at least) one of these parameters to be a constant, then the problem is polynomial time solvable. Our polynomial time algorithms are given for various generalizations of the problem (in the setting where one of the parameters is a constant).\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.83}, {"id": "1111426", "output": "A Novel Privacy-Enhanced E-Healthcare Monitoring Scheme in Wireless Cellular Networks: Addressing the Gaps in Existing Research", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Major concerns for patient's sensitive information are related to secure data transmission and preserving anonymity. So far, most researchers have only focused on security or privacy issues related to wireless body area network (WBAN) without considering all the communication vulnerabilities. However, since bio data sensed by biosensors travel over both WBAN and the cellular network, it is required to study about a privacy-enhanced scheme that covers all the secure communications. In this paper, we first point out the weaknesses of previous work in [9]. Then, we propose a novel privacy-enhanced E-healthcare monitoring scheme in wireless cellular network. Our proposed scheme provides anonymous communication between a patient and a doctor in a wireless cellular network satisfying security requirements.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111427", "output": "\"Field-Aligned Coarse Quad Layouts on Triangulated Surfaces via Geodesic Tracing and Relaxation-Based LP Formulation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Our method is easy to implement, very robust, and, being directly based on the input cross field, it is able to generate better aligned layouts, even with complicated fields containing many singularities.

Only output the title and nothing else.\nAbstract:\nHeterogeneous MPSoCs typically integrate diverse cores, including application CPUs, GPUs, and HD coders. These cores commonly share an off-chip memory to save cost and energy, but their memory accesses often interfere with each other, leading to undesirable consequences like a slowdown of application performance or a failure to sustain real-time performance. The memory controller plays a central role in meeting the QoS needs of real-time cores while maximizing CPU performance. Previous QoS-aware memory controllers are based on a classic two-tier queuing architecture that buffers memory transactions at the first tier, followed by a second tier that buffers translated DRAM commands. In these designs, QoS-aware policies are used to schedule competing transactions at the first stage, but the translated DRAM commands are served in FIFO order at the second stage. Unfortunately, once the scheduled transactions have been forwarded to the command stage, newly arriving transactions that may be more critical cannot be served ahead of those translated commands that are already queued at the second stage. To address this, we propose a scalable memory controller architecture based on single-tier virtual queuing (STVQ) that maintains a single tier of request queues and employs an efficacious scheduler that considers both QoS requirements and DRAM bank states. In comparison with previous QoS-aware memory controllers, the proposed STVQ memory controller reduces CPU slowdown by up to 13.9% while satisfying all frame rate requirements. We propose further optimizations that can significantly increase row-buffer hits by up to 66.2% and reduce memory latency by up to 19.8%.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.6}, {"id": "1111429", "output": "\"Paraconsistent Quantum Logic via Single-Antecedent/Succedent Sequent Calculus: Duality, Decidability, and Constructive Properties\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

One is the probabilistic gradient-based methods such as conditional random fields (CRF) and neural networks (e.g., RNN), which have high accuracy but drawbacks: slow training, and no support of search-based optimization (which is important in many cases). The other is the search-based learning methods such as structured perceptron and margin infused relaxed algorithm (MIRA), which have fast training but also drawbacks: low accuracy, no probabilistic information, and non-convergence in real-world tasks. We propose a novel and \u201ceasy\u201d solution, a search-based probabilistic online learning method, to address most of those issues. The method is \u201ceasy\u201d, because the optimization algorithm at the training stage is as simple as the decoding algorithm at the test stage. This method searches the output candidates, derives probabilities, and conducts efficient online learning. We show that this method with fast training and theoretical guarantee of convergence, which is easy to implement, can support search-based optimization and obtain top accuracy. Experiments on well-known tasks show that our method has better accuracy than CRF and BiLSTM.11The SAPO code is released at https://github.com/lancopku/SAPO.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.56}, {"id": "1111431", "output": "\"Prioritizing Impact: A Decision-Support Tool for Public Sector Data Publishers in Smart Cities\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n<features>\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Accomplishing this task requires deep language understanding which enables inference, connecting each comparison paragraph to different levels of knowledge about world entities and their attributes. So far we have crowdsourced a dataset of more than 14K comparison paragraphs comparing entities from a variety of categories such as fruits and animals.

For benchmarking further progress in the task, we have collected a set of paragraphs as the test set on which human can accomplish the task with an accuracy of 94.2% on open-ended prediction. We have implemented various models for tackling the task, ranging from semantic-driven to neural models. The semantic-driven approach outperforms the neural models, however, the results indicate that the task is very challenging across the models.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111433", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title for the abstract.\n\n<similarpairs>\n\"Optimal Relay Selection for Time-Varying Channels\",\n\"Wireless Relay Networks with Distributed Relay Selection\",\n\"Throughput Optimal Relay Schemes for Wireless Networks\",\n\"Relay Node Selection for Enhanced Wireless Network Performance\",\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this work, we consider a two-hop wireless relay setting, where the channels between the source and relay nodes to the destination node are time varying. The relay nodes are able to overhear the transmissions of the source node which may have a weak connection to the destination, and they help the source node by forwarding its messages to the destination on its behalf, whenever this is needed. We develop a distributed scheme for relay selection and channel access that is suitable for time-varying channels, and prove that this scheme is throughput optimal. We obtain the achievable rate region of our proposed scheme analytically for a relay network with a single source and a single relay node. Meanwhile, for a more general network with more than one relay nodes, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the achievable rate region. In both cases, we demonstrate that the achievable rate region attained with our distributed scheme is the same as the one attained with centralized optimal scheme.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111434", "output": "\"Mitigating Yield Loss through Double-Capture X-Filling for Efficient At-Speed Scan Testing in the DSM Era\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, at-speed scan testing may incur yield loss due to excessive IR-drop caused by high test (shift & capture) switching activity. This paper discusses the mechanism of circuit malfunction due to IR-drop, and summarizes general approaches to reducing switching activity, by which highlights the problem of current solutions, i.e. only reducing switching activity for one capture while the widely used at-speed scan testing based on the launch-off-capture scheme uses two captures. This paper then proposes a novel X-filling method, called double-capture (DC) X-filling, for generating test vectors with low and balanced capture switching activity for two captures. Applicable to dynamic & static compaction in any ATPG system, DC X-filling can reduce IR-drop, and thus yield loss, without any circuit/clock modification, timing/circuit overhead, fault coverage loss, and additional design effort.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "1111435", "output": "\"Efficient Identification of Near-Single-Crossing Preference Profiles in Computational Social Choice\"\n\nor\n\n\"Approximating Single-Crossing in Preference Profiles: Polynomial-Time Algorithms and NP-Completeness Results\"\n\nor\n\n\"Towards Single-Crossing: Efficient Methods for Identifying Near-One-Dimensional Preference Profiles\"\n\nor\n\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A preference profile can be classified as one-dimensional if it has the single-crossing property, which requires that the voters can be ordered from left to right so that their preferences are consistent with this order. In practice, preferences may exhibit some one-dimensional structure, despite not being single-crossing in the formal sense. Hence, we ask whether one can identify preference profiles that are close to being single-crossing. We consider three distance measures, which are based on partitioning voters or candidates or performing a small number of swaps in each vote. We prove that it can be efficiently decided if voters can be split into two single-crossing groups. Also, for every fixed k >= 1 we can decide in polynomial time if a profile can be made single-crossing by performing at most k candidate swaps per vote. In contrast, for each k >= 3 it is NP-complete to decide whether candidates can be partitioned into k sets so that the restriction of the input profile to each set is single-crossing.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111436", "output": "\"Designing Life: The Harmonious Convergence of Algorithms, Geometry, and Medicine\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Although these algorithms have a rich combinatorial, geometric, and mathematical structure, they are almost never covered in computer science classes. Furthermore, many of these algorithms admit provable guarantees of accuracy, soundness, complexity, completeness, optimality, and approximation bounds. The algorithms represent a delicate and beautiful balance between discrete and continuous computation and modeling, analogous to that which is seen in robotics, computational geometry, and other fields in computational science. Finally, computer scientists may be unaware of the almost direct impact of these algorithms for predicting and introducing molecular therapies that have gone in a short time from mathematics to algorithms to software to predictions to preclinical testing to clinical trials. Indeed, the overarching goal of these algorithms is to enable the development of new therapeutics that might be impossible or too expensive to discover using experimental methods. Thus the potential impact of these algorithms on individual, community, and global health has the potential to be quite significant.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "1111437", "output": "Inference of Protein Sequence Preference through Co-Evolutionary Analysis of RNA Binding Proteins: A Cost-Effective Approach", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

LBP is firstly used to remove the effect of illumination and noise, which would enhance the detailed texture characteristics of face images. Then 2DLPP is performed to extract some prominent features and decrease the image dimension with space structure information. The Nearest Neighborhood Classifier (NNC) is used to recognize a face image at the end. In addition, the rule for dimension selection is studied from the results of experiments about choosing an appropriate feature dimension by 2DLPP computation. The experimental results on the Yale, the extended Yale B and CMU PIE C09 benchmark datasets showed that the proposed face feature extraction and recognition method achieves a better performance in comparison with similar techniques, and the proposed dimension selection rule can give an appropriate feature dimension in 2DLPP.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111439", "output": "\"CoDiNMF: Directional Co-Clustering with Multiple Graphs for Improved Clustering Quality and Pattern Discovery\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we propose a new co-clustering method, called CoDiNMF, which improves the clustering quality and finds directional patterns among co-clusters by using multiple directed and undirected graphs. We design the objective function of co-clustering by using min-cut criterion combined with an additional term which controls the sum of net directional flow between different co-clusters. In addition, we show that a variant of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) can solve the proposed objective function effectively. We run experiments on the US patents and BlogCatalog data sets whose ground truth have been known, and show that CoDiNMF improves clustering results compared to other co-clustering methods in terms of average F1 score, Rand index, and adjusted Rand index (ARI). Finally, we compare CoDiNMF and other co-clustering methods on theWikipedia data set of philosophers, and we can find meaningful directional flow of influence among co-clusters of philosophers.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "1111440", "output": "Based on the provided features, I've generated a title that reflects the style and content of the abstract.\n\n\"Learning Utility Regions for Autonomous Goal-Driven Development in Continuous State Spaces\"\n\nor alternatively\n\n\"Separable Utility Regions for Lifelong Learning in Cognitive Developmental Robotics\"\n\nor another possible title \n\n\"Autonomous Utility Model", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Thus, this paper addresses the problem of finding and using goals in continuous state spaces and automatically obtaining sub-goal hierarchies that allow autonomous development. In particular, the main purpose of this paper is to propose a new approach to the creation of utility models based on the concept of separable utility regions (SURs), which reduce the complexity of standard value function like utility models. These regions exhibit a correlation between the expected utility and the response of one sensor of the robot. Once they are discovered, the evaluation of the candidate states is only based on the changes of one sensor, which provides a strong independence from noise or dynamism in the utility models. A non-static variation of the classical collect-a-ball scenario and a robot gathering problem were used to test this approach in simulation and on real robots in order to identify goals and sub-goals in an autonomous way. The results confirm the good response of the method as a highly promising approach towards autonomous learning of continuous domains in cognitive robotics.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111441", "output": "\"Indirect Cloud Monitoring: A Novel Framework for Discovering Accessible Monitoring Paths\"\n\nor\n\n\"Overcoming Access Constraints in Cloud Monitoring: A Study on Indirect Monitoring Path Discovery\"\n\nor\n\n\"Enabling Effective Indirect Cloud Monitoring through Path Discovery: A Preliminary Investigation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Beyond Direct Access: A", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Over the last few years, various Cloud monitoring mechanisms have been proposed with different level of monitoring efficacy. To achieve effective monitoring, the monitoring mechanism is required to address the basic challenge that the information of the target-to-monitor may be inaccessible due to (i) access controls, (ii) privacy protection, or (iii) technical difficulties. Therefore, the indirect monitoring mechanism is particularly proposed for addressing the challenge. Specifically, the indirect mechanism makes inferences about the inaccessible information of monitoring targets with the help of the \"monitoring path\" that contains a special set of accessible monitoring data underpinning the inference task. However, the process to effectively discover the monitoring path is an open issue. To address this problem, we present our preliminary studies in this paper. Firstly, we review existing work and reveal the limitations for discovering monitoring paths. Secondly, we analyze real cases to provide insights for designing monitoring paths. Finally, we propose a framework and planned research tasks for developing a novel monitoring path discovery mechanism that facilitates performing indirect Cloud monitoring as the expected contribution of our research.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111442", "output": "\"Deep Neural Network Testing: Bridging the Gap with Novel Test Criteria and Test Case Generation via Linear Programming\"\n\nor\n\n\"Ensuring Reliability of Deep Neural Networks: A Novel Test Criteria and Test Case Generation Approach Based on Linear Programming\"\n\nor\n\n\"Testing Deep Neural Networks: A Linear Programming Framework for Novel Test Criteria", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, traditional software testing methodology, including test coverage criteria and test case generation algorithms, cannot be applied directly to DNNs. This paper bridges this gap. First, inspired by the traditional MC/DC coverage criterion, we propose a set of four test criteria that are tailored to the distinct features of DNNs. Our novel criteria are incomparable and complement each other. Second, for each criterion, we give an algorithm for generating test cases based on linear programming (LP). The algorithms produce a new test case (i.e., an input to the DNN) by perturbing a given one. They encode the test requirement and a fragment of the DNN by fixing the activation pattern obtained from the given input example, and then minimize the difference between the new and the current inputs. Finally, we validate our method on a set of networks trained on the MNIST dataset. The utility of our method is shown experimentally with four objectives: (1) bug finding; (2) DNN safety statistics; (3) testing efficiency and (4) DNN internal structure analysis.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111443", "output": "Centerpoints in High-Dimensional Spaces: Refining Clarkson's Algorithm with Improved Time Complexity and Applications", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

For a parameter \u03b1 \u2208 (0,1), an \u03b1-centerpoint of P is a point p \u2208 R d such that all closed halfspaces containing P also contain at least \u03b1 n points of P. We revisit an algorithm of Clarkson et al. [1996] that computes (roughly) a 1/(4d2)-centerpoint in \u00d5(d9) randomized time, where \u00d5 hides polylogarithmic terms. We present an improved algorithm that can compute centerpoints with quality arbitrarily close to 1/d2 and runs in randomized time \u00d5(d7). While the improvements are (arguably) mild, it is the first refinement of the algorithm by Clarkson et al. [1996] in over 20 years. The new algorithm is simpler, and the running time bound follows by a simple random walk argument, which we believe to be of independent interest. We also present several new applications of the improved centerpoint algorithm.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.4}, {"id": "1111444", "output": "Range Ambiguity Suppression via Two-Dimensional Phase Coding for Multistatic Radar Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

By transmitting two-dimensional phase coded signals, the two-dimensional spectrum of the range ambiguous signals will be shifted along both range and azimuth directions compared with that of desired signals. Then, part of the two-dimensional spectrum of the range ambiguous signals will be located outside the two-dimensional spectral support, which is known in priori, of the desired signals. Considering the range frequency and Doppler oversamplings, a filter corresponding to the two-dimensional spectral support of the desired signals is applied, which suppresses the range ambiguity. Simulation results of both point targets and distributed targets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.37}, {"id": "1111445", "output": "Quantum Probability Ranking Principle: A Novel Approach for Molecular Compound Ranking in Ligand-Based Virtual Screening", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The tools of virtual screening are widely exploited to enhance the cost effectiveness of lead drug discovery programs by ranking chemical compounds databases in decreasing probability of biological activity based upon probability ranking principle (PRP). In this paper, we developed a novel ranking approach for molecular compounds inspired by quantum mechanics, called quantum probability ranking principle (QPRP). The QPRP ranking criteria would make an attempt to draw an analogy between the physical experiment and molecular structure ranking process for 2D fingerprints in ligand based virtual screening (LBVS). The development of QPRP criteria in LBVS has employed the concepts of quantum at three different levels, firstly at representation level, this model makes an effort to develop a new framework of molecular representation by connecting the molecular compounds with mathematical quantum space. Secondly, estimate the similarity between chemical libraries and references based on quantum-based similarity searching method. Finally, rank the molecules using QPRP approach. Simulated virtual screening experiments with MDL drug data report (MDDR) data sets showed that QPRP outperformed the classical ranking principle (PRP) for molecular chemical compounds.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111446", "output": "\"Secure Visual Secret Sharing Schemes: A Novel Approach to Preventing Fraud in Random Grid-Based VSS\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Only when the participants gather and stack their share pictures the secret image would be reconstructed and recognizable by the human visual system. Two well-known encoding ways of VSS, visual cryptography (VC) and random grid (RG), have been developed in recent years. As both VC and RG have been considered as a secure way for communicating with high security, they have been pointed out with cheating problems. In this paper, we propose two RG-based VSS schemes with fraud prevention for the cases of (2,n) and (k,n). The experimental results and the analysis of security and contrast show that the proposed method is efficient and practical.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.45}, {"id": "1111447", "output": "\"Enabling Efficient Services in the Internet of Everything: A Fog Orchestrator Perspective\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This requires various fault tolerance mechanisms for coping with software and hardware failures. Hierarchical modeling approaches are often used to evaluate the availability of such systems, leveraging the representation of complex failure and repair events in distinct parts of the system. This paper presents an availability evaluation for redundant private clouds, represented by RBDs and Markov chains, hierarchically assembled. These private clouds follow the basic architecture of Eucalyptus-based environments, but employing warm-standby redundant hosts for some of its main components. Closed-form equations for the steady-state availability are presented, allowing direct analytical solution for large systems. The availability equations are symbolically differentiated, allowing parametric sensitivity analysis. The results from sensitivity analysis enables system planning for improving the steady- state availability. The sensitivity indices show that failure of the Eucalyptus Cloud Manager subsystem and the respective repair activities deserve priority for maximizing the system availability.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "1111449", "output": "Based on the provided similar abstract-title pairs, I will generate a title.\n\n\"Developing a Framework for Explicit Management of Architectural Assumptions\"\n\nor\n\n\"A Methodological Approach to Validating and Implementing Architectural Assumption Management\"\n\nor\n\n\"Guidelines for Architectural Assumption Management: A Case Study-Based", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

A pull-request notifies other developers that new changes are proposed, a code review process follows the pull-request that may be merged in the main branch if other developers accept the changes. Many factors influence the acceptance of pull-requests. Since open source software is based on collaboration, it is essential to discover how the affect expressed by developer discussing pull-request issues, namely how they collaborate, influences the acceptance of the pull-request proposed. In this study we analysed the relations with the affect expressed in pull-request issues' comments and whether an issue is merged in the main branch or not. We focused on pull-request issues and we found that issues with higher level anger, sadness, arousal and valence are less likely to be merged while issues with higher level of valence, joy are more likely to be merged. Positive affect indicates a good collaboration environment, and our finding shows that this healthy collaboration is likely to increase the acceptance of pull-requests.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "1111451", "output": "Mobility and Resource Optimization for 6LowPAN: A Proactive EKF-MRPL Protocol for Enhanced Seamless Connectivity and Reduced Signaling Overhead", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

An efficient mobility support protocol provides a continuous seamless connectivity for mobile nodes with constrained resources essentially in terms of energy and link capacity. The existing routing protocol RPL has a very low reactivity to mobility making it inefficient and open to further research improvements. In this paper, we propose a new proactive mobility support protocol named EKF-MRPL based on the Extended Kalman Filter and the RPL standard. The crux of this protocol consists in providing mobile nodes with a seamless connectivity while reducing the number of switching between attachment points to reduce the signaling overhead as well as the power consumption. In the quest to forecast the new point of attachment of a mobile node, we propose to predict its non-linear trajectory based on the Extended Kalman Filter. We set up an analytical model and conducted extensive simulations using the Contiki platform. Simulation results clearly show that our proposed protocol EKF-MRPL outperforms several recent proposals, in particular the EC-MRPL in terms of signaling cost, energy consumption, packet delivery ratio and handover delay.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.61}, {"id": "1111452", "output": "\"Word Match Distance Estimation: A Novel Approach to Alignment-Free Phylogenetic Analysis\"\n\nor \n\n\"Phylogenetic Distance Estimation via Spaced Word Matches: A Comparative Study\"\n\nor \n\n\"Evolutionary Distance Calculation from Spaced Word Matches: A Simple yet Accurate Method for Alignment-Free Phylogenetics", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Most distance functions used by these methods, however, are heuristic measures of dissimilarity, not based on any explicit model of evolution. Herein, we propose a simple estimator of the evolutionary distance between two DNA sequences calculated from the number of (spaced) word matches between them. We show that this distance function estimates the evolutionary distance between DNA sequences more accurately than other distance measures used by alignment-free methods. In addition, we calculate the variance of the number of (spaced) word matches depending on sequence length and mismatch probability.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.13}, {"id": "1111453", "output": "\"Efficient Fragile Watermarking with Self-Recovery: A Novel Algorithm for Reduced Computational Cost\"\n\nor \n\"Reducing Computational Overhead in Fragile Watermarking: A New Algorithm for Fast and Accurate Restoration\"\n\nor \n\"Enhancing Self-Recovery Capabilities in Fragile Watermarking: A", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This is achieved by generating two sequences of reference bits associated to the 5 most significant bit-planes (MSBPs) of the image. The reference bits and some authentication bits are then allocated to the 3 least significant bit-planes (LSBPs) of the image. The receiver uses the authentication bits to localise altered pixel-blocks and then executes an iterative restoration mechanism to calculate the original value of the watermarked pixels. Experimental results demonstrate that the embedding method executes significantly faster compared to the state-of-the-art method while achieving a high restoration performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.13}, {"id": "1111454", "output": "\"Modeling Spatial and Temporal Variability in Ride-Sharing Requests: A Graph-Based Approach to Synthetic Data Generation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

We introduce a graph model that captures the spatial and temporal variability of ride requests and the potentials for ride pooling. We discover these ride request graphs exhibit a well known property called densification power law often found in real graphs modelling human behaviors. We show the pattern of ride requests and the potential of ride pooling for a city can be characterized by the densification factor of the ride request graphs. Previous works have shown that it is possible to automatically generate synthetic versions of these graphs that exhibit a given densification factor. We present an algorithm for automatic generation of synthetic ride request graphs that match quite well the densification factor of ride request graphs from actual ride request data.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.48}, {"id": "1111455", "output": "Real-Time Catadioptric Stereo Tracking Using Ultrafast Mirror-Drive Pan-Tilt Active Vision Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

By accelerating video-shooting, computation, and actuation at the millisecond-granularity level for time-division multithreaded processing in ultrafast gaze control, the active vision system can function virtually as two or more tracking cameras with different views. It enables a single active vision system to act as virtual left and right pan-tilt cameras that can simultaneously shoot a pair of stereo images for the same object to be observed at arbitrary viewpoints by switching the direction of the mirrors of the active vision system frame by frame. We developed a monocular galvano-mirror-based stereo tracking system that can switch between 500 different views in a second, and it functions as a catadioptric active stereo with left and right pan-tilt tracking cameras that can virtually capture 8-bit color 512 x 512 images each operating at 250 fps to mechanically track a fast-moving object with a sufficient parallax for accurate 3D measurement. Several tracking experiments for moving objects in 3D space are described to demonstrate the performance of our monocular stereo tracking system.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.44}, {"id": "1111456", "output": "\"Rotational Invariance in Spatial Pyramid Representation for Image Classification\"\n\nor\n\n\"A Novel Spatial Pyramid Approach Robust to Rotational Variations in Image Classification\"\n\nor\n\n\"Rotational Insensitivity in Image Classification via Spatial Pyramid Histograms of Visual Words\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To facilitate regression analysis with SPIN predictors, we extend bag-of-words representations to more complex settings, in which each primitive variable being represented is essentially unique, so that it becomes necessary to group the variables in order to simplify the representation and enhance interpretability and statistical power. We propose an empirical Bayes approach called spinlets, which first constructs a partitioning tree to guide the reduction with mixed spatial granularities, and then refines the representation of predictors according to the relevance to the response. We consider an inverse Poisson regression model, regularized by a multiscale extension of the generalized double Pareto prior, induced via a novel tree-structured parameter expansion scheme. Our approach is motivated by an application in soccer analytics, in which we obtain spinlets visualizations of soccer passing networks under the supervision of team performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111462", "output": "\"Assessing Air Quality and Urban Landscaping: A Multi-Faceted Approach to Distinguishing Urban and Non-Urban Environments\"\n\n<similarpairs>\n[\"Assessing Air Quality and Urban Landscaping\", \"Evaluating Air Quality and Urban Features\"], \n[\"Distinguishing Urban and", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Instead of swapping a face on to an existing picture, our model directly generates realistic context and background pixels based on the features of the provided face mask. Unlike facial inpainting algorithms, it can generate realistic hallucinations even for a large number of missing pixels. Our model is composed of a cascaded network of GAN blocks, each tasked with hallucination of missing pixels at a particular resolution while guiding the synthesis process of the next GAN block. The hallucinated full face image is made photo-realistic by using a combination of reconstruction, perceptual, adversarial and identity preserving losses at each block of the network. With a set of extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in hallucinating context and background pixels from face masks varying in facial pose, expression and lighting, collected from multiple datasets subject disjoint with our training data. We also compare our method with popular face inpainting and face swapping models in terms of visual quality, realism and identity preservation. Additionally, we analyze our cascaded pipeline and compare it with the progressive growing of GANs, and explore its usage as a data augmentation module for training CNNs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.41}, {"id": "1111465", "output": "\"Value Modeling for Coordination Processes: A Framework for Quantifying Profitability and Fraud Risk\"\n\nor\n\n\"Deriving Value Models for Coordination Processes: A Guide to Identifying Fraud Opportunities and Quantifying Financial Impact\"\n\nor\n\n\"Coordination Process Value Modeling: A Novel Approach to Profitability and Risk Assessment\"\n\nor", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Coordination processes are meant to be profitable for the business actors that execute them. However, because business actors are independent, there is also an increased risk of fraud. To compute profitability as well as quantify the risk of fraud, we need to attach value models to coordination process models. In this paper, we propose guidelines for deriving a value model from any coordination process model. Next, we show how our approach can be used to identify possibilities of fraud offered by a coordination process, as well as quantify the financial impact of known fraudulent processes. Finally, we discuss additional applications, such as identifying commercially superfluous tasks, or missing tasks needed to achieve a financially sustainable process.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111466", "output": "A Novel Approach to Quadratic Minimum Spanning Tree Problems: Unveiling Structure and Special Cases Through Polynomial Solvability and Recursive Formulas", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, the column-oriented DBMS is difficult to use for processing big-data analysis updated in real time, because the column-oriented storage performs inefficient OLTP when processing row-oriented updates. Therefore, we attempted to enable the column-oriented DBMS to efficiently process OLTP for performing big data analysis. In this paper, we propose a DBMS architecture by focusing on storage class memory (SCM) such as STT-MRAM, PRAM, and ReRAM of new storage devices used in future computing. Our approach assumed that SCMs have not yet been considered, we propose a TiD-based update index for modifying the column data using SCMs in real time. Moreover, the DBMS mechanism we consider is able to identify a row of the column data such that we efficiently use a materialization method for aggregation in OLAP in which users perform a similar OLAP query for data analysis.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.47}, {"id": "1111469", "output": "\"Semi-Online Hierarchical Scheduling on Two Machines: Competitive Ratios for Minimizing Load lp-Norm\"\n\nor\n\n\"Two Semi-Online Hierarchical Scheduling Problems on Identical Machines: Load lp-Norm Minimization with Competitive Ratios\"\n\nor\n\n\"Semi-Online Hierarchical Scheduling on Two", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Consequently, the buildings' temporal density predictions and their nodes spatial distribution modeling have to follow real-world scenarios to provide a realistic evaluation. However, there is lack of real-world building-level density studies that examine these aspects thoroughly. As a result, this work is a data-driven study that investigates the temporal density predictability and spatial density distributions of more than 100 real buildings with ten different categories, over 150 days across three semesters. The study covers the buildings nodes' temporal modeling and predictions, and their spatial distributions in the building. Seasonal predictive models are utilized to predict hour-by-hour density for a variable length of consequent periods using training data with different lengths. The models include Seasonal Naive, Holt-Winters' seasonal additive, TBATS, and ARIMA-seasonal. The results show that the Seasonal Naive model is often selected as the best predictive model when training phase covers a shorter period. For example, Seasonal Naive predicted with the least error in 73%, 63% and 57% of cases in summer, spring, and fall respectively when using only one week to predict its consecutive five weeks with mean normalized error 25% on average. However, when using five weeks of data to predict the sixth week, the TBATS model predicted with the least error in 60%, 54% and 43% of cases in fall, spring and summer respectively with mean absolute error 19% on average. When investigating the spatial density distributions, power law, log-logistic and lognormal distributions are usually selected as the first best-fit distributions for 82%, 65%, 62% of buildings in the summer, spring and fall respectively.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "1111471", "output": "\"Tightening the Fabric: Probabilistic Wormhole NoCs for Real-Time Applications\"\n\nor\n\n\"Wormhole Interconnects for the Uncertain Future: PTA-Enabled NoC Designs\"\n\nor\n\n\"Probabilistic Timing Analysis for Wormhole-Based NoCs: A Path to Guaranteed Performance\"\n\nor\n\n\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, wNoCs suitability in the context of critical real-time applications has not been demonstrated yet.\n\nIn this article, in the context of probabilistic timing analysis (PTA), we propose a PTA-compatible wNoC design that provides tight time-composable contention bounds. The proposed wNoC design builds on PTA ability to reason in probabilistic terms about hardware events impacting execution time (e.g., wNoC contention), discarding those sequences of events occurring with a negligible low probability. This allows our wNoC design to deliver improved guaranteed performance w.r.t. conventional time-deterministic setups. Our results show that performance guarantees of applications running on top of probabilistic wNoC designs improve by 40% and 93% on average for 4 \u00d7 4 and 6 \u00d7 6 wNoC setups, respectively.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111472", "output": "Control Design for Discrete Event Systems using Petri Nets: A Search-Based Approach to Optimize Reachability and Firing Sequence\n\nor \n\nOptimizing Reachability and Firing Sequence in Discrete Event Systems: A Petri Net Control Design Framework\n\nor \n\nPetri Net-Based Control Design for Discrete Event Systems", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Obtaining early and accurate test power estimates has so far been a bottleneck since design-for-test (DFT) modifications such as scan manifest only in the gate-level circuit representation. In this work, we describe a methodology that enables us to perform early and efficient power estimation for scan-based circuits at RTL. We explain the method, its realization using features of a commercial power estimation engine and its evaluation on various production 65nm and 45nm industrial designs.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111474", "output": "\"Optimizing Approximate Array Multipliers for Power-Area Trade-Offs in Digital Circuit Design\"\n\nor \n\n\"Design and Analysis of Approximate Array Multipliers for Energy-Efficient Digital Systems\"\n\nor \n\n\"A Systematic Approach to Designing Approximate Array Multipliers for Variable Application Requirements\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These devices provide users with more and more functions that make them real sensing platforms. Exploiting the capabilities offered by smartphones, users can collect data from the surrounding environment and share them with other entities in the network thanks to existing communication infrastructures, i.e., 3G/4G/5G or WiFi. In this work, we present a system based on participatory sensing paradigm using smartphones to collect and share local data in order to monitor make a campus \"smart\". In particular, our system infers the activities performed by users (e.g., students) in a campus in order to identify trends and behavioral patterns. This information allows the system to decide in real-time which actions are needed to provide the best possible services to users, according to their needs and preferences.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111476", "output": "\"Probabilistic Modeling and Dynamic Windowing for Handling Reduced Reliability in Complex Event Processing Systems\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The big data era brought with it an increase in the scale and frequency of event reporting. Internet of Things adds another layer of complexity with multiple, continuously changing event sources, not all of which are perfectly reliable, often suffering from late arrivals. In this work we propose a probabilistic model to deal with the problem of reduced reliability of event arrival time. We use statistical theories to fit the distributions of inter-generation at the source and network delays per event type. Equipped with these distributions we propose a predictive method for determining whether an event belonging to a window has yet to arrive. Given some user-defined tolerance levels (on quality and timeliness), we propose an algorithm for dynamically determining the amount of time a complex event time-window should remain open. Using a thorough empirical analysis, we compare the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-art mechanisms for delayed arrival of events and show the superiority of our proposed method.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.43}, {"id": "1111477", "output": "Multilingual Event Instance Identification via Gated MultiLingual Attention Framework\n\n<similarpairs>\n\n<features>\n\n<otherwriters>", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, most existing methods for this task focus only on monolingual clues of a specific language and ignore the massive information provided by other languages. Data scarcity and monolingual ambiguity hinder the performance of these monolingual approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel multilingual approach - dubbed as Gated MultiLingual Attention (GMLATT) framework - to address the two issues simultaneously. In specific, to alleviate data scarcity problem, we exploit the consistent information in multilingual data via context attention mechanism. Which takes advantage of the consistent evidence in multilingual data other than learning only from monolingual data. To deal with monolingual ambiguity problem, we propose gated cross-lingual attention to exploit the complement information conveyed by multilingual data, which is helpful for the disambiguation. The cross-lingual attention gate serves as a sentinel modelling the confidence of the clues provided by other languages and controls the information integration of various languages. We have conducted extensive experiments on the ACE 2005 benchmark. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.53}, {"id": "1111478", "output": "Based on the provided features, I will generate a title.

Data communication in social networks can be recorded and analyzed by evaluation. The identification of nodes with the same types of attribute among numerous users has become a research problem in the field of social opportunistic network. Many mobile devices by users have to save and deliver information moment by moment. However, cache space with devices in social network is limited; a large amount of data must be saved and transmitted on time in online social networks. Delay and low delivery ratio may affect communication in opportunistic network. Thus, we propose an algorithm based on user nodes and neighbors in opportunistic networks to improve the transmission environment. Such networks can identify surrounding neighbors to evaluate nodes with probability, which will evaluate neighbors, ensure the high probability of node preferential access to information, and achieve the objectives of cache adjustment. Cache by node can be distributed reasonably. Experiments and a comparison of social opportunistic network algorithms show that the proposed method improves the cache utilization rate of nodes, reduces data transmission delay, and improves the overall network efficiency.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.95}, {"id": "1111479", "output": "Revisiting the Foundations of Cumulative Prospect Theory: A Stochastic Optimization Framework for Estimating and Optimizing CPT-Value Objectives", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The field of observation consists of the entire faculty of the Italian academic system, and so the coauthorship of scientific publications by over 12,000 professors. The broader aim is to improve understanding of the causal nexus between research collaboration and performance. The analysis is thus longitudinal, over two successive five-year periods. Results show a strong increase in the propensity to collaborate at domestic level (both extramural and intramural), however this is less for scientists who remain or become top, than it is for their lower-performing colleagues. In contrast, the increase in international collaboration behavior is greater for scientists who become or remain top than it is for their peers. The increase in productivity by those who acquire top scientist status is due precisely to the greater average impact of the publications achieved in collaboration with foreign colleagues.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111481", "output": "\"Establishing Non-Asymptotic Bounds for the (1+1) Evolution Strategy on the Sphere Function via Drift Analysis\"\n\nor\n\n\"Linear Convergence Analysis of the (1+1) Evolution Strategy with One-Fifth Success Rule on the Continuous Sphere Function\"\n\nor\n\n\"Drift Analysis for Random", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Using this framework we analyze the (1+1) Evolution Strategy with one-fifth success rule on the sphere function. To deal with potential functions that are not lower-bounded, we formulate novel drift theorems. We then use the theorems to prove bounds on the expected hitting time to reach a certain target fitness in finite dimension d. The bounds are akin to linear convergence. We then study the dependency of the different terms on d proving a convergence rate dependency of \u0398(1/d). Our results constitute the first non-asymptotic analysis for the algorithm considered as well as the first explicit application of drift analysis to a randomized search heuristic with continuous domain.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111482", "output": "\"Enriching Ad-Hoc Video Search with Distributed Sense Representations for Enhanced Term Disambiguation and Query Processing\"\n\nor\n\n\"Synergistic Integration of Distributed Sense Representations for Improved Video Search Performance through Sense Disambiguation and Query Filtering\"\n\nor\n\n\"Advancing Ad-Hoc Video Search through Distributed", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Among the several issues associated with this challenging task, this paper particularly focuses on the sense disambiguation/filtering (WSD/WSF) of the terms contained in a search query. We propose WSD/WSF methods which employ distributed sense representations, and discuss their efficacy in improving the performance of an AVS system which makes full use of a large bank of visual concept classifiers. The application of a WSD/WSF method is crucial, as each visual concept classifier is linked with the lexical concept denoted by a word sense. The results are generally promising, outperforming not only a baseline query processing method that only considers the polysemy of a query term but also a strong WSD baseline method.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111483", "output": "\"Enabling Cross-Device Functionality Abstraction for Low-End Edge Devices through Kernel-Level Optimization\"\n\nor\n\n\"Kernel-Level Optimization for Cross-Device Functionality Abstraction on Low-End Edge Devices\"\n\nor\n\n\"Cross-Device Functionality Abstraction via Kernel-Level Optimization for Enhanced Performance on Low-End Edge", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Rather, there has been little exploration of the overall optimization into kernel processing can deliver for increasingly popular but heavy burden on low-end edge devices. Our idea here is to extend the capability of functionality abstraction across edge clients and cloud servers to identify the computation-intensive code regions automatically and execute the instantiation on the server at runtime. This paper is an attempt to explore this vision, ponder on the principle, and take the first steps towards addressing some of the challenges with Open image in new window . As a kernel-level solution, Open image in new window enables edge devices to abstract not only application layer but also system layer functionalities, as if they were to instantiate the abstracted function inside the same Open image in new window kernel programming. Experimental results demonstrate that Open image in new window makes cross-kernel functionality abstraction efficient for low-end edge devices and benefits them significant performance optimization than the default scheme unless in a constraint of low transmission bandwidth.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111484", "output": "\"Triplet Network-Based Writer Retrieval and Identification via L2 Distance and Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Instead of using a network for classification, we propose the use of a triplet network that learns a similarity measure for image patches.

The triplet network is trained by maximizing the interclass distance, while minimizing the intraclass distance in this embedding. The image patches are encoded using the learned feature descriptor. By applying the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors encoding to these features, we generate a feature vector for each document image. A detailed parameter evaluation is given which shows that this method achieves a mean average precision of 86.1% on the ICDAR 2013 writer identification dataset, but future work has to be done to improve the performance on historic datasets.

Although individual vehicles have their own goals to pursue in autonomy, they may also be part of a collective of vehicles, as in the case of a fleet of vehicles of a car sharing company. Accordingly, they may also be required to act in a coordinated way towards the achievement of specific collective goals, or to meet specific city-level objectives. This raises the issue of properly engineering the behavior of such collective of vehicles, by properly capturing their collective requirements also in consideration of their individual goals, and understanding which knowledge about the state of the collective they must be provided with. In this context, this paper shows how the SOTA model can be a very effective tool to support the engineering of self-driving vehicle collectives. SOTA, by bringing together the lessons of goal-oriented requirements engineering, context-aware systems, and dynamical systems modeling, has indeed the potential for acting as a general reference model to help tackle some key issues in the design and development of complex collective systems immersed in dynamic environments, as collectives of self-driving vehicles are.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.16}, {"id": "1111487", "output": "\"Comparative Analysis of Joint-SNV Analysis Methods: A Systematic Evaluation of Statistics-space Boundary Based Test (S-space BBT) in Simulated and Real-World Data Scenarios\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

This major is even more important especially in big data environment that implements knowledge discovery and data mining for producing beneficial information. Beside the inner importance aspect of privacy of personal data, the efficiency of the approaches of preserving privacy is a special factor. This is because of the overheads that injected by privacy preserving methods in decreasing the accuracy of end results of data mining. Soft computing is a general name of a group of logic based methods that have several usages. Its recent usage is in privacy preserving in big data. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of different regular methods of privacy preserving for KDD and Data Mining presented and then reasons of why soft computing methods can be a substitute for Privacy Preserving in these environments are discussed. Beside the analysis and discussion of merit and shortcomings of approaches, a conceptual framework for state of the art of privacy-preserving represented and provides research gaps and future works.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.05}, {"id": "1111489", "output": "\"Dynamic Representation of Feature Weights via Gradient Ascent: A Novel Approach to Neighbor Sparse Reconstruction\"\n\nor \n\n\"A Novel Gradient Ascent Method for Dynamic Representation Frameworks: Enabling Efficient Neighbor Sparse Reconstruction\"\n\nor \n\n\"Dynamic Feature Weight Estimation via Gradient Ascent: A Novel Neighbor Sparse Reconstruction Framework\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

In this paper, we address the questions of what happens after the outbreak of an event in terms of how the event gradually progresses and attains each of its milestones, and how it eventually dissipates. We propose a model based approach to capture the gradual unfolding of an event over time. This enables the model to automatically produce entire timeline trajectories of events from the time of their outbreak to their disappearance. We apply our model on the Twitter messages collected about Ebola during the 2014 outbreak and obtain the progression timelines of several events that occurred during the outbreak. We also compare our model to several existing topic modeling and event detection baselines in literature to demonstrate its efficiency.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.38}, {"id": "1111491", "output": "\"Optimal Sensor Placement for Autonomous Space Robots: A Canonical Chain Approach\"\n\nor\n\n\"Minimizing Sensor Count in Space Robots: A Canonical Chain Optimization Method\"\n\nor\n\n\"Sensor Architecture Optimization for Precise Control in Space Robots using Canonical Chains\"\n\nor\n\n\"Reducing Sensor Complexity in Space Robots: A Novel Canonical", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

These robots will need to be precisely controlled. However, factors such as manipulator joint/actuator friction and spacecraft attitude control thruster inaccuracies can substantially degrade control system performance. Sensor-based control algorithms can be used to mitigate the effects of actuator error, but sensors can add substantially to a space system\u00e2\u8059\u8076s weight, complexity, and cost, and reduce its reliability. Here, a method is presented to determine the sensor architecture that uses the minimum number of sensors that can simultaneously compensate for errors and disturbance in a space robot\u00e2\u8059\u8076s manipulator joint actuators, spacecraft thrusters, and reaction wheels. The placement and minimal number of sensors is determined by analytically structuring the system into \u00e2\u8059\u8079canonical chains\u00e2\u8059\u807a that consist of the manipulator links and spacecraft with force/torque sensors placed between the space robot\u00e2\u8059\u8076s spacecraft and its manipulators. These chains are combined to determine the number of sensors needed for the entire system. Examples of one- and two-manipulator space robots are studied and the results are validated by simulation.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.15}, {"id": "1111492", "output": "\"Optimizing Attention in Real-Time Path Planning for Mobile Robots via Reinforcement Learning and Perceptual Space Estimation\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

The key challenge in concurrently aiming these two goals is how to make an optimal, or near-optimal, decision in spite of time and processing power limitations, which inherently exist in a typical multi-sensor real-world robotic application. To efficiently recognise the environment under these two limitations, attention of an intelligent agent is controlled by employing the reinforcement learning framework. We propose an estimation method using estimated mixture-of-experts task and attention learning in perceptual space. An agent learns how to employ its sensory resources, and when to stop observing, by estimating its perceptual space. In this paper, static estimation of the state space in a learning task problem, which is examined in the WebotsTM simulator, is performed. Simulation results show that a robot learns how to achieve an optimal policy with a controlled cost by estimating the state space instead of continually updating sensory information.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.5}, {"id": "1111493", "output": "\"Formal Verification of Secure Information Flow in Cryptographic Accelerators: A Case Study on AES Implementations\"\n\nor \n\n\"Hardware-Level Information Flow Control for Secure Cryptographic Accelerators: A Formal Verification Approach\"\n\nor \n\n\"Expressing Security Requirements in Cryptographic Accelerators through Information Flow Policies\"\n\nor \n\n\"Secure Information", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

To provide high security assurance, we propose to design and build cryptographic accelerators with hardware-level information flow control so that the security of an implementation can be formally verified. This paper uses an AES accelerator as a case study to demonstrate how to express security requirements of a cryptographic accelerator as information flow policies for security enforcement. Our AES prototype on an FPGA shows that the proposed protection has a marginal impact on area and performance.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.13}, {"id": "1111494", "output": "\"Hierarchical Exemplar-based Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Human Pose Estimation\"\n\nor\n\n\"Exemplar-based Hierarchical Models with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Articulated Object Localization\"\n\nor\n\n\"Deep Hierarchical Exemplar-based Models for Spatially Aware Human Pose Estimation\"\n\nor", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

However, their efficacy on highly articulated objects such as humans is yet to be explored. Inspired by hierarchical object representation and recent application of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) on human pose estimation, we propose a novel formulation that incorporates both hierarchical exemplar-based models and DCNNs in the spatial terms. Specifically, we obtain more expressive spatial models by assuming independence between exemplars at different levels in the hierarchy; we also obtain stronger spatial constraints by inferring the spatial relations between parts at the same level. As our method strikes a good balance between expressiveness and strength of spatial models, it is both effective and generalizable, achieving state-of-the-art results on different benchmarks: Leeds Sports Dataset and CUB-200-2011.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}, {"id": "1111495", "output": "\"Collaborative Writing in the Digital Age: Exploring the Role of GitHub Features in Coordinating Non-Software Digital Artifacts\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Since GitHub offers unique features that are different from traditional ways of collaborative writing, it is interesting to investigate how GitHub features are used for writing. In this paper, we present the preliminary findings of a mixed-methods, case study of collaboration practices in a GitHub book project. We found that the use of GitHub depended on task interdependence and audience participation. GitHub's direct push method was used to coordinate both loosely- and tightly-coupled work, with the latter requiring collaborators to follow socially-accepted conventions. The pull-based method was adopted once the project was released to the public. While face-to-face and online meetings were prominent in the early phases, GitHub's issues became instrumental for communication and project management in later phases. Our findings have implications for the design of collaborative writing tools.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.55}, {"id": "1111496", "output": "Lightweight Deep Learning for Automatic Scenario Recognition in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Systems: A CSI-Based ASR Approach with Knowledge Distillation", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

CSI-based ASR methods, only based on the on-board wireless receivers rather than other expensive sensors, can identify the surrounding environments of vehicles to serve assisted and autonomous driving technologies. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based ASR methods have been proposed, which generally outperform traditional, but they generally have high computation complexity and large model sizes, which are hardly introduced into mobile edge devices, such as smart vehicles. In this paper, a lightweight convolutional neural network design method, inspired by MobileNet, is introduced into ASR for reducing computation complexity and model sizes. In addition, this method may bring about performance loss, and knowledge distillation (KD) is adopted to make up for this performance loss. Simulation results demonstrated that our proposed ASR method just has 30% computation complexity and model size of the original method, and its performance loss is very limited, especially after KD.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.51}, {"id": "1111497", "output": "\"Extracting Complex Variability Information from Software Descriptions: A Pattern Structures Approach to Synthesizing Multi-Valued Attribute Variability Models\"", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Nowadays, the increasing complexity of software product lines compels practitioners to design more complex variability models that represent other information than binary features, e.g., multi-valued attributes. Assisting the extraction of complex variability models from variant descriptions is a key task to help the migration towards complex software product lines. In this paper, we address the problem of extracting complex variability information from software descriptions, as a part of the process of complex variability model synthesis. We propose an approach based on Pattern Structures to extract variability information, in the form of logical relationships involving both binary features and multi-valued attributes.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 0.57}, {"id": "1111498", "output": "\"Computing All Reducts with Optimized Algorithm Selection for Information Systems\"\n\nor \n\n\"Fast and Efficient Reduct Computation in Information Systems: A Comparative Analysis\"\n\nor \n\n\"Optimizing Algorithm Selection for Information Systems using Binary Discernibility Matrices\"\n\nor \n\n\"Reduct Computation in Information Systems:", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a scholar that generates titles for abstracts.

Each representation of the image or sentence undergoes an independent neural network, consisting of multiple layers of nonlinear mappings to yield the corresponding embedding. Besides exploiting the image and sentence relationship based on their embeddings, we propose one novel loss to further exploit the relationship within each single modality, namely, image and sentence based on the yielded multiple embeddings, which is used to train the neural networks simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that multiple representations can help to capture the image contents and the sentence semantic meaning more precisely, thus making comprehensive exploitations of the complicated image and sentence matching relationship. More concretely, the proposed matching model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in bidirectional image-sentence retrieval on the Flickr8K, Flickr30K, and Microsoft COCO datasets.\nTitle:"}], "model_inf_time": 1.14}]}
