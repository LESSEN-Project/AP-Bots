It is made with Blue Plate mayo, which I enjoy, and I enjoy Tabasco pepper sauce. But the pepper flavor in this mayo is not a good, and does not have the typical aroma nor flavor of cayenne. The \"heat\" is average. There is a strange after-taste that remains from this mayo. I am a regular user of foods with cayenne added, but there is some other, more prominent, flavor in this mayo that is not appealing.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nCento Petite Diced Tomatoes, 15 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nVery good flavor and aroma! I had never tried this brand before, but now I am very glad I decided to try it. Upon opening a can, the aroma is impressive, and the flavor is too. Very fresh-tasting tomatoes, excellent for addition into sauces, and other dishes. I made a bowl of Salmon salad, and added a few tablespoons of this product into it, and the result was delicious! Everybody who had some, commented on how good the flavor was.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Plate Real Mayonnaise, 30 Ounce Jar\nReview:\nThis is good mayo!

The fish itself is good (in the batch I received), but the label claims \"Net weight: 15 ounces\". The problem is that each can contains only about 9.33 ounces of fish; the rest is water, oil and fish particles suspended in the fluid. The fluid is approximately\n5.67 ounces by weight; 168mL fluid. After 4 hours time allowed for separation, the oil is about 11mL of the total. Hence, each can of \"Chicken of The Sea\" Chub Mackerel is only about 62 percent fish.\nThe measurements were based on the average of 10 cans. Deviation from the average was minimal. The ratio of fish-to-water is the worst of all canned fish I have seen. At 9.33 ounces of fish per can, the actual cost of the fish is approximately $0.268/ounce, far higher than it should be, making it more expensive per ounce than canned Salmon.\nAlso, all 10 cans were excessively dirty, half the cans were badly dented. Rubbing a paper towel around the rim revealed a mix of metal particles and dust/dirt. If you use this product, be sure to clean the can rim before using a can opener, else some of metal and/or dirt can get into the fish.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nMuir Glen Organic Tomato Sauce, No Sugar Added, 15 Ounce Can (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis is excellent tomato sauce! It is my first experience with it, but I know I will use this product again (and again!) in the future. I like that it has no harmful ingredients, and the flavor is superb -- very fresh aroma and flavor! If you do not have the time to do all the work of making your own sauce from your own tomatoes, this product is an excellent substitute.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHellmann's Real Mayonnaise 30 oz\nReview:\nThis product is not bad, and if you require \"no cholesterol\" foods, this is a nice alternative. It is not nearly the  mayonnaise that Duke's is, but it is as good as \"regular\" Hellmann's mayonnaise.\nIt is 40% higher in sodium than \"regular\" mayonnaise, but it is not in a danger range (5% of \"daily value\" per tablespoon).\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nProgresso Bread Crumbs, Italian Style, 2-pack 40 Ounce Canisters\nReview:\nVery nice flavor. I use these breadcrumbs in meatloaf and to bread various foods (baked stuffed mushrooms, fish, others). This product is easy to work with, always consistent in flavor and texture.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHunt's Diced Tomatoes with Green Pepper, Celery &amp; Onion, 14.5 oz, 12 Pack\nReview:\nThe tomatoes appear to be good quality, but the product is too sweet (unless you really like extra-sweet foods). The ingredients list shows that the 3 main ingredients are tomatoes, tomato juice, and sugar. Less than 2% of all other ingredients. The flavor of green peppers, celery and onion is barely perceptible, partly because there is almost none of those vegetables in the can, and partly because there is so much sugar that it over-powers the other flavors. In fact, there is more salt and citric acid than celery or green pepper (see list of ingredients on the label).\nNote that if you use these in a cooked meal, the sweetness is not quite so over-powering, because the bitterness of all the tomato seeds comes out during cooking, and tends to offset the sweetness. Maybe that's why they add so much sugar into this product.\nOn the plus side, none of the cans in my order were dented. Can't say the same about many other canned products I have ordered.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['flavor', 'good', 'product', 'aroma', 'excellent', 'quality', 'great', 'price', 'much', 'many']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\n30 Count - Cafe Escape Variety K Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers - Cafe Caramel, Cafe Vanilla, Cafe Mocha, Chai Latte, Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa, Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa\nReview:\nAll of these flavors are pretty tasty. I especially like the vanilla. But I don't have any interest in drinking these anymore.\nIt's just not the healthiest beverage, and I am in need of focusing on my health currently.\nIf you like these slightly heavier, sweet mocha/latte drinks, go for it.\nI didn't think the hot chocolate was nearly as good as Dunkin Donuts' richer hot chocolate K-cups.\nI also found the flavors to not be as great as I'd hoped. I got sick of them pretty fast. I kinda wish I'd just gotten vanilla. It's pretty sweet, but in a way, it's not as heavy as the others.\n\nAnyway. They aren't good for your body, and they won't help your weight. But if you want a pretty good, sweet, watered down mocha drink, then these will do just fine. They're pretty delicious.\nJust don't blame the company when your weight balloons!!\nRating:\n3.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I just used it to make avocado bread - which turned out like chocolate brownies. Delicious! To me, you don't have to use quite as much of the raw cocoa to get the flavor of the generic cocoa. It's a rich, dark chocolate taste to me. I love it!\n\nThe following isn't a really sweet bread, but it's healthy! 2 mashed avocados, 1/2 cup + 2 T coconut sugar, 2 heaping spoons cocoa, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 cup flour or gluten-free flour mix,  teaspoon baking powder,  teaspoon salt - Preheat oven to 350F. Grease a loaf pan and set aside. Mix dry ingredients. Mix wet ingredients. Then mix together. Bake at 350 degrees in a greased loaf pan for 45 minutes.\n\nThis cocoa gave the mix/bread a dark chocolate taste.\n\nI purchased this cocoa at a promotional price for testing and review purposes. This raw cocoa is organic, which I like, but also you don't have to use as much to get the full chocolate effect. A delicious product, in my opinion!\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

The Hamburger Helper meal sizes are continuing to shrink.  These are a measly 6.6 ounces; about enough for one hungry person or two mildly hungry ones. I add a few extras--about 4 ounces of dry spaghetti noodles, a cup of additional water, some tomatoes and/or other veggies, to make a bigger meal.

I don't know what we would do without this product.  We use it every day, all day, for coffee, tea, sweetening yogurt fruit, etc.  All our family members like it, too.  One bottle lasts for over two months, usually three.  It has no aftertaste, a few drops is all it takes and finally, we've been able to almost eliminate sugars from our diet without \"suffering\".  There are 2,880 drops in a 4 oz or 120ml bottle, according to the manufacturer.  We love it!\nUPDATE:  Received new shipment and bottle label has changed.

Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee. And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too.

It is organic and does have guar gum (which is a food derived, natural ingredient), but it DOES NOT have chemicals/preservatives, which are bad for you.  It is thick and creamy when slightly warmed, has a strong coconut flavor and tastes better than the brands with added preservatives.  (We've tried a lot of them!)  The ingredients are coconut milk, water, guar gum---that's it!  I DO wish it said what percentage of coconut milk was in the can, some brands do, but other than that, we are happy with this brand.  It DOES NOT have an expiration date printed on the can (we wish it did).  The price is more than the brands with preservatives, which I don't understand, I wish it were lower, but if we want food with no preservatives/added chemicals, I guess this is what our option is.  Hopefully, the price will come down.  What we don't like is the shipping--9 out of 24 cans in the case were severely or moderately dented, which means we had to use them soon or immediately (not happy at all about that).  However, we will order this brand again.  UPDATE:  Ordered second case, case was shipped \"as is\", broke open during shipping, all 24 cans arrived severely or moderately dented.  Can't even open most of them with a can opener.  Completely unusable and not safe to use.  Unless packing for shipping changes, even though we love the product, we will not order again. Not happy about that, as we can't find a source to purchase locally.  UPDATE:  Contacted Amazon, they sent another case, better packing, only 2 cans minor dented.  Thank you, Amazon!

I have to say, these are just simply excellent!  These are organic from Frontier Co-op, a company I have ordered products from for decades.  Their quality is usually great, like these vanilla beans.  These beans are plump, slightly juicy, filled with paste, VERY fragrant and aromatic.  The fragrance is just intoxicating.  The flavor is very strong/intense.  One half a pod was all I needed to strongly flavor 1.5 quarts of homemade ice cream! The pods are larger and of a better quality than most and much better than those from the local store.  The price is a bit high.  Next time, I will order a larger quantity to save money.  It does NOT say what grade these beans are or the source of origin/variety.  But, just guessing, they seem to be a grade A.  Whatever they are, these are excellent!

This Lipton's Yellow Label Tea is what most of the rest of the world drinks when they drink Lipton's.  It is not acidic as is the regular USA version we all know (IE: no pucker/dry mouth).  It is bold, but mellow--sometimes with a hint of smoky flavor.  We first drank this while living overseas, I love this Yellow Label tea.  It is very good made as hot tea as well as iced.

It has a smooth, not harsh, yet bold flavor.  It stands up well to milk or cream and makes a very good iced tea.  After drinking this, Lipton's tea just seems so unbearably harsh and acrid. It brews up well, never seeming to become bitter.  It works well as a general, all purpose, every day tea; also, blending well with mint or other flavors, like cinnamon, if that's what you like.  PG is good black, too.  It is a finely cut tea, BUT, so what?  It steeps well and tastes great.  I use Finum tea filters, available on Amazon, to brew, which catches all the pieces.  I searched high and low, for years, and paid way too much for stale PG Tips before finding it on Amazon at a very good price, especially when purchased at subscribe and save prices.  I prefer the loose tea, but occasionally use tea bags, for traveling.

Great price and beautiful as stated. There are 8 stems but about 23 buds, some slightly open (all opened eventually), to see and smell what was coming; many buds to open still (and they all did, even one with a bent stem. These are big, beautiful, and very fragrant). I tried to cancel this order as I ordered them on Wednesday and it stated 1 day delivery and our anniversary was Friday (my bad), but at checkout it stated they would be delivered on Monday. The page stated, 'no deliveries on Sat., Sun., or Mon.', so, they would be at least 4 days late and likely arrive in bad condition. 'My Orders' stated 'preparing for shipment' and so the order could not be canceled. But, the delivery date changed to Friday when I got the shipping notice, and sure enough, they arrived on time, and in very great shape. All of the females love them, and, I must admit, they do look and smell great. Better than I or my wife imagined.\nI order again, just because on March 17th (just because) and they arrived in 1 day, perfectly, a couple were open and most in buds. This AM more were open and they look very nice. I highly recommend these, will order again, and I hope this helps someone. Update: The flowers are great but send your own card.\n\nI highly recommend these, they are fragrant, long-lasting, and as beautiful as flowers can be, better than my last local grocery purchase for Mother's Day that lasted about 1 day. I would buy these again,and through Amazon, and I hope this helps someone.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

This time I purchased the 3-pack giving me a chance to write another review!!! Ever since we first tried one of these little salt-shakers, we have become addicted. The mineral content of this salt is outstanding. I love that it really enhances the taste of food instead of just giving it that salty taste you get from processed salt. We use this salt on everything. it is our main go-to salt. That isn't to say that we don't use other salts, as we have quite a collection from all over the world. Some of which cost a small fortune. That being said, this one really stands up well amongst all of them.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nREDMOND Real Sea Salt - Natural Unrefined Organic Gluten Free Fine, 26 ounce pouch (1 Pack)\nReview:\nSalt comes in all different colors and flavors.\nBeing a foodie and salt connoisseur, I have traveled the globe trying every salt I have encountered.\nDo your research and you will see that Real Salt is from a mine in Utah.\nThis is an ancient salt mine. This salt is is unrefined so it contains all of the minerals embedded with it.\nThere is some grit to this salt since it isn't a super fine grind. This is normal and acceptable.\nThis salt has an excellent balance of minerals enhancing all of the foods you eat naturally.\nThis belongs in every household for your main table salt.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nREDMOND Real Sea Salt - Natural Unrefined Organic Gluten Free Fine, 26 ounce pouch (1 Pack)\nReview:\nSalt comes in all different colors and flavors.\nBeing a foodie and salt connoisseur, I have traveled the globe trying every salt I have encountered. I have salt sculptures from all over. Salt comes in many different colors and flavors (i.e. white purple, pink, blue, green, black, brown of many shades). Keep in mind that flavors are different to everyone since every palate is unique and each person has different mineral levels which also changes how it tastes.\nDo your research and you will see that Real Salt is from a mine in Utah.\nThis is an ancient salt mine. Don't worry about the various colors, this salt is is unrefined so it contains minerals embedded with it.\nThere is some grit (minerals) to this salt since it isn't a super fine grind.

It doesn't thicken nearly as well as corn starch. I will happily use it over corn starch until I can find certified organic corn starch.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nPremium Madagascar Vanilla Beans 1/4 lb (26-30 beans) JR Mushrooms Brand\nReview:\nThe smell emanates through the completely sealed package. These beans are soft, moist, fresh and heavenly delicious. I was skeptical when ordering, but WOW, these beans are so fragrant!. These make an excellent paste and are extremely robust. I'll definitely order this again. Mine came through OliveNation.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBell Plantation PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter, 1 lb Jar (2-pack)\nReview:\nHow can you make peanut butter better than it already is? PB2! This is Peanut Butter without all the oil you get in the jar products. The taste is excellent. You can use it just like you do regular peanut butter. It is much lighter than a jar of peanut butter so it transports well. You can add it to grain recipes to give them a nutty flavor. You can use it in chocolates, shakes, etc. We love this and everyone we have told about it loves it too. I love using this on my pad thai dish and other dishes for a peanut flavor without all the added fat. If you LOVE peanut butter, you will LOVE this low fat version.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSpicy World Ground Turmeric Powder, 5 Pound\nReview:\nI am very impressed with the quality of this Turmeric powder. The bag I received was still sealed and the product is very fresh. Upon opening the bag, the intense smell of turmeric filled the room as it should. I tasted this straight and the flavor is robust, earthy, smooth and absent the bitterness you get from roots that aren't fresh. The first dish I made was some basmati rice with this turmeric, some onion, cumin, cayenne and salt. The flavor is exceptional!\n\nI repackaged this for longer storage since this is for day to day cooking. The best way to store this for long-term is to divide it into smaller portions and vacuum seal each portion, then freeze it. Make sure you let it thaw completely to room temperature before opening a packet for use later to avoid moisture issues.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHarvest Snaps Red Lentil Snack Crisps, Onion Thyme, deliciously baked and crunchy veggie snacks with plant protein and fiber, 3-Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nWarning!!! You may want to eat the whole bag in one sitting. Once you start eating these, it is hard to stop. The taste is light, crispy, crunchy herbaciously delicious! Not overly salty, the seasoning is light and keeps you coming back for more. I'm so glad I ordered a 12 pack because they really are that good.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNumi Organic Tea Jasmine Pearls, 16 Ounce Bulk Pouch, Premium Organic Whole Leaf Green Tea, Loose Leaf Flowering Dragon Tea Buds Scented with Real Organic Jasmine (Packaging May Vary)\nReview:\nMMMMMMMMMMMMM! This tea is so delicious! It has lots of flavor. I love it Hot, I love it Cold, I love it in the pot 3 days old! No joke... This tea has a wonderful jasmine flower flavor and smell. I steep it in glass with filtered water. It is highly addictive. You can see the oil floating at the top after steeping. The aroma is so amazing, it fills the room. Every morning should be this good for everyone. I'll definitely buy more. The only nag I have is the ziplock at the top is not affixed properly to the bag, it tore away from the bag after just a couple uses.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRaw Sourwood Honey (Pure Natural Honey) 16oz\nReview:\nThis is a rich-flavored honey. I wasn't sure what to expect by the name since I hadn't researched Sourwood. I enjoy trying honeys from around the globe. This one has to be in my top 5 favorite flavors. It has the essence of maple syrup and goes great with just about anything from beverages to pastries or breads.

Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar, Dark Cherry, 1.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese Eat/Think/Smile baked nutrition bars, are more like a cookie, than a protein bar. Why? Because they have the same nutritional value of a cookie. Each cookie has 200 calories, with 7 grams of FAT, 34 grams of carbs, and 4 grams of Protein. There's a bit of a problem with the saltiness too, with 240mg of Salt. So, if you need a meal replacement, this isn't it. It simply doesnt have enough protein. On the plus side, these taste really good. They're sweetened with brown sugar, and dextrose and brown rice syrup. As for the chocolate, they are using some South American chocolate, so if you have issue with the child slaves working in the Ivory Coast chocolate farms, your conscious will be relieved. The taste overall is rich, chewy, and complex, mixing the chocolate, cherry and walnut flavors, in a whole wheat-corn-oat flour. Also, the bars have a lot of naturally occuring minerals and vitamins, including magnesium 10% and Iron 6%. Still, if I were thinking of buying a nutrician bar, I'd recommend a protein bar, that's vitamin fortafied.  If you are supplimenting a meal, or need a lunch box snack, etc, then these nutrition bars aren't a bad choice.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

When I went looking for it again in my area, not one of the stores that used to carry it had this brand anymore.  I looked on Amazon and they had the best price and availability.

I have tried many of the coffee substitutes but still haven't found one I like that is affordable.  (Why are they so expensive???)  I thought I'd try a different approach and see if a little coffee flavoring in my morning cocoa would make it taste more like a mocha.  I started with one capful, which I couldn't taste at all.

It really has a nice coffee taste.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nMae Ploy Green Curry Paste, 14 oz\nReview:\nI have Mae Ploy Yellow Curry and Panang Red Curry Paste and I love them.

I suppose it might work for cooking as the alcohol might cook off when baking.  However, it has 65% alcohol and coffee bean is listed as the last ingredient.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nMae Ploy Thai Panang Curry Paste - 14 oz jar\nReview:\nI love Thai food, but had never tried the Panang curry.  It is delicious.  After reading the reviews, I just had to try it.  It actually is not as spicy as I thought it would be. The first time I used it I measured less of it than the directions called for and it was kind of bland.  However, next time I will try the full amount.  Mae Ploy really makes Thai cooking easy.\n\nA few months down the road and this has become my favorite food.  I don't use coconut milk, because the thick canned kind at the grocery store leaves an aftertaste and makes me burp.  Instead, I use about 3/4 chicken broth for the liquid and it comes out just perfect.  My favorite way to use this is with Swai or similar fish fillets cut into bite sized pieces.  I stir fry whatever veggies I have on hand (red or green bell pepper, onion, shredded carrots, etc) and then remove them from the pan.  Next I fry the Thai Red Curry paste (I have found that 2 T. is perfect for me.  Spicy but not too hot) then I pour in the broth and let it sizzle for about a minute.  Next I add the fish and veggies and let it all simmer for about 10 minutes.  I serve it over rice or Thai noodles and it is heavenly. Not only does it taste wonderful, but the aroma lingers in my house for a day or two and smells delicious.  I'm so glad I found this.  I've stored it in the coldest part of my refrigerator and it has lasted several months with no sign of deterioration.  I use it about once a week.

So Since I am a big fan of Korean TV I just had to try this ramen! On the show Potato Star one musician character eats it a lot So I ordered it and BAM! No wonder these actors smile and totally whoof it down! It is definently woofable. So much so I couldn't believe how good it is! I did not cut up the green onion as you see on the top of the package, I should have bought some green onions and sliced them thin and added to the top, but its fine without, more than fine without! Love this stuff. Okay so its spicy...not jalapeno spicey staying in your mouth needing a tortilla or milk to get your tongue back hot, its all together hot in a different way the kind of good hot for hot lovers. Makes you really want more. So spicy and hot with the red chili powder and its smooth and the broth you just want to drink it! Noodles have a great texture not all overly soft, they are firm and really taste better than the typical ramen I buy at my grocery store. Plus you put the water in the bowl, close the lid and when you open the bowl you won't believe the soup its like totally full of noodles like way more than the average ramen. At first the ramen looks all whimpy small and man or man it balloons out to fill the bowl.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNongShim Bowl Noodle Soup, Kimchi, 3.03 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThe absolute best spicy ramen.

I love rosemary and I am not so sure this spice works with the Flax. I am really unsure what would go with this cracker, its really not something you would eat plain.

Nicely canned, has a great flavor and when they can this stuff they just put the meat and the salt cube in the can and fire it up cooking it right in the can so the natural juices are actually from the meat itself. If anyone knows how canning is done, that is basically how commercial canning is done so do not let that freak you out if you eat tuna it is cooked in the can. The source of this meat is from the Ohio Valley which I do not know if you all care where your meat comes from but as we all know the fears of eating anything from China verses something made right here in the USA well.... that is a big plus. Our meat inspectors are involved, nuff said. The cons sure... one can if your Malmart carries this product I am in Colorado and no Malmart carries this meat, yours might Mine does not. Even if I order directly from Keystone which is located in Lima, Ohio, I would pay as much for shipping to Colorado than thru Amazon because of the distance. Now if I lived in the North East I might save 15 dollars on a case allotment thru Keystone and they do let you mix and match up the meats but you have to buy like 12 at a time and its like $110 but for me again I pay the same and it is nice to get it two or three cans at a time as I stock up and continue to build my food storage and using it as well, too keep the storage of this product from spoilage. The only real con and it almost makes me want to take away five stars is.. when Amazon is out they make this price $28 and when they have it in stock the price goes back down. I am not sure why this is the situation here, most frustrating. Initially when I saw that I called the company direct and almost ordered there. Amazon needs to stop doing that, it only pushes people to find another source to purchase when the price doubles for no reason.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'one', 'product', 'would', 'salt', 'milk', 'hot', 'great', 'use', 'coffee']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\n Cameron&#39;s Coffee Roasted Whole Bean Coffee, Flavored, Chocolate Caramel Brownie, 12 Ounce (Pack of 3) \nReview:\nPretty good stuff.

Bag\nReview:\nFoolish and dumb as this may sound, I'd forgotten what impact caffeine has on various health issues - primarily raising my ocular pressure - and that can be serious for those with Glaucoma and other medical eye issues.\nNew job; new pressures; stress; longer hours; inclement weather, and I was brewing more coffee and having more refills; taking bigger travel mugs and not thinking about it. I was using a higher quality of coffee and had read many articles about how organic; higher quality, etc really has more to do with how coffee affects/doesn't affect someone than the actual caffeine component, so I felt I was \"okay\" with drinking more of it. Wrong (at least for me).\nI had forgotten how I used to mix my coffee half and half with Teeccino and that cut down the caffeine. Teeccino's a great product, but it is not very cost effective for me, and I prefer something without the gluten.\n\nIn the past, I tried the packets of Dandy Blend and it was ok. They quickly hardened and dried out so I threw away the unused packets.\nI had received some very bad news from my Ophthalmologist, so back to the drawing board and saw this 2# bag of Dandy Blend, with outstanding reviews and comments and thought I'd give it a go again. After all, it's a MUST!\nNot only is it gluten-free (and they explain on their site 'how' that is); but dandelions are great for the liver which is very closely related to eye issues - they go hand in hand. (I already take Milk Thistle every day for my liver, so this will be an added bonus!)\n\nThen I asked all of you a few questions on the Q/A area (great feature, and big help!). I wanted to be able to brew Dandy Blend along with a scoop of regular coffee grounds (as I did with Teeccino) and you all told me how I could. Score!\nSo, right now I'm enjoying a delicious cup - or two, or three - of mixed brew and eventually will cut out the coffee altogether.\nI was too chicken to put the DB in the brew basket, so I used my normal amount of water for the pot; only put in one scoop of coffee, instead of two, and then when it was finished brewing, I added one rounded tablespoon to the pot and stirred it in.\nFABULOUS!\nThe recipes and ideas on both the bag and the website are great - I would have never thought of doing that. Now I look forward to trying it. I'm getting ready to do some traveling, so will bring some with me.\n\nFolks - we can monitor our BLOOD pressure at home (which I occasionally do); but we cannot monitor our own ocular pressure. Hopefully, one day, it will be possible to do. Fortunately for me, I HAVE to go regularly to keep a close watch on it; but I was without insurance and took my chances and it was almost disastrous. Please be sure to get your eyes checked regularly, especially to check your pressures. It's still the leading cause of blindness.\n\n*****One week later****\nI only mixed with coffee for one week.

Here are my thoughts both positive and otherwise.\n\n1) Easily accessible product - found my box at Walmart, for $4.50.\n2) The ingredients are self contained in the box; other than eggs, choice of fat; and liquid.\n3) I like that you have options: water or milk or almond milk, etc; eggs or egg white; various oils or butter\n4) This should easily be touted as another great \"no knead\" bread - just mix and pour.\n5) I like that it gives the options of oven baking or bread machine. I don't have a bread machine so I made mine in the oven.\n6) It rose very quickly and there are not several stages to wait through - just the one rising time.\n7) It was done very quickly.\n8) The bread makes a nice size loaf and slices well, without crumbling\n9) Each slice of bread holds up well to spreading and doesn't tear even when buttering with cold, hard butter - no tearing\n10) The flavor is good enough on its own, but I could also see how adding other ingredients would really be welcome, too. I can see why all the positive remarks that this is probably one of the best GF breads out there.\n\nAnd now for my other comments:\n\nWhile it is Gluten-free, it is not starch free (nor does it claim to be, either). I have a hard time, these days digesting ALL grains, and starches sometimes bother me, too. So, while the ingredients were very clearly stated, I chose to buy the product anyway just to see how well I would 'do' with this particular bread and whether or not to stay with it, or move on to Paleo breads, which are gluten free, as well as grain AND starch free. Only time will tell how I feel after eating this bread.\nMy other comment is that it contains corn starch, and as 80-90% of corn in the US is genetically modified, I'm wondering if that is true with this item as well?\n\nNonetheless, I was pleased with all of its attributes, and if/when I make it again, I'll be sure and not let it brown as much - keep an eye on it! :)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWild Planet Wild Skipjack Tuna (Light Tuna), 5 oz Cans (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nYum, Yum!\nBought it first to try and just now subscribed!\nIt's delicious!

They taste so much better.\n\nBut, I was reading some reviews and saw some comments that the pink salt had fluoride and had all these warnings on it! Well, that made me nervous because I try and avoid fluoride (don't use fluoride toothpaste, etc.). I was so disappointed.\n\nBut, I read further that the fluoride is not 'added', is not the same as the dangerous fluoride found in our water system here, but rather, naturally occurring. I didn't do a whole lot of research about this, but since that made me happy, I ordered it.\n\nI really do love it, and prefer it over all the others, although the grey is nice as well.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCHIQUILIN Smoked Paprika, 75 GR\nReview:\nI have been the blessed recipient of the most amazing eggplant parmesan recipe on this planet! The recipe takes three non-stop hours in the kitchen to make and it is so worth it.\nWhen my friend gave me the recipe, she said that there are two specific ingredients that are a \"must\" and that is why it is a knock-your-socks-off killer recipe. The smoked paprika was one of them.\nSo, I turned to Amazon to see what you all have said about smoked paprika and which one I should get because this dish was going to be the \"star of the show\" at a dinner party and I wanted a good one.\nOh, ba-by! This smoked paprika is smokin'!\nNot only did I use it to make my EP dish, but I have since used it in some regular standby dishes (such as a bean, kale and sausage soup) and it put that recipe into orbit! Now I won't make it without the smoked paprika!\nYou gotta get it! It will take a recipe over the top to the next level and you will be so delighted.

I need to find a way to make them stay softer (with traditional cookies I would toss a piece of bread in the bucket-unfortunately we are gf now-so that doesn't exactly work...) I let my cookies cool for 5 mins on the pan-maybe I will do 3 next time.

It's overly expensive, weak quality, and wasteful. So whether you use a \"My K Cup\" adapter, or this Solofill (or some other brand) that enables you to use your own coffee, that's a choice you really need to make.\n\nI had used a \"My K Cup\" for a long time. But the mesh was finally wearing through and so I wanted to give something new a try.\n\nThe advantage for the Solofill:\n\nMUCH less spraying and extra water into the cup, which means overall better tasting coffee and less mess. This is because you will use the original K-Cup pod in the Keurig (unlike the \"My K Cup\" which is a seperate adapter). So it's designed to fit like a K-Cup, and it doesn't have the problems with the spraying.\n\nThis is a BIG plus.\n\nThe disadvantages, which to be fair are mostly annoyances, but still...\n\nA pain to clean. Unlike the \"My K Cup,\" which had multiple parts and was easy to flick the old grounds out of, this requires you have to dig into the grounds to get them out. Then, the little divot at the bottom needs some extra spray to come clean.\n\nThe lid does not have a lip to open it, so you have to be careful it doesn't open and spill grounds everywhere.\n\nOverall, it's okay - but I'm all about convenience, and the aggravations push it to three stars instead of four...but someone else might see it differently.\n\nI don't see any significant difference in coffee taste. I drink coffee black, and it tastes about the same to me. It SHOULD be a little stronger without the extra water, but I don't notice.\n\nIn fact - another reviewer noticed that the water might go through TOO quickly, which makes it water. I'm not sure - but it's possible.\n\nUPDATE, Feb. 27, 2013: I hiked the rating to four stars from three. I've been using it for awhile, and I like it - I still don't like the cleaning, but overall I'm having no problems with spillover and I think it distributes the water through the coffee grounds more effectively.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I was not expecting a liquid mess when I opened the jar but that is what I got, all over my jacket and floor. It has a consistency better suited to pouring than spreading. Perhaps if being used for drinks this would be acceptable but it doesn't work well as a spread or a dip. As far as the taste goes, it is edible but I didn't find it appealing.

The nuts themselves are delicious and I have nothing against peanuts if it is priced accordingly.  My other complaint is that it comes in a re-sealable bag that does not close properly. I had the same problem with another of the Happy Belly snack line. Their \"Ziploc\" seals are not of good quality and require the use of a chip clip.

Because it is listed as good for sipping I tried it that way as well and it was very good. I also really like that it comes in 1 cup portions which is great for recipes.

They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.\n\nIn summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nKuli Kuli Moringa Green Energy Shots, Raspberry, 12 Count, 2.5 Ounce Shots (12 Count), Natural Energy from Green Tea &amp; Leafy Green Superfood, Contains Caffeine, Equals Half Cup Vegetables\nReview:\nFirst off, it tastes awful.

There are no less than seven daffiness kinds of plain dry roast Planters peanuts. Why they decided to put so many chemicals and additives into some is astonishing. One of the worst is the large party size that contains monosodium glutamate or MSG (also known as \"Natural Ingredients\") which is an excito-toxin to the neurons of the brain, which overstimulates neurons making your brain think that the nuts taste better than they actually do. The neurons die of overstimulation. I don't know about you but I need all the neurons I have just to function these days.\n\nThe key to good healthy peanuts is to read the label and choose the canister with the fewest ingredients. Its kind of a bite since the font on the labels is so small, but for our health that is what we must now do until Planters simplifies things by not adding junk to the nuts.\n\nHere is the link on Amazon to the one Planters Dry Roast that ingredients listed are only PEANUTS!

Just as other reviewers have noted, these bars are quite tasty and they don't make me feel bloated, cramped, or uncomfortable in any way. Of course they contain some manmade ingredients (i.e., artificial flavoring) but they're still superior to candy bars. The \"chocolatey peanut butter\" flavor is quite good and these bars stay fresh a while after you pick up a box or two of them. Great!\n\nTrue, there's some saturated fat in these bars but overall they're still good for me; they help me stay regular and that's a huge plus.\n\nI highly recommend these Fiber Plus antioxidant bars from Kellogg's. The \"chocolatey peanut butter\" flavor makes them practically habit-forming!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Chocolate, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nThese power bars in that mixed berry blast flavor are tasty and delicious! True, I have to take a few minutes to chew them--they're not something I can eat very quickly, they're too chewy for that. Most importantly, but they are very  helpful to me when I exercise. For example, they are excellent for a power boost shortly before I exercise; and they help me replenish the salt I lose when I perspire both during and shortly after exercising.\n\nSome will say that these bars really give you protein while others maintain that these bars don't have enough protein. They do have 6 grams of protein per bar so I guess it becomes an individual decision when it comes to just how much protein you want; you could have two bars before a workout or running if extra protein is what you want.\n\nOverall, these bars are great. I love them! They are excellent for athletes and anyone serious about working out, but of course they can be enjoyed as a snack if you wish.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKellogg's Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars (Raspberry, 8-Count Bars, Pack of 6)\nReview:\nKellogg's Nutri Grain cereal bars make for a tasty snack and they are good for when you need quick energy and you're \"on the go.\" They are perfect when you don't have time to eat something more substantial to get quick energy. The price at which Amazon offers them is affordable compared to what my local supermarket charges. These strawberry flavored bars are low in fat and cholesterol, too--a great plus! Moreover, they are even \"certified kosher\" if that matters to you. Moreover, these bars are both chewy and satisfying  SMILE\n\nHowever, this cereal bar is not perfect. Each bar contains 26 grams of carbohydrates and 13 grams of sugar; sugar can sometimes turn into fat in your body. These amounts of carbohydrates and sugar are a lot for a comparatively small cereal bar! Moreover, this food bar is not for anyone on a salt free diet as it contains some salt; and people with allergies to wheat or milk should consult their doctor before they eat this food.\n\nThese bars go down better if you eat them with juice, milk or water. I eat them with water or apple juice myself.\n\nOverall, the strawberry flavored Nutri Grain cereal bars are useful for those of us who are not allergic to any of their ingredients and who want a healthy alternative to a regular breakfast or a candy bar. The Amazon price makes them affordable and I also recommend them as a nutritious snack food that is especially good for people on the run. They are far superior to any candy bar!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFruit Harvest Cereal, Strawberry Blueberry, 12.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nKellogg's Fruit Harvest Strawberry Blueberry packs a huge punch with a great taste and it contains no fat, no trans fats and no cholesterol. It is relatively low in sugar and carbohydrates, too.\n\nDespite the fact that this is one of the best tasting breakfast cereals out there I am disappointed in its vitamin content. The artwork on the box leads you to believe that this cereal just has to be very healthy for you. Yes, it has 25 % of your recommended daily intake of iron, niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, riboflavin, thiamin and folic acid; but I expected this product to be healthier still. I will take off one star for that to make this a four star review.\n\nIt is low in sugar just as they say it is. However, if you aren't getting the proper amount of exercise you need, then the extra sugar in the strawberries, blueberries and corn syrup could turn into sugar inside your body. As always, when planning a diet, it helps to consult your physician before starting a new diet.\n\nNevertheless, the strawberries and blueberries taste delicious--even when you eat this dry and drink milk along with it. Kellogg's Fruit Harvest Cereal offers whole grain which is an important part of any healthy diet.\n\nOverall, Kellogg's Fruit Harvest Strawberry Blueberry breakfast cereal is a great choice to start your day. Sure, it may not be the absolute healthiest cereal on your grocer's shelf but this cereal beats junk food by a mile. Buy some and enjoy today!\n\nSMILE\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nProduct 19 Cereal, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nProduct 19 is an excellent breakfast cereal. It has absolutely no fat, no trans fat, no cholesterol, and it is rather low in sugar content. Excellent! Product 19 even has 100% of vitamins C, E, B12, B16, iron and other nutrients as well. Very impressive! (Amazon states that it has only 10% of these nutrients but that is incorrect.)\n\nOn the other hand, the cereal is low in fiber and it contains sodium and carbohydrates. Check the label to see if you're comfortable with the amounts of ALL the ingredients in this cereal before buying it. Product 19 is something that grew on me; I initially didn't like it but I kept eating it in the morning for health reasons. Over time I appreciated the taste more and more. This may be true for you, too. Not everyone will find this cereal to be tasty the very first time they eat it. You could add a few strawberries or blueberries on top of the cereal to make it sweeter; these berries are also very healthy for you, too.\n\nThe packaging is attractive. The sealed plastic bag inside the box keeps the cereal fresh even a couple of months beyond the expiration date on the box.\n\nOverall, Product 19 is an excellent cereal for people who care about what they eat. It may take a little getting used to because of the taste and the consistency of the cereal flakes. Despite the \"taste factor\" and a few drawbacks concerning sodium and carbohydrates, I highly recommend this cereal as part of a healthy diet.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nRitz Crackers, 10 Count, 37.7 Ounce\nReview:\nRitz crackers by Nabisco have always been one of my favorites. I remember eating them in kindergarten at snack time--I always wanted a couple extra! These crackers have stood the test of time because they are very tasty and great to eat as a snack.\n\nRitz crackers are rather low in fat (4.5 grams of fat per serving) and they have almost no carbohydrates. They are cholesterol free as well--hooray! In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you. The nutrition label indicates that there are no trans-fats but I did notice a bit of partially hydrogenated ingredients on the label--it may be that the amount of trans-fats this generates is negligible.\n\nRitz crackers can be eaten by themselves but feel free to get creative! They can help out when it's time to make snacks for company. Just put a bit of cheese (or melted cheese and ham) on them and you're serving up great appetizers or snack in no time! They go great with a little bit of butter on them, too.\n\nOverall, Ritz crackers really hit the spot when I crave a snack before bedtime. I simply take a slice of two of regular cheese and place little bits of the cheese on top of the crackers and with a small beverage it's awesome!\n\nI highly recommend Ritz crackers as one of the healthier crackers that will satisfy you, too. Great!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGatorade Performance Series Carbohydrate Energy Formula, Wild Berry, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nGatorade performance series carbohydrate energy formula is not my favorite tasting beverage; but for the athletes amongst us it can sure make excellent sense to drink this stuff! I am no athlete; I only drink this sporadically. This drink is best suited for people who train intensively and people who compete in sporting competitions. It's essentially a \"high octane\" version of regular Gatorade. It does have a somewhat pleasant berry, fruity taste to it that is enhanced by huge amounts of sugar. If the taste isn't too great, try to refrigerate this before drinking it. Leave any leftover Gatorade refrigerated for best taste and nutritional value.\n\nGatorade comes in a firm plastic bottle with a cap that screws on and off for easy drinking. It contains 79 grams of carbs that you will probably lose if you're really exercising a lot. In addition, this type of Gatorade has sodium (ouch) BUT it will rehydrate you fast after you work out. It may also be helpful to drink Gatorade if you have diarrhea; ask your doctor about this. It's also worth noting that this type of Gatorade contains 25% of the recommended daily intake of niacin, B6, and pantothenic acid\n\nIn addition, Gatorade can give you an energy boost without making you lose sleep; this is because Gatorade has sugar but no caffeine.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Gatorade as more than just a snack drink. Gatorade helps you to rehydrate after you sweat a lot during a work out or some type of sporting competition; and it gives you an energy boost as well while replenishing any carbohydrates you may have lost doing exercise. It may also be beneficial when you're on chemotherapy (as I am) to balance out your body's system. I believe that this type of Gatorade also contains electrolytes that can be beneficial to your system.\n\nIf you have any questions about Gatorade ask your doctor before drinking this beverage.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nGatorade Performance Series Carbohydrate Energy Formula, Orange, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nGatorade performance series carbohydrate energy formula is not my favorite tasting beverage; but it sure makes excellent sense to drink the stuff!

These raisins are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.\n\nHowever, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They are relatively high in sugar (29 grams per 1/4 cup) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.\n\nHowever, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these raisins are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that the raisins do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily.\n\nThese raisins are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. These 1.5-ounce cartons provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.\n\nHighly recommended--to life!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Packets, 400 Count\nReview:\nSplenda is a wonderful sweetener for beverages like coffee or iced tea. An individual packet has no calories; and the packet is also low in carbohydrates. It uses sucralose as a sugar substitute.\n\nI used to prefer Sweet `N Low; but these days I far prefer Splenda as a substitute for sugar which is definitely not on my diet! Splenda is my number one choice because it makes coffee or tea very sweet without the negatives of sugar that some people have to watch, including myself because of the diet I must adhere to these days.\n\nSplenda is a powdery white substance. Just open an individual packet (or two) and pour it in to your beverage. It is probably quite good for certain recipes as well. You may prefer to use the granular form of Splenda for certain recipes but if you don't have granular Splenda handy these packets just might do the trick. Keep the individual packets in the box they come in or you can put them into any container you wish.\n\nThe only negative I can think of is that you may want to look elsewhere for a sugar substitute if you need to watch your intake of carbohydrates. Depending on how much Splenda the recipe calls for (or how much Splenda you use in your daily beverages) there might be too many carbohydrates in larger amounts of Splenda for you. If you're watching your carbs, ask your doctor what to use as a sugar substitute.\n\nOverall, Splenda is still a very good substitute for sugar. I used to prefer Sweet `N Low but over time I changed my mind.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['cereal', 'sugar', 'great', 'good', 'tea', 'taste', 'coffee', 'eat', 'also', 'overall']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nNescafe Taster's Choice Instant Coffee, Decaffeinated, .059-Ounce Single Sticks, 80-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nGood taste; no guilt.

The Bi Yan Pian disolves mucus from allergy reactions thereby letting your body get rid of the toxins.

This one is my favorite over most others because it is actually raw and has a Dark Chocolate flavor. It blends well in smoothies and my non dairy lattes. In the morning I use 1/2 tablespoon in my Organic Hemp Smoothie. With this added it tastes more like a desert drink than just a healthy shake. I use pure Stevia extract (no other ingredients) to sweeten the drink. Only 1 very tiny spoon is enough for about 15 oz for me. I am presently using the Dukan Diet 1 oz bottle available on Amazon. Cacao is what Chocolate is made from, the less sugar the Darker the Chocolate. When I refer to a Dark Chocolate taste I mean 85% or Darker. Of course you can sweeten it to taste. Adding a good dark chocolate or unsweetened Cacao to your diet is not only delicious but has many health benefits as well. It provides fiber, iron, Magnesium, Copper & Manganese. It also contains potassium, phosphorus, zinc and selenium. Cacao as well as Chocolate contains caffeine so helps you in the morning but is unlikely to have the effects of Coffee. I started doing a shake in the morning for health benefits now I look forward to it. My recipe various somewhat but basically I use a non dairy milk such as Almond or Coconut or a combination of both, 1/2 tablespoon of Cacao, 1/4 teaspoon of Cinnamon, Stevia & 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of a Protein Hemp Powder. I vary adding 1/2 teaspoon of Maca, Matcha Tea Powder, Beet Powder, Berries etc. to mix it up a bit. After blending I use a couple of ounces of tea to rinse out the blender. I find I am looking & feeling better and my energy and morning brain fog has improved greatly which I contribute to the Cacao. While many brands sell Cacao finding a raw one is more difficult and being raw I find the taste richer and fuller. The bag it came is a very strong resealable attractive bag and the product I received has an expiry of January 2018.

It arrived to me quickly and in fresh condition from Amazon.\n\nOrganic Mekong Flower Rice(tm) - Cambodia's Floral Brown Rice, Imported from Cambodia\n\nMekong Flower is called 'Phka Malis' in Khmer, which means beautiful garland of flowers, because of its delicate floral aroma. Leaving the germ and bran layer intact intensifies its fragrance and nutty flavor while retaining the highest nutritional value. This nourishing whole grain rice has a lovely supple texture - unlike the chewy and bland taste of some brown rice.\n\nPerfect in dishes that will showcase its delicate fragrance, Mekong Flower is nutritious and flavorful.\n\nPerfect for all cuisines, it can be used steamed plain, in a pilaf, stir-fry, salad or pudding.\n\nMekong Flower is chiefly grown on small family plots by households belonging to the Damrei Romeal Organic Rice Cooperatives in Takeo, a province dominated by rice fields and sugar palm trees. Cooperative members are using a set of growing methods, called the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), which enable smallholder farmers to harvest more rice from their traditional varieties using less water, seed, land and no chemicals. Researchers have found that the major aromatic compound in rice is increased in response to water stress. With SRI, farmers drain their paddies periodically, which may explain why Cambodian consumers are saying that SRI-grown 'Phka Malis' is more aromatic and better tasting. Visit our SRI section to learn more about this amazing system that is transforming the rice-growing world.\n\n# Cooks in 30 minutes\n# Whole grain and heart healthy\n# High in fiber, trace minerals and vitamins\n# High in phytonutrients and antioxidants\n# 3rd year transition, organic certification\n# Fair trade\n# Gluten and wheat free\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I attribute this to the company's careful packaging as well as Amazon's protective cushioning for shipping.  Even the metal cookie box was undented/unscathed.  The cookies (I've tried 3) are fresh/crisp with delicious Belgian chocolate.  These cookies are less sweet than traditional  commercial American cookies which makes them a tasty treat with a cup of tea or coffee, and a better compliment to hot cocoa.  (Sometimes our cookies with hot cocoa are just too sweet for me.)\n\nI ordered these about 1-6-17.  The expiration date is 7-31-17.  (I included this because some have asked about expiration. )  I am pretty certain these will freeze ok so may freeze some.  I am tempted to reorder to have some later in the year when it's too hot to ship....but I think I will use them as a treat to look forward to next Christmas.  Definitely will buy again!  Also the tin is totally free of any print including the bottom.  It is has a plain red bottom with a red top which has a paint swirl pattern reminiscent of flower petals.  All the info is included on a plastic wrapper which encircled the tin which also kept the lid in place during shipping.  This is definitely a nice box for a variety of things like cards/stamps, sewing supplies, hair accessories..maybe love letters :)  Box size is 11 x 7.75 x 3.75 inches (last two are a smidge less than full length).\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['one', 'flavor', 'good', 'fresh', 'would', 'first', 'product', 'definitely', 'cookies', 'treat']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nHealthworks Cacao Powder Organic, 1lb\nReview:\nGreat product.

They are a fun product from my childhood memories.  They are very sweet, however.  I had been eating higher quality malt balls (from expensive chocolate stores) as an adult and the sweetness on these is a little overwhelming for me.  But, they were still fun and great to take to the movies.  If you like Whoppers, this was a great package at a great price.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFoodShouldTasteGood Sweet Potato Tortilla Chips, 5.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese are excellent chips.  I have enjoyed them in larger bags and was happy to find these affordable smaller bags, as they are so good that I can easily eat the whole bag if I buy a big bag! They arrived fast and very fresh.  I also love that they are gluten free, so I was able to recommend them to my nephew.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTorani Dark Chocolate Sauce, 16.5 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI am really enjoying this.  I hate overly sweet or \"fake tasting\" chocolate in my coffee, so most store-bought mocha drinks annoy me.  Yet, I love the really good ones.  This allows me to have the taste of the best mocha drinks, hot and cold, at home for a fraction of the price!  I never thought I could use a six pack by myself, but it has a long shelf life so I expect to have no problem!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTwizzlers Licorice Candy, Halloween Candy, Hershey Chocolate, 12 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI enjoy this flavor and it is not always available in the stores.  I was thrilled to see these.  They arrived very fresh and perfect.  The problem was that it was too good!  I ended up giving away half of them because I was eating them too fast!  The recipients loved it as well, so we were all happy!

I have had it several weeks (there is a lot in this order) and it still tastes very fresh, so it apparently has a very long shelf life.  Best of all, the licorice itself is delicious.  It has a very strong and clean licorice flavor.  I will definitely buy again.  Because of this, I gave it the full 5 stars.  However, I was concerned with the way that it was shipped.  It came as loose bars!  They were scattered throughout my shipping box along with my other items.  However, I did report this to Amazon and they were great about it.

As such, with this high a cocoa content, it is not sweet, and is a little bitter.  But, for some of us, that is a GOOD thing!  I am really enjoying it.

I am really glad that I tried this,  I was not interested in the extra effort of using the whole beans, and this is so much better than extract.  I can't imagine ever going back to extract!

We add it to ALL baking and everyone loves it. Example: We use this meal INSTEAD OF FAT in muffins and they are moist and delicious! For instance, if the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of oil, we substitute 1/2 cup of golden flax seed meal. Its that simple. The muffins (regardless of the type) turn out tasty and stay fresh for days! This is a MUCH better fatty fiber than any other you could add to baking. Plus, golden flax seed meal SATISFIES! You will require less food when you eat it. PLEASE NOTE - something seldom mentioned about FLAX - it is a laxative! - so add it to your diet slowly, or you may regret it. Flax calms your appetite, aids digestion, fills you up, regulates your bowels, gives STAMINA, and is a great source of Omega III fatty acids, among other things. It adds more value to your diet, naturally, than anything else you've ever tried! Your health will improve SO much after a few weeks of using this meal, you will never stop using it!

This gift made me feel really special and loved. I know it is the thought that counts but when it's chocolate and this delicious, that counts even more!

Somebody had eaten all of my malted milk balls and left the carton on the counter. I was mad but as usual I got over it. I will try that recipe some other time.

Hershey's nuggets are perfect for me. You get a variety of choices when you select this assortment. I like all of them and usually don't peek when I reach into the bag. That way I get a pleasant surprise. I probably like the dark chocolate the best but I enjoy all of the choices. If you eat two of three pieces of chocolate, you don't feel so piggy which is another good thing. I find that one piece of chocolate usually satisfies me so this bag lasts a while. It is a good choice for my family. Hersheys just make a very good product that continues to maintain a very excellent product.

We enjoy corn flakes quite a lot. The crunch is good. The flavor is good. The price is good, too. Sometimes at night we indulge in a tasty bowl of cornflakes as we sit by the flickering light of the television as a special treat to ourselves. I have caught family members just enjoying corn flakes by the handful just out of the box. Any of those ways is pretty good. There is one more thing that I do with corn flakes. I make delicious corn flake cookies. These have to be made on a day that is not rainy or damp as egg whites have to be whipped with the corn flakes gently folded in and baked in a low oven.

However, as another reviewer has said, some of the flavors were impressive and others were not, although it is also a matter of personal taste.  I was impressed with two flavors, the Maple Pecan and the Brownie.  I also liked the Coconut Shortbread.  I did not care for the other flavors much.  I ended up buying the Maple Pecan and Brownie flavors again, separately.  Overall what you are getting is a soft, chewy treat that is shaped like a cookie but is more substantial in terms of density, flavor and nutritional content.  These cookies are a good source of healthy carbs, fat, and fiber and are not too sweet.  There are two cookies per individual package.  I will typically eat one of the two cookies at a sitting and save the 2nd one for later.  They are rich and satisfying and make a good mid-day snack or breakfast bar.  I do wish they were less expensive though.  However if price is no deterrent, it is hard to beat these for a healthy, enjoyable paleo snack.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.\n\nIf you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly on the \"best before\" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get \"expired\" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso.

It's NOT stale, unnatural, gummy, flat, tough, phony, bitter, sour, or just plain \"off\" in taste or texture.  Then again, it's not fresh apple pie either.\n\nHowever, the predominant notes are cinnamon and raisins with some raw oat-y undertones, and it's comforting to discover that these are among the ingredients--70% of which are organic.  There is a slight apple-like undertone, but that may be by association, the cinnamon scent reminds one of pumpkins, coffee cake, waffles, and more. It's slightly chewy, but easily eaten and not dry.  The oats (especially) and walnuts add to the texture, although I didn't detect much walnut flavor (although there was that \"waffle\"-like taste). At any rate, the combination of flavors is excellent, making this an actually enjoyable little treat!\n\nIngredients: Organic Brown Rice Syrup, ClifProTM (Soy Rice Crisps [Soy Protein Isolate, Rice Flour, Malt Extract], Organic Roasted Soybeans, Organic Soy Flour), Organic Rolled Oats, Raisins, Walnuts, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, ClifCrunchTM (Organic Oat Fiber, Chicory Extract, Organic Flaxseed, Psyllium), Organic Oat Bran, Molasses Powder, Natural Flavors, Ground Cinnamon, Sea Salt\n\nNutritional Facts: (Amount per serving is followed by % of daily value) Total Fat: 5 g, 8%;Saturated Fat: 1 g; 4% Trans Fat: 0 gr; Cholesterol 0 mg, Sodium 130 mg, 5%; Potassium 310 mg, 9%;Total Carbohydrates: 43 g, 14%; Dietary Fiber: 5 g, 20%; Insoluble Fiber: 3 g; Sugars: 20 g; Other Carbohydrates 18 g; Protein 10 g  20%.\n\nThe Clif website also reports that \"Walnuts are a source of Omega-3s\"  (there are 400mg of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids per serving), but adds (or their lawyers add): \"Supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. One CLIF BAR provides 400mg of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids. \"\n\nOther nutritional information.  Clif adds enough supplemental ingredients it begins to resemble an enormous,  good-tasting, multivitamin. While you don't get 100% of your recommended daily values (based on a 2,000-calorie diet), you get a pretty fair dose: Vitamin A 30%, C 100%, E 100%, K, 25%,  Thiamin 25% Riboflavin 15% Niacin 15% B6  20% , Folate 20%, B12 15%, Biotin 10%, Calcium 25%, Iron 25%, Pantothenic Acid 20%, Phosphorus 20%, Iodine  15%, Magnesium 25%, Zinc 20%,  Selenium 20%, Copper 15%, Manganese 35%, Chromium 10%, Molybdenum 15%.\n\nWhile I would have preferred that the best, most natural flavor is chocolate, I'll still recommend these, but I'm taking a break from consuming or reviewing them for a while.  Bon appetit!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCLIF BAR - Energy Bar - Apricot - (2.4 Ounce Protein Bar, 12 Count)\nReview:\nMain Points:\n\nMuch better then their \"Nutrition\" line peanut butter bar, the \"regular\" chocolate brownie bar has a rich flavor and a chewy, slightly nutty, substantial texture.  Unfortunately, there is an aftertaste that belies the initial flavor jolt, and-once tasted-it becomes more prominent. There's a raisiny, plum-y sort of taste (which may come from the figs inside) that threatens the chocolate integrity. Overall, however, it's quite tasty, filling, and eminently portable.\n\nIngredients:\n\nClif Bars feature organic, healthy ingredients, heavy on soy products. The ingredients include (as listed) organic brown rice syrup, organic rolled oats, \"Clifpro\" (a blend of soy protein isolate, rice flour, malt extract, organic roasted soybeans, organic soy flour), organic evaporated cane sugar, chocolate chips, fig paste, organic soy butter, cocoa, organic milled flaxseed, chicory, sea salt, Dutch cocoa, other natural flavors, and a pharmacopoeia of vitamins and minerals.\n\nNutrition:\n\nAnalysis of a 68-gram bar reveals the following:\n\nCalories 240; Calories from Fat, 40; Total Fat, 4.5 grams; Saturated Fat, 1.5 g; Protein, 10 g; Dietary Fiber, 5g; Insoluble Fiber, 4g; Sugars, 20g; and Total Carbohydrates, 45g; and Sodium, 150mg. (This is basically comparable to the horrendous tasting Nutrition Crunchy Peanut Butter Bar mentioned above.) There are 100% of Daily Requirements of Vitamins C and E, and about 15-35% of many other vitamins and minerals (most of which are added directly to the product-see list above). Here's a nutritional comparison with the Clif \"Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup\":\n\nCalories 220, Fat Calories 20, Total Fat (g) 2.5, Sat.

Fat content is a little bit higher than their Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, although this product has a bit more protein. While I can't give nutritional recommendations, I hope the information above is helpful.  The taste and texture are very good for this kind of product.

It has just enough chocolate (from chocolate chips, see ingredient list) to impart a chocolate flavor. Not a heavy or rich chocolate flavor, but an unmistakable one: You don't have to close your eyes, and convince yourself that it's chocolate.\n\nThis has a \"Bit-O-Honey\" -like chewy texture with honey overtones. Throw in some sticky peanut butter and chocolate, and you've pretty much captured the flavor. To my surprise, however, there is no honey. Clif gets that taste from syrups, malt, cane juice, fig paste, and other sweet ingredients.\n\nIt's definitely filling, especially if accompanied by an apple or something, and at least eight ounces of water.  While chewy, it doesn't seem as dry as similar products. Could it be the six grams of fat-two of which are saturated?  Made with 70% organic ingredients, this bar has a whopping 11 grams of protein, only 20 grams of sugar (compare that with other brands and flavors), and includes five grams of fiber. Along with Clif's Z-bar and the excellent Clif apple raisin walnut, this is one of the better tasting of its kind--just don't expect a brownie.\n\nIngredients at the time of this review.

Although nothhing tastes like a blueberry as much as a blueberry, once you adjust (about 4 initial mouthfuls) the KIND version of blueberry, you'll not only love the taste, but it will seem close enough to the real thing that you'll have a Blueberry Experience!  NOt too crunchy, yet not too soft or crumbly, these have a great blueberry/flax/cinnamon flavor which I loved. (Non-cinnamon fans should stay away).\n\nThe product is slightly pricey, but this is offset by how filling it is--especially when consumed with water.  I'd recommend this as a pick-me-up/snack almost anytime,; for example, while at the office, on a hike, taking a break from a bike ride, etc. The ingredients tasted fresh (one unlucky reviewer reported a \"rancid\" ingredient). Overall a very tasty and satisfying snack food.  Highly recommended!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWorcestershire Sauce, Organic, 6.25 oz.\nReview:\nAnnie's, the friendly company, makes this fine organic and vegetarian Worcestershire Sauce (it appears that other products have anchovies in them, hence their non-vegetarian status). Made in the beautiful state of Vermont (not too far from Ben and Jerry's) this apple cider vinegar, molasses, soy sauce based product adds a lot of dark spicy flavor to stir fries, hamburgers (I'm imagining here that you'll probably get soy burgers, and anything needing a sweet/sour/spicy kick to it. As suggested above, great in sauces and stews too.\n\nIn each large (perhaps recipe-based) 2 tablespoon serving (about seven servings per container), you get the following nutritional components:\n\n20 calories, no fat, 460 mg. of sodium, 5 grams of carbohydrate (four of which are sugars), and bit of protein (< than 1 gram). Other information about Annie's company and products are on the web at anniesnaturals.com\n\nHint: For more fun, teach some youngsters to spell \"Worcestershire,\" show them where it is on the map, and read \"The Wind in the Willows\" to them!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYork Peppermint Patties Dark Chocolate Covered Mint Candy, 66.7 Ounce\nReview:\nYes, this is the candy that inspired the name of Patricia Peppermint Patty of Peanuts, (she's the likable, intelligent, assertive one) who pitched a no-hitter and clobbered 5 home runs in one game (and pitched a no-hit, 50-0 game which Charlie Brown lost for her with just one out), who got a D- on every one of her school assignments, and who has kind of a thing for Chuck.  Just like Patty, this candy is a classic.\n\nIf you like chocolate and you like mint, theres no better candy.  The bright, fresh mint taste explodes at first bite, somewhat mellowed and balanced by the smooth chocolate covering: The chocolate really gets second billing here, although it becomes more noticeable in the aftertaste. Its incredibly sweet, but somehow doesnt overpower, and the urge for more can be difficult to quell.  Some nutritional information might help, but even that may not be enough.\n\nIn three \"Dark Chocolate Covered York Peppermint Patties (41 grams), there are 150 calories,  3g total fat, 2g saturated fat, no trans fat or cholesterol, 33g total carbohydrate , 27g sugar,  15g sodium, < 1g dietary fiber < 1g of protein, 2% of  RDA of protein, and 0% of the RDA of vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium. Not health food, but better than some other candies on the block. Of course, this assumes you eat ONLY THREE PEPPERMINT PATTIES. The ingredients also compare favorably with other candies: Sugar, corn syrup, semi-sweet chocolate (chocolate, sugar, cocoa, milk fat, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, PGPR, vanillin (artificial flavor), invert sugar, egg whites, oil of peppermint, milk.  PGPR stands for Polyglycerol polyricinoleate, an emulsifier made with glycerol and fatty acids.  At least theres no artificial flavors to go along with all that sugars, carbohydrates, and calories.  BY the way, the people at [...] have far worse (nutritionally) data for a York Peppermint Pattie, but one can't tell if their information (which is for one piece only) is for this exact same candy as listed here, or some other version.  You can call the Hershey Company in (of course) Hershey, Pennsylvania to pursue this further, 1-800-468-1714, or go to [...]\n\nLike Patty, Pattie is irresistible.

While not a rich banana flavor, it is recognizable, and none of the flavors seems off-tone-much more than can be said for similar products.  After looking at the ingredients below, I was very surprised that the banana power bar contains no cinnamon, and that the apple taste may be actually come from the grape and pear concentrates.  The ingredient list also reveals several grains (oat bran, rice bran, milled rice, brown rice flour), and the source of the banana flavor-banana powder.\n\nTexture: After the initial touch bite into the dense, somewhat hard surface, the ingredients gradually present themselves as very chewy with a noticeable grainy texture.  Again, while initiates may need time to get used to this, it is not unpleasant, and the chewy quality gives the impression of substance (although there are only 3 grams of dietary fiber, as seen below).  I left one semi-open for a day or so, and found that the bar was easier to bite into, perhaps due to moisture absorption.\n\nNutritional Information:\n\n(The information below is from the website, [...] and differs slightly from the Amazon.com list.)\n\n230 Calories, 10 Calories from Fat, Total Fat 2.5 mg (Saturated Fat, 0.5 g and Trans Fat, 0 g.), Cholesterol 0 mg; Sodium, 100 mg; Potassium, 190 mg; Total Carbohydrates 45 g (Dietary Fiber 3g, Sugars, 20g; Other Carbohydrates, 22 g); Protein, 9g\n\n*Percent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.\n\nVitamin A 0%*  Vitamin C 100% ,Calcium 30% , Iron 35% , Vitamin E 100% , Thiamin 100% , Riboflavin 100% , Niacin 100% , Vitamin B6 100% , Folate 100% ,Vitamin B12 100% , Biotin 100% , Pantothenic Acid 100% , Phosphorus 35% , Magnesium 35% , Zinc 35% ,Copper 35%,Chromium 20%, Chloride <2%\n\nIngredients:\n\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup With Grape And Pear Juice Concentrate, Oat Bran, Maltodextrin, Milk Protein Isolate, Banana Powder, Almond Butter, Rice Crisps (Milled Rice, Rice Bran), Brown Rice Flour, Glycerin, Natural Flavors, Soy Protein Isolate.

As others have indicated, this cereal is just way too sweet and artificial tasting, not too surprising when you look at the ingredients. Kids who have grown up on this taste might find it palatable, although the kids I know would go for chocolate flavoring first.  At least, the nutritional content isn't too bad.\n\nIf available and your budget permits it, try this novel idea: Get some regular mini-wheats and throw some strawberries on them.\n\nNutritional Information per 42 gram serving, does not include milk:\n\nCalories: 140\n\nTotal Fat 0.5 grams (g)\n\n0 grams of Saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium.\n\nTotal Carbohydrates 35 grams (12% of \"Daily Value,\" based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

First of all, sugar-free means it doesn't have sugar.  This is simple stuff, but important to remember.  Sugar Free Vanilla Syrup has a vanilla flavor (although pure vanilla extract will be purer and stronger), and the taste of an artificial sweetener.  If you don't like that taste, or you insist on vanilla extract, you'll obviously be disappointed.  However, within the limits of its ingredients (and remember, this is vanilla, not, say, hazelnut or peppermint, both of which I prefer in coffee), this is a very good flavor addition.  Also, please note that the apparently outrageous price is due to the inclusion of 4 bottles of the syrup, not just one.  Then, the price is quite reasonable.  Even in the Bay Area, I've found certain flavors difficult to find, and buying from Amazon.com beats a long search.  If this is not your cup of tea (oops...), I'd still encourage you to try other flavors or, if you can, try one that is not sugar free.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNewman's Own Organics Newman O's, (Original) Creme Filled Chocolate Cookies, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nIn this multi-level analysis of Newman-O's vs. Oreos, we consider three areas:  Taste, Values, and Nutrition (as always, consult a physician or other professional about nutritional concerns).\n\n1) Taste. A Draw--Newman-O's for adults/Oreos for kids:\nNutritional considerations aside, Kraft (which owns Nabisco) Oreos have the advantage of more sugar and a familiarity that does not bring contempt.  Newman's have a more \"mature\" taste, heavier on the cocoa side with hints of dark chocolate, and not as sweet as Oreos.  Newman-O's, however, are somewhat of an acquire d taste:  At first I didn't like them, then began to appreciate the more subtle cocoa flavors.  My hunch, though, is that kids will prefer Oreos.\n\n2) Values. Newman 1, Kraft 0 (maybe even -1):\nThreatened by a lawsuit and federal truth-in-labeling regulations, Kraft finally removed the trans fat (probably the worst kind of fat) from Oreos in 2006, even though a company spokesperson once said this would be \"difficult,\"  and that trans fat availability should be left to nutritionists, not to legislators or the courts. (Perhaps Oreos are \"red state\" cookies, and Newman's are for \"blue staters?\") Before legislation requiring labeling of any trans fat of half a gram or more, Kraft did not list it; Newman)'s never had it.\n\nNewman's, as always, donates all after-tax profits to charity; Kraft donates an unknown amount, because they don't publicize it, and because you can bet the CEO's stock options that they're not donating all of it. While I don't want to get too political here, Newman's uses a number of organic ingredients, and organic food proponents cite the resulting health and environmental benefits.\n\n3) Nutrition. Advantage, Newman-O's, but 2 cookies or 3?\nIt turns out that nutritional information for Oreos is based on a 34 gram,  three cookie serving size; Newman-O's uses a 28 gram, 2 cookie serving size.  As shown below, the 2 cookie serving size outclasses Oreos on having more of the good and less of the bad. One could argue, however, that this is an unfair comparison, because a serving size of Newman-0's is  % smaller than that for Oreos. (Although one could also argue that Newman's supports \"portion control.\" However, if your portion control isn't controlled and you have 3 Newman-O's, the nutritional edge decreases. Still, even 3 Newman's (compared to 3 Oreos) gives you 3.57% less total fat, and less sodium. However, you'll consume 11% more saturated fat, more carbohydrates (47.25 grams to 25 for 3 Oreos), more calories (195 to 160).  Some people may also prefer Newman-O's wheat-free ingredients and use of sweeteners, rather than the often maligned high-fructose corn syrup found in Kraft Oreos.\n\nThe Verdict. A great Paul Newman movie!  Oh, and if I have to choose, I'd say at least try the Newman-O's. You (the adult, but perhaps not your kids) may like the taste better than Oreos, and the 2 cookie serving size handily beats the 3 serving-size of Oreos on total and saturated fat, sugar, calories, and sodium (as well as containng more organic ingredients).  At three cookies each, the difference begin to disappear, though with Newman-O's you satisfy not your appetite for cookies, but your hunger for helping people in need. I know, it sounds touchy-feely, but it's true.\n\nIngredients--Kraft Regular Oreos:\nSUGAR, ENRICHED FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, REDUCED IRON, THIAMINE MONONITRATE [VITAMIN B1], RIBOFLAVIN [VITAMIN B2], FOLIC ACID), HIGH OLEIC CANOLA OIL AND/OR PALM OIL AND/OR CANOLA OIL, COCOA (PROCESSED WITH ALKALI), HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, BAKING SODA, CORNSTARCH, SALT, SOY LECITHIN (EMULSIFIER), VANILLIN-AN ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR, CHOCOLATE.\n\nOREOS, Nutritional Information.  3 cookies (34 grams):\nTotal fat (7 grams), Saturated fat (2 g).

This dark roast is full of flavor, never gets acrid, never tastes burnt--even when left in the pot too long!  It does not irritate your stomach or leave an aftertaste.  It is a very good roast, well worth the money.  In fact, you realize how much you get ripped off by the major, more popular brands out there once you taste this coffee.\n\nWhether you like a lighter cup or a strong cup, the coffee never disappoints.

You can make a strong pot of Deadman's Reach and not taste anything bitter.  But the caffeine level will surprise you.  It may say it's a dark roast, but it tastes like a rather plain medium roast.  In fact, I have had blonde roasts that are similar in taste to this coffee.  You are not getting a very flavorful cup of Joe here, but a pleasant smoothness that delivers a caffeinated punch.\n\nI view this blend as a utilitarian blend.  You need caffeine?  Buy it.  You need a gentler flavor?  Buy it.  Not fond of aromatic coffee?  Buy it.\n\nDeadman's Reach lacks the impressive flavor and aroma of Kicking Horse Coffee blends and lacks the heavier, bold caffeine grip of Valhalla Java from Deathwish.  It's still much better than Dunkin Donuts or most of Starbuck's coffees.  You can taste the quality.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nDeath Wish &amp; Valhalla Java Whole Bean Coffee Bundle Deal, USDA Certified Organic &amp; Fair Trade (1 of Each Bag)\nReview:\nTwo great coffees, perfect together.  These coffees are strong and never get acidic if brewed extra dark.  Valhalla Java tastes the best, has more nuance to it.  Death Wish is a sort of straight-forward dark deliciousness.  Nothing soft or sweet about these bad boys.  They make a tough cup of Joe that tastes good.  I will say that, if you make them too light, they lose a lot of their flavor, IMO.  Valhalla also seems to have a better caffeine punch in the face.\n\nBuy it.  Brew it.

No stomach issues or acid issues.  Even when it's been left in the pot too long, its drinkable!  I don't recommend old coffee, but that has to attest to this coffee's quality.  It never tastes burnt.\n\nHoodoo Jo is unique in that it has a strong medium flavor to me, yet it definitely has \"fruity\" undertones.  But nothing weird that gets in the way of that coffee taste we all crave.  It is not sweet, but pleasant.  Different.  Earthy and fruity is the best way I can describe it--even though fruity makes you think of sweetness.  I simply mean it has a natural flavor that attracts you like fruit does.  Very interesting.  Very tasty.\n\nIt will not turn off the hardcore dark lovers OR the light drinkers.

Faster than Gatorade.  You can feel the difference.  Especially if you are working hard, working out, or having a hard day out in the heat.\n\nKeep it cold and you will really enjoy its taste.

Each individually wrapped bar contains 200 calories, with only 60 calories from fat. There are 13 grams of sugar in each portion.  The bar has 5 grams of protein, so you wouldn't call it a \"protein bar\" (this designation seems to refer to something greater than 10 grams of protein).  The top three ingredients are brown rice syrup, cashews, and oats.  There's not much fiber (2 grams).\n\nSize-wise, this is not a large bar.  The weight is 49 grams (1.76 ounces), which makes it smaller than, say, a Clif bar.  It is easy to chew, and it doesn't fall apart as you are eating it (a real problem with some bars).

I don't look at them as \"power bars,\" but rather snacks that are agreeable, tasty, convenient, portable, and nutritious.\n\nPowerBar's Fruit Smoothie (\"Berry Blast\" flavor) is almost there, with a few big caveats.\n\nI shared my PowerBar with 4 others, teens and adults.  All found the flavor better than expected.  One noted that it had a \"fruity gum\" flavor.  I had a similar reaction; it wasn't unpleasant.  All gave it a thumbs up for flavor.\n\nThe consistency was soft in 80 degree heat, like soft taffy.  When placed on a plate, it stuck to the plate and you had to literally peel it off.  There was a sticky residue left on your fingers and on the inside of the packaging.  This didn't make it the cleanest snack.\n\nThere were the 24g of sugar in one serving.  I thought this made it too sweet.\n\nMy biggest complaint was the lack of dietary fiber in this \"fruit smoothie\" (less than 1 gram; PowerBar's Harvest Bars have 5g).  The illusion is a package of real fruit.  Well, real fruit is full of soluble and insoluble fibers, essential nutrients.  The fiber tossed out in the manufacturing process here probably ended up as livestock feed, which is ironic when you think about it.\n\nSo for the consumers who have the illusion that they are 'eating\" a real fruit smoothie,  this bar is, obviously, something else.  Just remember, the PowerBar Fruit Smoothie isn't going to replace a banana and a Clementine orange in your diet.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:  Two years later, with a much more strenuous workout regime (participated in Wasatch Back RAGNAR relay last month, 29 hours, 189 miles), the thing I like about this bar is that it is easy on the stomach as a recovery bar.  It's not a candy bar or, if you use it as one, it's an expensive piece.  I use it AFTER a run or strenuous workout (defined as a run of at least 5 miles, 8.5 minute miles or better, or a full hour of core workouts).  I like the tanginess.\n\n Just throw some in your gym bag.

Keep looking.\n\nHowever, if you want a well-packaged, carb-rich bar that won't melt in your hands, that will give you a sugar replacement that 15 minutes following your intense activity lasting 45-60 minutes, then this PowerBar Performance Energy Bar might work for you.\n\nNonfat chocolate milk might work just as well, but it certainly won't last 12 months in that pack under your bike seat or in your backpack's side pocket.\n\nKnow what you are getting, and use it appropriately.

They are well-packaged, but how do you control your eating?  Well, the bag folds over nicely and, when closed with a clip, the chips stay fresh.  So you can't use the excuse, \"I needed to eat them before they went stale.\"  And the pepper keeps you from just gobbling them all down.

Baked Nutrition Bar, Dark Cherry, 1.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI've tried a number of \"nutrition bars\" over the years.  There are certain characteristics that make them acceptable and desirable:\n\n1.  Taste - they have to taste halfway decent.  I realize these bars in general aren't supposed to be candy bars, but in the heat of competition or need, a bit of taste isn't bad.\n\n2.  Calories - one of the reasons for having a bar is to supplement your diet.  For example, I ran 10 miles this morning, costing me about 1000 calories.  Most bars are in the 200-300 calorie range.\n\n3.  Fat - I'd like the calories from fat to be less than 30%.\n\n4.  Ingredients - when push comes to shove, organic, whole grains, and few additives is my goal.\n\n5.  Fiber - at least 6 grams of fiber per serving helps the world go round.\n\n6.  High fructose corn syrup - avoid, avoid, avoid.\n\n7.  Consistency - they shouldn't fall apart as you are eating them.\n\nSo this particular bar, Eat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar (Dark Cherry) has a nice taste (and cherries in the ingredients!), is 200 calories with 60 calories from fat, has 6 grams of fiber, is a bit crumbly (don't eat it on a treadmill), and is mostly whole wheat, corn, and oats (nice).  It's not vegan.  There is no HFCS (yay).\n\nI like the dark cherry taste.

So why buy them?  Well, you have to be committed to the Wild Planet philosophy of sustainability.  I suspect that means little or no by-catch.  However, since the overall populations of sardines in the Pacific are abundant, I'm not certain whether these sardines are more \"sustainable\" than the other brands.  But...

I'm giving this item 2 stars because the flavor was fine; though one child said it tasted \"like vitamins\", I think he meant the good fruit-tasting vitamins. The problem with this bar is the texture -- it is VERY gummy, and even stretched a bit when we cut it into portions. As one chews, it becomes rubbery; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one-third portion because it was so unpleasant. If you're prepared for the texture you may enjoy the fine flavor, but otherwise I'd suggest you steer clear of this energy bar.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nArchway Cookies, Original Coconut Macaroons, 10 Ounce Box\nReview:\nIt's smart for Archway NOT to call these chocolate chip cookies. By that measure they would fail. But to call them cookie thins or crisps or chips or whatever gives the buyer a good idea of what to expect.\n\nThese are very thin and very crisp and they do taste of (but not exactly like) chocolate chip cookies with a bit of a toffee taste. Still, chocolate chip cookies come in a variety of types and styles, and this would fit in just as well.\n\nIf these were in a chocolate chip cookie contest they would lose. But if you know what to xpect I think you might like them. They are gluten-free, and the top few ingredients are: gluten free flour made with rice flour and potato starch, brown sugar, butter, chocolate chips, whole eggs, sugar, salt, baking powder and vanilla. Wow, that's pretty straightforward. Each cookie is about 20 calories and 1 gram of fat and they do scratch that gotta-have-some-cookies itch, even if they're not particularly sweet or chocolatey. Each serving of seven cookies has 115 mg salt and 6 gm of fat, 3.5 of which is saturated fat.\n\nPackage recommends dipping these in creme or crumbling and serving on ice cream. (The latter is a good option if yours come the way mine did -- almost completely pulverized in shipping.)

It tastes great when used for cooking, and is not as unhealthy as you might imagine because it has a complex structure that makes its fat less accessible. aplus, it tastes really good, alone, used as an oil or an ingredient. You can substitute other oils in a recipe for coconut oil and it lends a delicious new flavor. A bit in cocoa, for instance, is scrumptious!\n\nAlternatively, cocnut oil is a multi-use beauty product. It works as a moisturizer, body lotion or hair conditioner. It also has healing properties!\n\nThese packets are great to travel with, but they are larger than a single-use, so if you carry it around bring a container for it.

The chocolate pretzels were also melted, but after I saw the condition of the truffles I put all of the boxes into the refrigerator which helped set them back up.\n\nThe rest of the items were in good condition,...they tasted alright, but all of the items except for the Almond Roca  were  very generic and seemed like dollar store items.  However I give the seller 5 stars for contacting me , that was unexpected and I do appreciate it.\n\n*Original review below:\n\nIn all fairness the packaging is sort of pretty. Thats about it, there is next to nothing included in the tiny boxes. At least they could have used a bit more effort when it came to how much goes inside.

It comes in a rather thick brick divided into 16 squares. These are large candy bars, the nutrition information says it's about 3 servings, a child or small person would probably be happy with 4 squares (1/4 of the bar). Personally, I eat the whole thing, If I bought these by the dozen, I would not be small.\n\nTHe chocolate itself is wonderful, smooth and creamy. It has about 30% cocoa content. If you prefer dark chocolate, Ritter Sport's dark chocolate candy is wonderful too.\n\nLast week, we ran out of chocolate chips and wanted cookies, so we all coughed up our squirreled away ritter sport bars and broke them into bits. THose cookies were the best we've ever had.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S Chocolate Snack Mix, 6 Ounce (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nThese are tube shaped snack bags full of bite sized Hershey bar clumps.

Chocmeister Hazelnut Spread, Milk Chocolatey, 13 Ounce Jar\nReview:\nThis has a nice dark chocolate flavor which, unfortunately, drowns out the hazelnut flavor. It tastes a little dry, like there's not enough oil in it - and I don't care for greasy or oil foods. While I prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate - if I eat hazelnut spread then I want to taste hazelnuts, so I'm going to stick with leading brand for now.\n\nClaims:\n* While it has \"25% less sugar\" than the leading brand - it still has the SAME CALORIES!

They are chocolate-ly and not overly sweet. They manage to be both chewy and crunchy in just the right amounts. The coffee taste is very light and blends well with the other ingredients.\n\nThese little bars are only 130 each, provide 6 grams of protein and are made with whole grains and oatmeal. I eat these every day as an afternoon snack. Around 2 or 3, I'm craving a candy bar but I eat one of these instead and I'm ok until dinner. Saves me about 150 calories a day. The only criticism that I have for these bars is that there are not enough almonds in them. They are so good though that I still have to give them 5 stars.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGhirardelli Chocolate Caramel Turtle Brownie Mix, 18.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese brownies are soft, moist and delicious. They are so much better than other brands I've tried. Mmmmm!! If the ingredient list used whole wheat flour and something that wasn't \"partially hydrogenated\", I would've given them 5 stars. (Hodgson Mill brownies are also awesome)\n\nThese brownies are delicious, rich and chocolately. Enjoy them in moderation. :-)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nMighty Leaf Green Tea, Tropical, 15 Pouches (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nAlthough I love this tea, I don't buy it often because it is expensive for what you get. Amazon definitely has the best price on this tea that I've found. However, I will review the tea and not the price.\n\nThe tea bags are each good for about 8oz of water, add any more water and the tea will taste weak. The tea bags are large enough to give the tea plenty of space and the tea leaves are large and not crushed. The tropical flavor is really strong. If you like sweet tea but want to cut the sugar down or out, this is an excellent tea to drink. It tastes sweet without any sweetener. The tropical flavors compliment the green tea and the outcome is delicious.\n\nIf you are having a hard time cost-justifying this treat, go buy a tea in a coffee shop. It will likely cost you at least a dollar for one cup. If you buy this tea on amazon, you get a cup of tea for about fifty cents.

That was pretty convenient, and it actually worked as advertised!  It wasn't even too hot to carry!\n\nOK, what about the food?\n\nTo start with I'm just a regular guy who usually makes my lunches of the previous night's family dinner left-overs...i.e., not a gourmet, but not taste-dead either...\n\nI was pleased to find that the pasta cooked well, but be advised that if you don't shake the pasta down before you cook it you might find a piece here and there that still has hard spots in it.  There was plenty of sauce...no skimping on sauce volume, and the portion size was great for lunchtime.  I wasn't stuffed when I was done, but I wasn't still hungry either.\n\nThe meat sauce was tangy and mildly spicy.  The meat sauce contained small chunks of beef (i.e., looked like hamburger), and you could tell what it was if you looked closely.  The pasta and sauce consistency was good, and I enjoyed the entire meal.  Be advised that the sauce contains onion and garlic.  If you know you have an important meeting or date later on, you will probably want to pack some mints.  Say, that would be a great addition...an after-meal mint included with each meal that you can use to fight post-meal garlic breath.\n\nIf you like the combination of convenience and pasta, this may well an excellent choice for you.\n\nIf you are also environmentally conscious, though, you should probably think twice about this unit.  Once you are done with your meal there's really not much you can do with the packaging...just recycle it.  If, however, the packaging included a solid lid rather than just the strainer lid, the main container could be washed and then reused as a food storage container...alas, that is not the case.\n\nAnyway, I thought the food was flavorful, the portion was adequate, and the convenience excellent.  Environmental challenges drop the rating by a star though.\n\nLastly, you'll have to determine whether the per unit cost makes this a good deal for you.\n\n4 stars\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Once I figured out the right amount to put in the waffle iron, they cooked efficiently in my Belgian waffle maker.\n\nThey were really sweet -- and every bite had the taste of chocolate chip. I would have preferred something a bit more subtle, and with the sweet taste, I found very little need for butter or syrup as I would normally top my waffles with. Perhaps this was also related to the amount of oil I used (in terms of being rich) as I also found the waffles a bit greasy -- and not light and fluffy. I'd suggest halving the suggested amount of oil for a less greasy and slightly healthier waffle. Pancakes are similarly easy to make on a griddle or frying pan with this mix, but you won't need any oil.\n\nIf you love chocolate chips and want an organic mix for breakfast, you've found your product. The price is reasonable for an organic product. But if you want something more subtly sweet, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNutri-Grain Kellogg's Soft Baked Chocolate, Raspberry, 10.4 oz\nReview:\nIf you like chocolate bars as *part* of your breakfast, this is your bar. If you like raspberry, this isn't your bar. The raspberry taste is nearly nothing to me and there's not much filling inside. They are very thin and soft, however, so easy to bite down whenever you are hungry.\n\nWhile loaded with some added nutrients, there's still 12g of sugar per bar and plenty of artificial ingredients. At 4g fat per bar (and you'll likely want a couple to fill you up), it's an okay snack, but it is not a meal replacement or protein bar. It's more like a cookie or dessert, but there are better alternatives out there. Because they are so small, you'll if you're using them as a meal or large snack, you'll likely want something else.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nOrganic Valley, Organic Milk Boxes, 1% Plain Lowfat Milk, 6.75 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nIts milk - but its ultra-high temperature (UHT) processed that you don't need to keep cold until opened. The milk I received had a best by date about five months out, so it has a pretty good shelf life. Elsewhere in the world, UHT is the most popular type of milk and is the cheapest variety available.\n\nIt tasted pretty much the same as other 1% organic milk Ive consumed, but there is a slight taste difference with UHT  perhaps a tad sweeter, but otherwise I don't know how to explain it. The milk cartons are in a convenient 6.75oz size for an easy 90 calorie drink with only 10g sugar, but they are terribly expensive at over a buck a carton. Theyre well made with a convenient straw, but Im not sure I can justify such a price for something that is much cheaper in the regular refrigerated version.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nLindt LINDOR Dark Chocolate Truffles, Kosher, 60 Count Box, 25.4 Ounce\nReview:\nDark chocolate is extremely popular and the large bite size Lindor Lindt Dark Chocolate Truffles fit smoothly into that desirable dessert category.  First, the dark chocolate is smooth as the package states, the chocolate is very meltable and easy to chew, unlike some hard dark chocolates, and the individually wrapped pieces are perfect for a small treat. Nice to put out after a dinner party as well.\n\nThe ingredients are pure, though the fat is a bit high, and if you don't want so many calories, eating just one piece keeps the calorie count under 100.  Since it's such a delightful taste, just one can be savored and enjoyed without the need to open more. It's a nice gift since you can give a whole package or just individual pieces which are each wrapped separately. Except for the fat, the nutrition facts aren't that bad, so you don't feel so guilty indulging. Any how, there is no \"healthy chocolate\" and I enjoy eating these as an occasional pleasure.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Chocolate, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nFirst immediate impression: really sweet and artificial tasting. Though it kind of tastes like fruit punch in my opinion, it's kind of a shocking type of taste for a product like this. Definitely a bit like candy as reviewers have mentioned.\n\nApart for the energy, it did keep me going for a game of basketball I had about an hour after eating the bar. Nutrition facts aren't that great compared to completing products, however. And like other products from this manufacturer, they're still quite expensive per single bar.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nEat. Think. Smile. Chewy Granola Bars, Rich Cocoa, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nFrom the moment you cut open the package, the cocoa smell wafts out, and you know you're in for a treat.  The Eat. Think. Smile. rich cocoa granola bar is delicious and healthy, a sometimes rare combination. It's easy to understand the ingredients and is easy to nibble on for a great quick breakfast or snack.\n\nThe special African cocoa has antioxidants, according to the package, and is comparable to a cup of green tea, one of my favorite accompaniments.  The box and web site explain the details about how healthful cocoa is, and why its CocoaOne is so special and exactly where it comes from.  Each main ingredient in these bars, whole grain oats, rice, cocoa, and nuts, stands out nicely.  There is a lot of competition for granola bars, but this one is low in sugar and fat, though it isn't high in fiber, it does contain some, 3 grams per bar.\n\nThere is crunch when you bite in, though an occasional piece may be a bit hard, you know you've got something substantive.  It's not sticky like some bars and doesn't crumble which makes it easy to eat on the go.  It comes in other flavors, which I have actually tried, and I'm impressed with the choices.  I'm think the name is too long and it would be better with just one word, instead of trying to be clever with  fanciful sayings. However, the product is tasty and hopefully, good for you. It's nice to see a company promoting a product for healthy living.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKellogg's Raisin Bran Cereals, Cinnamon and Almond, 14.5-Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nSo many cereals and so few mornings to enjoy them!  I remember the time when I would choose between Cheerios or corn flakes, now my pantry probably has 15 different cereals including oatmeal; however I have always been a raisin bran fan and often could trick myself into thinking I was eating something healthy (bran). 18 grams of sugar is not a small amount and with the addition of cinnamon added to the coated sweetened raisins the pandering to children's taste buds is ridiculous.  I admit I like the addition of almonds, but I believe this has been done before?  Using my box of puffed rice (naturally sweet) as a sort of base comparison, I was astonished to contrast it with the Raisin bran ingredients.  Puffed rice has no added sugar but is sweet enough, while the raisin bran has sugar, brown sugar, dextrose, cinnamon and honey.  (The last 4 items are under 2% but who needs them.)\n\nCould I become addicted to this cereal, probably yes.  But even after the first taste test (A full bowl of just raisin bran Cinnamon Almond) I knew I would have to mix it with something else (Shredded wheat for example) to bring down the sugar count and the calories (240 with milk).  My general advice is don't give up on basic raisin bran but stay away from the expanded raisin brans.  This new product will not revive the cereal industry, but push us more toward generic healthier cereals.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nNescafe Coffee, Partners Blend, 3.52 Ounce\nReview:\nInstant coffee has come a long way from the early days days of Sanka, and this newest product from Nescafe shows how much the product has improved with a decent coffee taste. The Fair Trade marking is even impressive.\n\nThe taste of the 100% arabica coffee is enjoyable and satisfies my early morning coffee needs. I may not be a true coffee aficionado since I mix my beverage with cream and sugar, but I drink a cup of coffee everyday. I've always enjoyed a quick and easy Nescafe packet like these when traveling through Europe. All one has to do is pour the contents of the tube into a mug, add nearly boiling water and voil - Instant coffee. If you're going to make coffee for more than a couple people, this isn't cost effective, but if you can live with the taste, the individually wrapped paper tubes leave far less scrap than the pods. There are also no grounds to throw away or clog drainage systems.\n\nFor the frugal amongst you, the price of a box of 50 packets is much more competitive than the Starbucks VIA instant -- this Nescafe product is about 75% less per single serving. If the taste was perfect ( la regular coffee), I might be able to award five stars, nonetheless, you can still tell it's instant, so four stars it is. Nonetheless, I'm still happy with the Partners' Blend and it's definitely a step above Sanka...\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWheat Thins, Fiber Select, 5 Grain, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nAt first the new Wheat Thins, Fiber Selects, seemed rather dry and almost like a piece of cardboard.  However, as I kept on chewing the flavor was good, not too powerful for a mild or strong flavored cheese.  The size is also good, small bites that are easy to eat.  The total fat is acceptable, but other crackers such as Triscuits, are lower in fat.  The important part is that it's basically healthy fat and the number of crackers is generous per serving.\n\nSome of the crackers were broken in the box I received, which is frustrating when you want things to look nice.  However, that can happen with any box of crackers.  I don't know if I would buy them again because the price of crackers if getting expensive.  When they are on sale, I'll probably pick up a box.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWholesome Sweeteners, Organic Sweet and Lite Sugar and Stevia Blend, 1.25 Pound\nReview:\nThe organic sweet and lite sugar and stevia blend is definitely a worthwhile product if you want to cut the calories and still have a sweet tasting end result.  Being organic is a plus and having to use less of the product is great as well. The conversion chart shows that half of this combo replaces the same amount of real sugar.  I found, however, that I can even use less than the recommended amount in the recipes and still get a nice sweet taste. Using only stevia isn't as good, as I think, the taste of stevia alone is a bit artificial or overly sweet. I think the price is mainly what makes me lower the review a star (to four stars.)\n\nThe texture of the this sweetener is also good as it sprinkles nicely on top of baked goods giving them a crispy look.  It's easy to pour and measure, doesn't clump, and keeps fresh in the plastic bag.  Also included with the product are recipes on the back of the bag and on the web site. This is good for those who need guidance with measurements and also good because it gives some new treats to make.  I feel it's a great product for baking, cooking and beverages and will help to cut the calories and sugar in food, perhaps helping those who might consume too much sugar.  The cost per pound is significantly more than sugar, but worth it if you are trying to cut out sugar from your diet and keeping in mind less of the product is generally needed than sugar.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['product', 'sugar', 'taste', 'like', 'coffee', 'sweet', 'chocolate', 'good', 'something', 'also']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nNespresso Milano - Limited Intense Edition 2015 (10 count)\nReview:\nExcellent roast, if you like it lighter not too strong and flowery.

A very large bowl was filled with just the small amount of corn put up to the \"fill line\" in the popper.

This popcorn pops up beautifully, with virtually no waste.  Typically there are two or three, maybe four unpopped kernals that fly out into the bowel at the beginning of the popping process, but about the same number that are left in the popper when everything has stopped popping - in other words, virtually no waste.\n\nAnd while I don't like plain popcorn, this is ALMOST good enough to eat without anything on it.  But I'll stick to good old fashioned butter and salt.  Regardless, this popcorn is about the best we've ever tasted, and is the only brand we intend to purchase in the future.

It's not unpleasant, though not quite consistent with the grape and peach flavor that is supposed to be dominant.  Looking at the label, it's likely the pear juice that's blended in.\n\nThough I won't have any problem drinking the full case that we purchased, it is probably not a flavor combination I'd personally want to try again - I like a slightly \"stronger\" taste, and this is a bit subtle to me.  It may well be just what someone else wants, however.

She's made them from scratch, used various mixes (some not so good, some great), but this is about as close to what \"real\" brownies tasted like in my pre-gluten free days.  And if Amazon is out of them, there are other sources at reasonable prices (Wal-Mart in many locations, for example).  I still prefer Amazon, of course - no tax, no shipping if over $25, etc.  There is not much more to say - these are GREAT!  Just as with many gluten free items, they don't stay as moist as \"regular\" (gluten-containing) brownies, so they won't last quite as long.  But it'll likely be difficult not to finish them all in a couple of days anyway, so that hasn't been a problem.\n\nNote: we won't give 5 stars unless we consider a product at the top of the \"best\" list.  This is more than just a very good product.  Gluten free?  You'll love these!  Family of gluten free relatives?  You'll hardly be able to tell the difference if at all.  Just enjoy.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRawseed Organic Apple Cider Vinegar 3 Pack 16 Oz Glass Bottles with the Mother,Kosher\nReview:\nThis was originally a strong 4-star review, but after using almost all of the first bottle, I'm very displeased with the actual bottle itself - enough to downgrade the overall product, even though the content of the bottles is great.  Specifically, the tops of the bottles (not the caps) are very thick and rounded, and it is literally impossible to pour out just a small amount without making a considerable mess and also having the product run down the side of the bottle significantly.  I've ended up having to tear off a partial sheet of paper towels each time I use this to keep it from running all down the side of the bottle and even dribbling onto the counter top.  Other bottles have a far less rounded top lip, allowing the amount of liquid you want to be poured out, and the flow to fairly abruptly stop when you tip the bottle back up again.  That doesn't happen with this bottle design.  I don't know that I've ever dealt with a bottle of liquid that was this messy and difficult to pour small amounts before (and that covers a whole lot of decades, hah hah!).  If you don't mind messy, or having to clean up every time you pour a little out, then forget this top paragraph and go with the rest of the review - the contents still rates a very strong 4-star review.  I just find it so messy that I will likely not purchase this product again, but go back to Braggs.\n\n==== Original Review Follows ====\n\nBraggs has been our \"standard\" for years.  I decided to try this for a variety of reasons, and am not disappointed.  It does not seem to be quite as strong as Braggs, but at the same time it seems more mild/less acid, beyond just seeming a bit less strong.  It most definitely has mother in it, and could very well become an equal favorite with Braggs.  For now, I don't feel inclined to elevate it QUITE to the 5-star level, but you will certainly not be disappointed in this product.\n\nAlso, the expiration date is October 2021 (purchased in January 2017) - over 4 years of shelf life left.  Definitely not old product!\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['product', 'free', 'gluten', 'one', 'like', 'taste', 'good', 'great', 'years', 'amazon']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nThe Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf Jasmine Dragon Phoenix Pearl Green Tea, Whole Leaf Loose Tea, 4-Ounce\nReview:\nThe is my first time with a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf product. I am, however a great fan of Chai tea and had unfortunately discovered that all Chai's are not created equally but I like to give them all a whirl.\n\nI was surprised at how much tea is actually packed into this little 5oz tin. I have bought loose teas before that only filled half the box so I was pleased that they did not skimp on the servings here. The tea is loose and very fragrant. My main concerns were the anise. I am not a big fan of the taste of licorice and that is usually the primary reason I will dislike a chai tea - I hate it when the taste of licorice overwhelms the flavor as it means there is not enough cinnamon and clove in it.\n\nThankfully that is not the case here I thought there was a very near perfect balance amongst the spices in this tea. However, as mentioned by previous reviewers this can brew up fairly weak. One way to overcome this and get it to steep a little stronger is to take the time to grind up the tea before use.\n\nAs I bought this through Amazon, I also received 3 full tins which I thought was a pretty good deal for $16.00. I will be trying other products from this company for sure.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I normally don't like hard, packaged cookies, but these weren't half bad.  I was actually sorry to see the bag run out!\n\nThese were crunchy without being stale.  As one of the other reviewers said, they have a lot in common with vanilla wafers.  While I didn't try this, I suspect they'd be excellent as part of a cheesecake crumb crust -- and they're whole grain (and gluten free, if that's important to you), unlike the vanilla wafers you buy at the store.  Plus, if you end up with broken pieces, they'll still work in a crumb crust!\n\nThe vanilla taste was great.  These are sweet without being too sweet, they're pretty low in sodium, and they're fairly low in fat (nutrition facts are currently in one of the product images).  I have had the chocolate chip ones before but I like these a lot better.  Although they'd certainly work for recipes, they also make a decent snack on their own.  And the whole grain flour makes them better for you than other packaged cookies would be.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHomefree Treats You Can Trust Gluten Free Mini Cookies, Double Chocolate Chip, 5-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI am always thrilled to discover new whole grain products.  If they happen to be gluten-free, that's fine by me, although I do not have any special dietary requirements other than being vegetarian.  Honestly, it's probably best to eat a variety of different grains instead of sticking with the same one(s) all the time, anyway.\n\nThese are made with oat flour (from GF oats).  They're free from all common allergens except for soy, and they're also vegan.  If you have more than one allergy, it can be a bit hard to find any packaged foods that are OK for you to consume.  These, however, would be good even for multi-allergen households.\n\n7 cookies (a little bigger than the size of a quarter in diameter, and about 1/4 inch thick) make up one serving (150 calories).  Less than half the calories from these are from fat, which is nice, and the sodium is relatively low for a packaged food.  The fiber value is a bit low for a whole grain product, though.\n\nI'll admit these are not my favorites, as packaged cookies go.  But, I've never really liked hard or crispy cookies, so perhaps I am not the best judge of that.  Taste-wise, I would not have guessed these were GF or vegan if I hadn't had the package right in front of me (I regularly eat wheat, dairy, and eggs, so I am constantly reminded of what \"the real thing\" tastes like).  I did like the taste.\n\nPersonally, I would probably not buy these again simply because they're hard cookies (which, as explained above, is not my own preference).  However, because they did taste good, they did include whole grains, and because they cater to a variety of specific dietary needs, I'm still giving a fairly high rating.  It's hard to get all of those things together in one product.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBaker's Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate Squares, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nPlease note: this review is for the unsweetened baking chocolate squares, since multiple product listings are mixed together on this page.\n\nI like to bake and I make pretty much everything from scratch.  (No boxed mixes for me.)  Whenever I come across a recipe that calls for unsweetened chocolate, this is what I use.  It's pretty much guaranteed to work (or at least, it always has for me) and, being the easiest-to-find product of its type, it's likely what the recipe was developed with.  I actually have a difficult time finding any other brands of unsweetened chocolate locally.\n\nI have used lots of this in cakes, cookies, brownies, etc. -- all with success.  Another way I like to use it is in homemade yogurt.  I much prefer the flavor of unsweetened chocolate in homemade yogurt (just take about 2 ounces, chop it up, and let it melt in around a quart of scalded milk; let the milk cool and add yogurt starter, then put in a yogurt maker).\n\nPlease note: Baker's changed the packaging some time ago (I first started noticing around the holiday season last winter), cutting the amount of chocolate you get in half (i.e., the boxes are 4 oz. instead of 8 oz.).  So even though the newer packages contain less product, if you are wanting fresh chocolate, you'd be better off ordering the 4 oz. boxes (I've seen a lot of listings for the 8 oz. boxes on Amazon).  And you may want to check with any 3rd party sellers before purchase to clarify which you'll be getting.\n\nI'm not happy that Baker's makes it seem on the box like the new containers are improved because of the \"easy break\" bar.  (I preferred the individually-wrapped squares to the bar.)  However, this is still my go-to product for quality and availability reasons.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nMandy's Cookie Thins, Dark Chocolate, 4.6 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis review is actually for the chocolate flavor which is listed as \"currently unavailable\" but I really hope it comes back in stock soon because I like these a lot.  I am normally not a fan of packaged cookies but I got these in a subscription box and I figured I would give them a try.  And they are oddly satisfying.\n\nThe chocolate flavor is just at the perfect level.  These have a texture that is rather unlike other packaged cookie -- crunching and chewing them is somewhat reminiscent of a Ritz cracker, but not exactly.  They appear to be fairly stable in transit; I did not have any broken pieces in mind.  You can just about fit one whole cookie in your mouth without breaking it in half (though perhaps it looks a little rude to do so).\n\nYou can see the full ingredients list if you zoom in on the product image.  These contain wheat, milk, and soy ingredients and are processed in a facility that processes eggs and tree nuts, so watch out if you have any of those allergies.\n\nI'm not really going to bother with any kind of nutritional analysis.  These are cookies and are marketed as sweets so yes, they are somewhat high in sugar and lacking in protein and fiber, but they never made any claims to be health food.  Consume in moderation, maybe not every day, and you'll be fine.\n\nThese are crisp but not too hard or dense.  I think they would make excellent dunking cookies for some coffee, cocoa, or milk.  They are vegetarian (but not vegan, for reasons described above).  I am happy to have discovered this company and am interested in trying some of their other products now!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDoctor Kracker Organic Crispbread, Seeded Spelt, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI like these, but they're not for everyone.  They're quite a bit thicker than regular crackers so they are a little difficult to break and/or bite into.  On the other hand, because of that, they can stand up to heavier spreads and toppings without breaking, and they're much less likely to be damaged during shipping.\n\nThe taste is mostly neutral although, due to the presence of sesame seeds, these are going to be better in combination with savory toppings.  I tried (separately) Monterey Jack cheese and natural peanut butter, and both of those worked.  Sodium levels are intermediate, I'd say, but these are not overly salty.  You can see the full ingredients list and Nutrition Facts panel if you look at the product images.\n\nThese are fairly high in fiber, healthy fats (from the seeds and oils), and protein, plus they have a little iron.  They're whole grain, vegan, non-GMO, and organic, if any of those are important to you.  Spelt is a variety of wheat, though, so these are not gluten free.  The spelt flour and seeds, together, give these a \"rustic\" feel, so if you're looking for something softer or more refined, this is probably not what you want.  Since I've been eating whole grains pretty much exclusively for several years now, though, these are a texture I'm used to.  They're not greasy and don't leave oils on your fingers, but they are a little messy.  When you break or bite into them, seeds tend to fall off, so you should definitely eat them over a plate.\n\nI've been using these as part of the lunches I bring to work and I think they're great for that, since they're fairly healthful and since they're easily portable.  I can't rave about the taste (I really don't want to eat them on their own, without a topping), but they're about what I expected.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCrunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers, Sea Salt, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese are a little hard compared to wheat crackers, but for a gluten free product, the texture is not bad.  These are pretty thin and they taste really salty.  So it is amazing to me that one serving only has 135 mg of sodium.  That's much lower than I expected based on taste (which is a good thing).\n\nI like how a lot of the grains in these are whole grains (i.e., brown rice flour, whole grain yellow corn) instead of just simple starches.  In my experience, starchy (and non-whole-grain) GF products are easier to come by than versions with some whole grains.  These are fairly low in fat and have a little fiber and protein.  You can see the full ingredients list and nutrition facts panel in the product images.\n\nBecause these are pretty salty, you would want to use savory spreads or dips if you are going that direction.  (And don't use anything that will conflict with the flavor of sesame seeds, because that is definitely noticeable here.)  Cheese and hummus would both be good.  These are also vegetarian.  And they don't stick in or on your teeth after eating, unlike some other crackers I've had lately!\n\nOverall, I love the flavor and the texture is something I can live with.  Even though I don't need to eat GF, I would seriously consider buying these again.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Almonds, Low Sodium Lightly Salted, 6 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI normally buy the Whole Foods store brand almonds to eat as a snack at work, and I probably still will after trying these.  These (I'm reviewing the \"lightly salted\" kind, since this page covers multiple products) are OK but nothing really special for me.\n\nThey do have a little bit of a lower salt level than the almonds I'm used to, and that is a definite benefit, especially if you are watching your sodium intake.  Despite the \"lightly salted\" label, you CAN still taste the salt.  Which is good, because I think I would have a hard time eating plain almonds without salt.  So the low sodium is definitely a benefit.\n\nHowever, the almonds, themselves, are really quite small, as almonds go.  And despite the fact that my usual almonds -- like these -- are also roasted in oil, these are a bit oilier and have a larger proportion of calories from fat than my usual almonds.\n\nIn the end, the health benefits of nuts are well-established -- protein, fiber, healthy fats, vitamin E, iron, etc.  If you have a Whole Foods near you, you should give their roasted and salted almonds a try (they're often on sale).  But if you don't have access to Whole Foods or a similar store, or if you are watching your sodium intake, these Blue Diamond lightly salted almonds might work for you.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nEmmy's Organics, Coconut Cookies - Lemon Ginger, 2 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI've had the lemon-flavored maracoons from Emmy's before and liked them, so I was excited to get a chance to try the dark cacao ones. (I've been having a bad weekend and I needed a chocolate fix.  These definitely helped.)\n\nI would not have guessed these were raw although I'm not surprised they're vegan -- they definitely have a dark cacao flavor (no milk chocolate here).  They're also kosher and non-GMO, if those are of concern to you.\n\nThese do have almond flour and are made in a facility that processes peanuts, in case you are worried about allergens. They have more fiber than you might expect from a cookie (2g), which is nice.\n\nThe only thing I'd warn you to watch out for is that one single cookie is a serving and has 100 calories, so if you eat a whole 3-pack, you're getting 300 calories.  (It's very easy to eat a whole 3-pack, trust me.)  Also, the packages are not easily resealable so you may have to worry about that if you're going to try to limit yourself to one serving.\n\nOverall, though, I think these taste very good, plus they're full of healthy fats and antioxidants (from the cacao powder).  If you're going to eat cookies, these wouldn't be bad ones to choose!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEmmy's Organics, Coconut Cookies - Lemon Ginger, 2 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese were pretty good.  I got them in a subscription box (I forget which one) and didn't know they were vegan and gluten free (and raw and kosher and non-GMO) until after I ate them.  They were very soft despite sitting around my condo (unopened) for a few weeks, and I loved the flavor.  The levels of lemon and coconut worked well together (the coconut was detectable but not overpowering).\n\nThese do contain tree nut ingredients (almond flour) so you would want to watch out for that.  Also, wow, I ate three of these, which is apparently three servings, for a total of 300 calories!  So you would probably want to limit yourself to one or two or these could totally ruin a diet...Guess that's to be expected of cookies, though.\n\nAnyway, if you are making a purchase decision purely based on taste (and you like lemon and coconut), these are wonderful.  If you're counting calories, stick to having one at a time, though.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Flour Garbanzo Bean, 16-ounces (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI went on a flour-buying binge from Bob's Red Mill a year or so back.  I have had repeated successes with some of the flours (oat, coconut, whole wheat pastry, almond meal) but others were sitting around waiting for me to figure out an appropriate use (green pea, chickpea).\n\nI honestly cannot tell you what possessed me to buy 88 ounces of chickpea flour.  But I decided a couple of weeks ago that I'd paid for it, so I'd better use it.  I've since gone seeking recipes on the internet (won't bother to post them here since you can find the same ones using your favorite search engine; gluten-free cooking sites especially have a lot of offerings).  I've been quite pleased with the results.\n\nI have used this flour for:\n\n*crackers\n*pancakes\n*falafel-type patties\n\nThis is a very easy flour to work with.  It doesn't clump easily and I can make things like cracker dough without resorting to the food processor.  (Not that I don't love my Cuisinart, it's just easier clean up if I don't have to drag it out.)  The pancakes did not taste at all beany.  You could actually use just about any pancake recipe and substitute an equal amount of chickpea flour for all-purpose flour, and it should work.\n\nThe recipe for falafel patties was on my bag.  (If it's not on yours -- I think they do occasionally change up the recipes printed there -- there are a lot of recipes for Bob's products on the Bob's Red Mill website, as well.)  Anyway, the recipe is great because it works, even for inexperienced cooks.  It's easier than using actual mashed up chickpeas to make falafel, because you don't have to add additional flour or egg to make the patties stick together (so good for vegans).\n\nI've done a little experimenting with making deep-frying batters using chickpea flour, too, and that worked fairly well.  It's been awhile since I did that, though, as I'm trying not to do too much deep frying these days.\n\nAlso, this appears to last a long time, stored at room temperature.  Like I said, I bought mine at least a year ago, and it's still good.\n\nNote: You can make hummus with this flour, too.  I, personally, do not care for hummus made from chickpea flour.

I use 1/2 bag per recipe of my Peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.  The mini chips are perfect.  One trick - -  when using these in a cake or cookie recipe, stir them into your flour before adding to the wet ingredients.  This is an old baker's trick to keep them from falling to the bottom and staying there.\nThese are the \"music\" to my allergen free life and baking.  Even eaten out of hand, like when I am too lazy to bake, they are YUMMY!\n\nBTW:\nGluten free peanut butter choc chip cookies\nAdapted from Ruth's Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookies\nBy HokiesLady\n[...]\n\n1 C. oil (corn, peanut, olive, etc.)\n1 C. Peanut butter  (Skippy Natural's Creamy-gluten/dairy/soy free)\n2 eggs\n1 C. sugar\n1 C.

This makes the PB easier to remove after measuring.  ~ I use Skippy Naturals Creamy (Brown cap here on AMZ)  (Another trick:  One cup from the Skippy's Natural 15 oz jar is to about the bottom of the first stroke line of the red \"K\" in Skippy's Natural label on the jar.  About 1/2 of the jar.  It may be a bit short, but it works.)\n\nPut two eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat slightly.  Then add the oil and PB mix.  Mix a bit.\nAdd:\n1C. sugar\n1 C. Lt Brown sugar\nMix well, then\n\nIn a 3-4 C. measuring cup add 3 C. of your favorite GF flour mix.\nAdd 1/2 tsp EACH of baking powder and salt\n1 tsp baking soda\n1/2 bag of Enjoy Life mini or regular choc chips\nStir the all together - I use a table knife to get to the bottom without shooting flour all over everything, just kind of cut into the flour mix with it.\n\nScoop portions onto a greased or ungreased nonstick cookie sheet.  Bake 375 degrees for 12 mins.  They may not look done, but remove from oven and let set on cookie sheet to cool, then remove to plate or rack.  I get about 3 dozen palm-sized cookies.\nNOTE: If you are using a stand mixer to mix this all up, you may need to add 1/4 C. of liquid, such as coconut or almond milk.)\n\nAdapted from Ruth's Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookies\nBy HokiesLady\n[...]\n\nI find that the use of oil makes for a shortbread-like cookie.\n\nI hope you and your family find these as enjoyable and easy to make  as I do.\nPlease feel free to comment if you need more information.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLa Tourangelle Pan Asian Stir Fry Oil, 16.9-Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nUse this for ALMOST EVERYTHING now -  -douse it on chicken before roasting, hamburgers, pork steak and, of course, the base for my stir fries\nIt is WONDERFUL!!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLa Tourangelle Pan Asian Stir Fry Oil, 16.9-Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThis is SO good!

I will chalk it up to, perhaps, a measuring error or an ingredient sub or something affecting the flavor and when I order my next shipment, as I will,  hope that they have gotten these back to their normally YUMMY self.\n\n10/1016:\nCame back to order some more - - again for making crumbs and snacking on cookies but - -\nNOT at this Price & OUTRAGEOUS Shipping COST.

I just ordered a case of this on S&S after paying $3.69 per carton in the stores - - when I can find it.  (It is about $2.12 per carton here on S&S.)  The Tetra packs make storage so much easier.  When chilled, it is hard to tell the difference between this and 2% milk.  Even my very discerning daughter likes this.  One caveat, be sure you are not getting the Unsweetened as, to my mind, the taste is not quite as yummy as the just-plain Original.

The artificial vanilla flavor was NOT impressive.  It simply does not taste much like vanilla.  The added \"vanilla\" just provides some off-beat chemical flavor.  Even worse, is that this chemical flavor lingers on the metal coffee filter, and contaminates the flavor of any coffee that is subsequently brewed.\n\nAnother overall problem with Starbucks coffee is that, in an attempt to imitate Peet's coffee, the Starbucks company provides a generous roasting of their coffee, but they over-roast their coffee to the point that the overwhelming flavor is one of charred or burned wood.\n\nThus, for my 5-cup a day habit, I stick to Folger's, and when I want to treat myself, I buy Peets.  I am not sure why the Starbucks company is so successful, but I am sure it has MORE TO DO with their nice furniture, the creative nomenclature of their coffees, various other marketing gimmicks, and the endless selection of sugared, candied, confectioned, and embellished coffees, and LESS TO DO with the quality of the coffee itself.\n\nAs a graduate student at U.C. Berkeley, I lived directly across the street from the first Peet's coffee shop, located at Walnut Square in Berkeley, California.  I first went to Peet's in the year 1973.\nRating:\n1.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

And you can buy this and many other cereals in single-serving envelopes that you then cook in your own utensils.\n\nSo why go with these?\n\nBecause they're so incredibly easy.  And because something that's easy gets done more often than something that's not.\n\nI used to buy these with delight in my local grocery store -- always had them on hand.  More mornings than not, I'd have one of these, either before leaving for work or once I got there.  It would always hold me until lunch or later, without any impulse to snack in the morning.  Maybe a couple of times a week, I'd have another one for a snack in the afternoon or evening, just because it was so easy -- almost as easy as the pint of ice cream I'd have rather had but which would have been much less good for me (and even easier than EasyMac!).\n\nThen I couldn't find them at any local grocery store for years.  So I'd occasionally buy a new box of the instant envelopes, having thrown out the old box before ever finishing it.  There they sat, unwanted and forlorn, until they too got tossed.\n\nThese aren't the best diet food or health food, and they certainly aren't ecologically wise.  But they work.  They're easy enough that they'll substitute for even less good choices (such as a take-out breakfast sandwich -- erghhhh).  And they're satisfying -- you really feel you've had something when you finish scraping out the last of the bowl just as it is (no need to add anything).\n\nI even looked for them occasionally on Amazon but could never find them.  Imagine my surprise when I googled them tonight in a sudden mad urge to go farther if necessary to stock up on them again, only to discover Amazon has them after all!

Our local independent grocer carries them during the holidays, and we just finished the last of the ones we've been hoarding since last December.  These have a very soft, pleasant taste that grows on you.  One of these shortly before bedtime makes me feel calm, relaxed and quite self-indulgent, although they're actually more nutritious than you might think.  A very desirable item to stock in the pantry for last-minute entertaining, or to bring along when visiting a sick friend or a shut-in.  They're actually good for settling a shaky stomach (must be the ginger and/or cinnamon?!), which may be one reason Delta gives them out as in-flight snacks.  They're fabulous with a dish of ice cream or fresh fruit, or with port,  brandy, cream sherry or a liqueur after dinner.  They work well as an item for elegant receptions.  We like to offer them at dinner parties along with coffee and dessert.  Unlike many cookies, they go as well with morning, afternoon or evening tea as with coffee, and of course they're marvelous on their own.  I just ordered 2 packs of 5 and will be ordering more before those are gone.  Hooray!  If you haven't tried them yet, maybe you'd like to: I bet you'll love them as much as we do!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBiscoff Cookies, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 5)\nReview:\nOh, I'm so glad to have found these on Amazon!

My husband actually prefers them cold and drinks them for breakfast, lunch, dinner or late-night snack with total delight.  Great to grab when running off without time to eat, or when planning to be away.  Ideal for travel or emergency stash, because no refrigeration required, not even a microwave for reheating if you're like my husband and enjoy them cold!  We have 2 cases a month on Subscribe-and-Save and go through them pretty fast.  Their nutritional profile isn't as bad as you might think (at least according to Weight Watchers), and they're very satisfying.  If you're craving a late-night snack, think:  would you be better off with cookies/candy/chips or with tomato soup??  I love that these are just as convenient as those usual snack culprits!!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPacific Foods Organic Vegetable Broth, 8-Ounce Cartons, 24-Pack\nReview:\nWe, too, are using more and more veggie broth and bouillon these days, so, when several reviewers commented it was nice to have the 8-oz size to drink right out of the box, we thought, hey, portion-control, great idea!  Not really so great, as it turns out.  We probably WILL use the remainder as reviewers also suggested to flavor rices, couscous etc. where you don't need a whole quart and the smaller size is convenient.  But the taste, on its own, just isn't too pleasant.  My husband and I tried them  separately on the same day.  I was surprised how awful mine tasted but resolved not to say anything in case he liked his.  When he got home, I asked how was the wonderful new broth, and he said \"AWFUL!\".  So that was that.\n\nIncidentally, if you are looking for two absolutely great-tasting vegetable broths (both of which my husband will drink up all by himself, right from the box, all 32-oz.!), try these:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wolfgang-Puck-All-Natural-Vegetable-Cooking-Stock-32-Ounce-Packages-Pack-of-12/dp/B0029TJRE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wolfgang Puck All Natural Vegetable Cooking Stock, 32-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>&nbsp;-- fabulous for drinking and cooking -- use in place of beef or chicken broth, too (and just available again on subscribe-and-save).\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pacific-Natural-Foods-Mushroom-32-Ounce-Pack-of-12/dp/B001HTE08G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pacific Natural Foods Mushroom, 32-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>&nbsp;-- extraordinary -- the broth par excellence for mushroom soup, but great for absolutely anything -- world class (though currently out of stock -- should be available again soon).\n\nHope this helps.

Also great for nibbling!!  8 tiny cookies are only 180 calories, and one or two suffice for a fine decoration for dessert.  I see a few negative reviews, but my experience is highly positive:  light, delicately crunchy, a deft coating of dark chocolate over an ethereally thin cookie wafer.  And beautifully packaged:  the plastic box liner cradles 8 each in 4 cushioned nests, so that they're unbroken (even though I dropped a box).  Highly recommended!!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nScarpetta Tuscan Vodka Sauce, 19.8-Ounce Jar (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nOh, this is SO good!  Super easy (just heat in its own jar with loosened top in the microwave -- takes less time than to cook the pasta and doesn't even dirty a pan or dish!).  Love it with tortellini or any type of plain pasta.  Also great with sliced green olives added to it.  Don't believe the number of servings they say, though -- if you're anything like my husband, you'll barely get through one meal for the two of you per jar, with maybe enough left for him to take to work the next day.  We'd clearly need 2 jars if we have guests -- and it's definitely company-worthy, in addition to being a fast-after-work meal for ourselves.  My husband wasn't enthused about buying this but is definitely a convert.  We've gone through 3 of the 4 jars in 2 weeks.  You'll LOVE it!\n\nP.S.  The packaging problem reported earlier is DEFINITELY SOLVED -- you might even be able to run over the shipping box in a jeep without damaging the jars inside.  Well done, Scarpetta and Amazon!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nIdahoan Mashed Potatoes, Loaded Baked Potato, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese Idahoan \"instant\" mashed potatoes are a godsend.  Quick:  name some other food that can be ready in less than 5 minutes and is \"real\", even though cooked from a mix?  These are real, dehydrated potatoes, and they're unbelievably fast to prepare.  Just put 2 cups of tap water into a microwaveable bowl, add the contents of one of these bags, stir a little to mix and to get rid of the biggest lumps, and microwave for 3 1/2 minutes.  That's it.  When finished, just stir and enjoy.\n\nDon't think fast means yucky.  They taste delicious, and you can fool people into thinking they're leftover homemade or leftovers from a restaurant.

I tried this Loaded version because the Four Cheese were temporarily unavailable from Amazon itself, and a third party supplier was overcharging by about 400%.  The Loaded are pretty good -- not quite as good as the Four Cheese, but still great to have in the pantry.\n\nWhen you come home late from work, confront the fridge with exhaustion, and think longingly of your favorite ethnic hangout or even take-out, to combat that urge you need resources at hand!  We keep thin ham steaks in the freezer and turkey kielbasa in the fridge for just such occasions, both of which are fully-cooked and just require searing/heating in just minutes.  These wonderful mashed potatoes can be ready even before those are and will complement any entree.  Add a fresh steamed vegetable and/or simple salad (or even, if you're really wiped out, high-quality canned or frozen vegetables -- try keeping a can of cut green beans, drained, in the fridge marinating with some fresh chopped onion and a wonderful vinaigrette as an instant salad for just such emergencies!), and you can have a meal on the table faster than you can get back home with takeout.  Better for the budget, better for the waistline, and yet still delicious comfort food!!!  :)\n\nFYI:  Although I wouldn't try it with the Loaded, you can serve the Four Cheese or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Idahoan-Mashed-Potatoes-Buttery-Homestyle-4-Ounce-Package-Pack-of-12/dp/B000KOUK6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Idahoan Mashed Potatoes, Buttery Homestyle, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 12)</a>&nbsp;for a dinner party, even -- they're that good!\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['even', 'good', 'one', 'amazon', 'sauce', 'nbsp', 'great', 'love', 'fresh', 'make']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nJack Link's Beef Stick, Original, 36-Count Bag (Pack of 2) 33.5oz\nReview:\nThese were great, Something that I might keep around year around, however I would of like just a little more spice, My Dog however really enjoys them, a super treat for him\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

They're very crispy with a decent amount of dark chocolate, not too \"killer\" for dieters (Weight Watchers points value for 1 bar: 4 pts; for 2 bars: 7 pts).\n\nThey not very big, and don't offer a lot of protein or fiber, but they ARE tasty, slightly sweet, slightly salty, crunchy.  I didn't detect much almond flavor; I tasted more peanuts than anything.\n\nBasically, I like these OK, but given a choice, I'd probably opt for something with more fiber than these, and more filling.  These are just too much like \"candy\" for my taste.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S GOLDEN ALMOND Chocolate Bar, Roasted Almonds in Fine Milk Chocolate Candy Bar, Individually Wrapped Bars in Gift Box, 14 Ounce Box\nReview:\nI'm an unrepentant chocoholic, and I'm usually an equal-opportunity chocoholic, meaning I'll eat just about anything that isn't pure drek.  Hershey's is a decent brand, with generally good products, not as good as some brands, but probably better than others.  So I kind of knew what to expect with these almond chocolate bars.\n\nYou get 5 large-ish milk chocolate bars with just the right amount of crunchy almonds.

Yes, the quality is consistent with Hershey's brand -- creamy, a bit sweet (it is, after all, milk chocolate), etc.  The gift box is nice.  But at the current price (twenty-five dollars) it's just not very economical, especially when you check out other options.  If this were Scharffen Berger or Guittard quality, it might be worth the extra cost.  But for Hershey's?  You be the judge.  Only you know if it's worth it to you.  I'll pass.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nStella D'Oro Cookies, Almond Delight, 9 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI've purchased a few Stella D'oro varieties over the years but haven't been a steady customer, so I really don't have much to compare these to as far as taste/quality over a period of time.\n\nI do know that I like these.  Probably not enough to put them on subscribe and save, but enough to purchase again occasionally.\n\nFirst things first: these are not overly sweet and they're rather dry, so it's clear they're intended to be eaten with coffee or tea or even wine.  The flavor is there -- vanilla in some, lemon in others, chocolate -- but it's very subtle.  The icing and sprinkles really bring nothing to the party -- the icing is a thin \"smear,\" without flavor.  But flavor and \"mouth feel\" are overall pleasant.  They're also quite \"sturdy\" -- mine survived transport in less than optimum exterior packaging without a single broken cookie.  Seriously -- not a one broke.  Even with that, they're still tender - not \"hard\" and crunchy at all.  And you do get quite a lot of them -- they come in a plastic tray that is 9.5\" x 5.5\" x 2\" that is filled full.\n\nAs I said, I'll likely order these sometime in the future, possibly adding them into my \"cookie rotation\" of brands/types that I like to purchase occasionally.  Definitely worth 4 stars: I like them.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nOliveNation Honey Roasted Sesame Chips, 8 Ounce\nReview:\nLike others, I'm sure, I first tasted these in a \"pub mix\" blend of pretzel stix, cheese twists, and rice treats.  It was love at first taste, and I spent some time trying to find a source for just these sesame chips.  Tried a couple of other options, but this is the clear winner!  It comes closest to the taste of the sesame treats in the pub mix -- a little salty, a little sweet, and a tender \"crunch\" that is ... well ... just about perfect.\n\nI eat them \"straight up,\" of course, but one of my favorite ways to use them is in my own savory trail mix:  these crackers, mini pretzels, cheeze crackers (or goldfish crackers), honey roasted almonds, and corn chex cereal.  I usually have a couple of bowls of this out for cocktail parties and it always goes over well.\n\nWill continue to purchase these as long as they're still available.  These OliveNation chips have the best flavor and definitely are the freshest tasting.

Well, there went the diet, big time. The milk chocolate is creamy goodness, and the toffee chips and finely chopped almonds add just the right amount of sweet slightly salty crunch. These are absolutely addictive, and I have to seriously limit my consumption if I have any hope of staying on track diet-wise. Will definitely keep these around -- despite the temptation.

Peppermint bark, filled peppermint chocolates, chocolate mint cookies, anything that combines mint with chocolate.\n\nThis year, we got both the dark and milk chocolate varieties of these Ghirardelli peppermint bark squares. We liked both flavors, probably preferred the dark chocolate, but found both to have a nice balance of mint to chocolate. The crushed peppermint candy bits in the white chocolate top add a nice crunch, too.\n\nThe price here is very good, too.

What's not to like?  These make a nice snack in the afternoon with a cup of tea.  They're more like a cookie than a candy bar (to me, anyway).\n\nAmazon's price is pretty good, too, for 36 \"regular sized\" packages (2 cookie bars per package).  Will order again, for sure.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSNICKERS Easter Minis Size Chocolate Candy Bars 11.5-Ounce Bag (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI have a love/hate relationship with this candy.  I love it in terms of the flavor, size, etc.  But it's all too easy for me to overindulge.  So I have to be careful and put myself on an \"allowance.\"  But it's so worth it!  I'm careful to indulge in a treat occasionally, not as a habit, and this is my \"go to\" treat (well, this, or a small brownie hot fudge sundae) :-)\n\nSeriously, though, these are excellent, and just the right size for a small treat once in awhile.

My favorite recipe is a quinoa salad using dried apricots, golden raisins, slivered almonds, and a little green onion, with a lime-mirin-oil-spices dressing.  YUM!  The 12 packs will last awhile, too.  Very happy with this purchase.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSpecial K Cracker Chips, Sea Salt, 3.48 Ounce ,(Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThese are pretty good.  They're not as crispy as potato chips, but they have a decent sour cream and onion taste.  Like someone else mentioned, these are VERY similar to Popchips, just a bit thinner.\n\nThe calorie count is low: 27 chips = 110 calories, and there are only about 3 servings per box, so even if you can't stop yourself, you're looking at only 330 calories or so for the entire box.  Obviously, you wouldn't want to down an entire box every day, but if you do, the damage isn't *too* bad.\n\nI'll probably purchase them once in awhile as an alternative snack.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['flavor', 'like', 'good', 'chocolate', 'really', 'one', 'use', 'amazon', 'definitely', 'sweet']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nLazy Day Foods Dark Chocolate Ginger Cookies, 4.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThese cookies arrived in the afternoon. They didn't sit in the mail box long, but I discovered upon opening them that the chocolate was seriously melted. I put the box in the refrigerator. Not the best idea obviously because now the cookies were cemented together by the chocolate. Obviously this is no fault of the cookie manufacturer, but I do want to make you aware of what you might be dealing with if you mail order these.\n\nI'm a hormonal woman, so I found a way to eat the cookies, though they were so messy I ended up eating over the sink and creating a huge chocolate mess on my hands and face--I looked like a three year old.\n\nWere they worth the trouble? Sadly no. Ginger? What ginger? The dark chocolate isn't bad, but the cookie tastes like nothing. I was really looking forward to eating a ginger cookie, but there wasn't even a hint of it.\n\nIf you're on a gluten-free diet, you might find these tasty.

These were the first I had eaten in some years as I prefer liquid center cordials.  The chocolate is very good, the cherry firm, the center a tasty mixture of liquid and creme fondant and the texture pleasing,  but they are very sweet.  I decided to buy a box of dark chocolate cordials to see if, perhaps, they would be less sweet.  As expected, they are less sweet than the milk chocolate variety but still very sweet.  These are not the cordials which most people would enjoy snacking on, one piece is enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.

Instead, it is almost a thick soup. It is good as is but was better when I drained a can of beans and made a quick succotash. It would make a good starter for a variety of other dishes including gumbo. Well seasoned out of the can, I like a little more salt and spice so added a little Tony's All Purpose Creole Seasoning. Delicious. It was good enough that I am going to try other products from this company.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSweetGourmet Mello Cream Autumn Mix - Candy Corn Mix (1.5Lb)\nReview:\nMost of the critical reviews concern sellers and shipping.

My wife and I agree that they are good but not as good as expected.  Neither of us could detect any separate taste of ginger so I broke off a piece of cookie without filling. A very easy thing to do.  The piece had a faint aroma of ginger but little taste of it.  It was easy to break off a piece of cookie without filling because the filling in each cookie is scant.  The pictures on the outside of the package are not pictures of the cookies in the package.  This doesn't affect taste but is an extremely irritating form of chiseling behavior.  Because of this and the lack of ginger flavor, I'm rating these cookies at two stars.  If you want lemon cookies there are both better and less expensive options.  Try Mississippi Cheese Straw Factory lemon straws.  No filling, but superior lemon treats.  Much better than Carr's.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nTandoor Chef Palak Paneer, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nIf there is a better brand of frozen Indian food, I have yet to find it.

Therefore I do not recommend it as a diet or health product.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nKashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis might be an excellent cereal, but the boxes that I bought had large pieces stuck together that were hard as a rock and dangerous to the fillings in your teeth.  They can be manually broken apart, but that is a lot of extra trouble.  Other than that, the flavor is good.  It does have a significant amount of fiber, and a reasonable amount of protein.

The problem has been noted by other reviewers.  The manufacturer has lowered his costs by loading them with potato starch which adds nothing except calories.  If I want potato chips, I will buy potato chips.  There are 140 calories per ounce, with only 1 gram of protein and 1 gram of fiber.

The ingredients are whole grain oats, honey, canola oil, raisins, oat bran, molasses, ground flax seed, vanilla extract, and spices (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves).  A 2 ounce serving (based on 6 servings in the 12 ounce bag, is rated as 5 grams of protein, and 4 grams of fiber with 230 total calories.

The featured product, which this review applies to, is Kashi Creamy Truly Vanilla.  Other products, such as the Kashi Honey and Cinnamon, have different flavors and different availability.  Reviews for other products are meaningless and should be ignored.  In actual fact, the local Krogers only has the Honey and Cinnamon in their hot cereal selections (they have a vast array of Kashi cold cereals).  This Creamy Truly Vanilla is a basic cereal that you can dress up with other ingredients to your own taste.  I personally add cinnamon, nutmeg, and local fresh honey, along with dried fruit&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Good-Sense-Berry-Medley-5-Ounce-Bags-Pack-of-6/dp/B002SZWFTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Good Sense Berry Medley, 5 Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;The prepared product can be eaten without milk because it already has a creamy texture - that is an advantage over dry cereals as some people do not drink milk - it is also helpful when you forgot to buy milk at the grocery store.  Overall, this is an excellent cereal, particularly because you can add ingredients to your own taste.  Some reviewers have recommended almond butter and/or bananas, although I have not personally tried those combinations.  I would note that the Amazon price is good, and is comparable to what local grocery stores charge for comparable cereals.  They only down side is that you have to buy six boxes at a time.  I would note that I remember somewhat larger portions when I first started using Kashi cereal.  You can double the portion size by using two packets, but be aware that you need a larger bowl for the microwave to keep it from boiling over the sides.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['good', 'one', 'flavor', 'grams', 'cookie', 'nbsp', 'ounce', 'product', 'teaspoon', 'sugar']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nEden Organic Mexican Rice &amp; Beans, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI found this to be extremely bland .

I have purchased and enjoyed more Cheese and Broccoli Rice Sides than I can even count. This particular Rice Side will not be going on my \"favorites\" list though.\n\nWhen I grabbed this, only a small picture was available so I failed to see the word \"ham.\" I have been a vegetarian for twenty-seven years ... and if I am going to \"fall off the wagon,\" it will be for lobster (not for a bit of ham flavor in a Rice Sides). Therefore, those whose religious or personal convictions do not permit the consumption of ham will want to take note. (The good news is that this new, huge picture should solve the problem).\n\nSince it was unusable by me, I relied on my family to provide feedback (yes, I am totally cool with them eating meat). The report was that it was \"tasteless\" and \"bland.\" My boyfriend tried some fresh cracked pepper and shaved parmesan on his (it's our go-to solution for everything). He finished the little mound, but did not return for seconds. And, my brother simply left his on his plate.\n\nSome of these sides are great, some not great.

This apple cider tastes good as a standalone powder in hot microwaved water andor as a mix with tea (I have used this mix with some Celestial brand tea flavors). There are even cider recipes listed with one of the boxes I have opened within this pack (recipes for mulled spiced cider, apple pie shake, and warm caramel apple drink. I also like that I could just microwave plain old tap water for just one minute and 30 seconds, throw a pack of the apple cider mix in the water and I have a delicious apple cider drink either as a standalone andor mixed with any of the store bought tea mixes that my husband and I have.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nV8 +Energy, Juice Drink with Green Tea, Peach Mango, 8 oz. Can (4 packs of 6, Total of 24)\nReview:\nThis V8 Energy Pomegranate Blueberry steady energy from green tea is ok. The pomegranate and blueberry blend fruity flavor at least makes it somewhat drinkable. However, the aftertaste was a bit too much for me and I noticed after I already bought it that I should have checked to see if regular sugar or a different type of sweetener is added when I noticed that the different taste might have come from the Sucralose added in to it. I understand that other people reading this may be completely ok with Sucralose andor other types of sucralose substitutes. However, I admit to preferring drinks with either regular amounts of regular sugar,low amounts of regular sugar or simply adding some water if a high amount of regular sugar is added.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nRoyal Dansk Danish Cookie Selection, No Preservatives or Coloring Added, 12 Ounce\nReview:\nI admit that my food weakness for cookies and chips are what influenced me to buy and try this 12 ounce tin of Royal Dansk Danish Butter Cookies from my job.

Tub (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nThis 15.5 ounce container of Campbells Slow Kettle Style Sweet Tomato Bisque (Tomato & Sweet Basil Mix)is scrumptious and cooks pretty quickly. Additionally, this soup has the right amount of sweetness with a robust tomato flavor. Im grateful that the place of my overnight job carries this because nights like tonight I do not feel like cooking and would much prefer having something that can be ready in less than 10 minutes when having more time to myself to relax before leaving for work. This Campbells Slow Kettle Style Sweet Tomato Bisque fits the bill because it is ready around 2 minutes via a microwave.  Im guessing that this Campbells Slow Kettle Style Sweet Tomato Bisque can be a standalone meal with pairing it with just bread and better. However, for me I admit to having this soup with Bar S Classic Corn Dogs dipped in honey batter (which my husband was able to have some corndogs ready for me within just 3 minutes) which paired perfectly with this  Campbells Slow Kettle Style Sweet Tomato Bisque (Tomato & Sweet Basil mix)tomato soup.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBear Creek Cheddar Broccoli Soup Mix, 11.2 oz\nReview:\nThis 11.2 ounce bag of Bear Creek Cheddar Broccoli Soup Mix at a Big Lots store inside a mall near the area where my husband and I currently reside (the Big Lots looks like a cousin of the Dollar Tree store but with the addition of more home furnishings). Anyhow, this Bear Creek Cheddar Broccoli Soup Mix is very easy to cook because you just add 8 cups of water, stir for ten minutes via the user friendly instructions on the back of the soup package and voila its eventually done. The additions of fresh or frozen broccoli as well as a meat (such as chicken) obviously enhance the soup even more.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRed Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit Mix, 45.44 Ounce\nReview:\nThis Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit Mix, 44.45 Ounce from Red Lobster is appetizing and extremely easy to bake even if you are a novice cook. I admit that I decided to give this a try after being persuaded by my husband to do so. We use to go to Red Lobster quite a bit back around 2009-2010 when we were living in Orlando Florida and he enjoyed the cheddar biscuits from there (we were familiar with the Red Lobster restaurant that was just a few miles from the University of Central Florida).  Anyhow, this box nearly duplicates the Red Lobster cheddar biscuits at home and are very easy to make with 14-16 minutes even if you are a beginner cook.  I admit that I cannot make these too often due to my weight loss goals but they are worth it to make for at least an occasional treat.  Im definitely not writing this to show off but also as a future reference point for my husband and myself for food companies to invest in (stock market wise).\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['also', 'taste', 'ounce', 'mix', 'tea', 'husband', 'water', 'im', 'like', 'job']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nAnnie's Deluxe Creamy Whole Wheat Shells &amp; Extra Cheese Cheddar Sauce Macaroni &amp; Cheese, 12 Boxes, 9.5oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI bought this at Whole Foods when my daughter was sick and was requesting nothing more than mac and cheese. I figured at least this would give her 6 grams of fiber and 11 grams of protein per serving (box serves 3). Sometimes I use 1/2 the cheese sauce so it's not too overwhelming and salty, she never knows the difference. She woofs this down and asks for more. I have been hoping Annie's would introduce a ready-made mac and cheese in whole wheat for a while now, and finally it's here.

Though I really like the design of their pyramid bags, and really like the Earl Gray flavor; there is something very off with the flavor from this tea.  It's like a very strange combination.  The Bergamot flavor is missing from this, no question.  You can't even smell it when you open the package.  The ingredients mention some type of marigold flowers which do not mix well with the Earl Gray.

Yes it does have \"natural flavors\" not found in regular orange juice that make me wonder just what that means, but that plus filtered water and concentrated orange juice make up this drink.\n\nNo fat, no cholesterol.  Sugar is 28g, though the label doesn't indicate any is added so hopefully that's all natural from the oranges.  What gets me about this Tropicana Orange Juice is consistency between cases.  I got one case that tasted perfect, but the very next case was thick and off.  It even had 3 months on the expiration date so that wasn't the issue.  I see from other review's I'm not the only one with this problem, so it's something to consider if you go with this brand.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSwiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix, Sensible Sweets, Light, 8 count,0.29 ounce, (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI have enjoyed Swiss Miss for years because it's easy to make with just hot water. It's easy to make, just add hot water and stir; you can substitute milk for water if you have it available, but that's what makes this product so versatile.

You will have to remove the lid entirely to peal off the internal 'safety seal'.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nArm &amp; Hammer Baking Soda Fridge Freezer Package, 16-Ounce\nReview:\nThe Arm & Hammer Fridge/Freezer Package is a great idea and one tough product.  This product has removable sides that reveal a cloth-like face.  This allows air to go in one side, become freshened, and exit either side.  This pack is great for use in freezers, which I mainly use it for, to help cut down on the freezer burn smell that can collect on bags and containers.\n\nWhen thirty days are up, you can pop open the top and use the baking soda for various cleaning purposes, although it wouldn't be useful for cooking purposes.  I have even refilled the package with fresh baking soda from a bigger container and sealed the top back and gotten the same results as if I had used a new fridge/freezer package.  This is a great idea and can really help if you have freezer burn odor or a fridge that doesn't smell fresh.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDove Milk Chocolate, Silky Smooth Promises, 9.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nDove's silky smooth milk chocolate promises are really delicious and pack a great message.

The outer packaging is holiday themed, however it's at such a great price you could stock up for school parties or other functions throughout the year.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMaruchan Instant Lunch Roast Beef Flavor, 2.25 Oz, Pack of 12\nReview:\nComparing these to a local mass market retailer per each, this is a really good price + free shipping.  Currently less than $0.50/each can't get them cheaper elsewhere.  These spicy noodles are great, gives more of a kick compared to the regular chicken flavor.  Personally I think they are just spicy enough without needing to constantly \"cool off\" your mouth after each bite.\nThese are INSANELY full of sodium; however most Maruchan noodle soups are high in sodium.  Some are upwards of 50% of your allowable daily value so this isn't surprising.\n\nThe nutritional values from the package are:\n\nCalories -- 290\nCalories from Fat -- 108\n% Daily Value*\nTotal Fat -- 12.0g\nSaturated Fat -- 6.0g\nTrans Fat -- 0.0g\nCholesterol -- 3mg\nSodium -- 1190mg\nTotal Carbohydrates -- 38.0g\nDietary Fiber -- 2.0g\nSugars -- 1.0g\n\nEasy ways to reduce the sodium is to shake off some of the seasoning prior to adding the water or don't drink all of the broth.  Overall, this is a convenient lunch, easily made with hot water and really delicious.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMaruchan Instant Lunch Roast Beef Flavor, 2.25 Oz, Pack of 12\nReview:\nGood price and a excellent deal. Currently less than $0.45/each you can't get them for much cheaper elsewhere. This 35% less sodium instant lunch noodles help address a big concern of most people, large amounts of sodium for just one meal. Some instant lunch noodles can be upwards of 50% of your allowable daily value so this is a pleasant surprise to find that Maruchan has taken this into consideration and tried to address it. The taste is a bit off; sorta like a buttery flavor and kind of begs for a bit more seasoning. The container has a good amount of veggies and seasoning, however it's still enjoyable even with the different taste. Something you could grow to love, knowing that is has lower sodium and in the respect is better for you.\n\nThe nutritional values from the package are:\n\nCalories -- 290\nCalories from Fat -- 110\n% Daily Value*\nTotal Fat -- 12.0g\nSaturated Fat -- 6.0g\nTrans Fat -- 0.0g\nCholesterol -- 3mg\nSodium -- 700mg (The regular flavor has over 1000mg)\nTotal Carbohydrates -- 36.0g\nDietary Fiber -- 2.0g\nSugars -- 2.0g\n\nOverall, this is a convenient lunch, easily made with hot water and is also rather filling.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['product', 'great', 'water', 'taste', 'nbsp', 'sodium', 'price', 'really', 'flavor', 'salt']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nMilka Triolade Chocolate Large ( 300g )\nReview:\nWhen I was growing up there was a delicious candy bar called Triple Decker, which featured layers of dark, white and milk chocolate.

If you're hankering for a Snicker candy bar, these might not satisfy you. However, if you want a crunchy, nutty, dark chocolate treat that makes you feel good after eating, you may want to try these.  They are low in sugar--only 6 gms--about the same as in a cup of Cheerios or Total.  The nutritionist said to think of sugar as poison--your body wants to eliminate sugar before fat, so stay low in sugar. I keep one of these bars in my purse when I'm out doing errands in case I get hungry.  I love the dark chocolate chips and nutty crunch. One bar at 130 calories is quite satisfying and is a great go-to treat when you want a little sweetness in your day.\n\nOne bar is only 3 points on Weight Watcher's point system. I took a box to my Weight Watcher's meeting to recommend them for a healthy snack.  I've lost 30 pounds and reversed diabetes in the past 2 years eating healthy foods: low-sugar, low-fat natural vegetable/fruits/protein/dairy diet with little to no artificially flavored and processed foods.  These bars are my treat when I'm desiring a little fun without the guilt. I haven't found a chocolate dessert treat that's lower in calories/sugar and healthier. If you eat a bar a day, this is a great price on Amazon if you are on automatic monthly delivery and beats my local supermarket price.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

There's an oval piece of meatloaf-like meat on top of gravy with some potatoes floating around in it.\nI bought two boxes of these, as I have been unable to stand in one place a long time to cook. One  I had from the next box could be eaten with a fork, had more potatoes and tasted okay.  Hopefully, the first box was a bad batch.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nWolf Chili with Beans, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nIt isn't greasy tasting, it's thick and damn good. I was vert surprised it held up to the gtreat reviews.  I added a few dried onions to it while cooking for ten minutes, the slight crisy and sweetness of the onion makes it taste as good as a restaurants.\n\nUPDATE...A week later I ate another serving, only I ate the whole can instead of only ten ounces....8 hours later my body was forced to regurgetate it. This has not happened to me since I ate some really greasy spicy chicken wings for lunch at work in 1993. I spit it into a paper towel, it was orange grease, I fear the same orange grease that rises to the top of most other canned chili's that I am able to mostly skim-off  This chili showed very little solid grease at the top, I could not quickly remove it, so I didn't. I suspect it had just as much but was emulsified into the thicker sauce, which I ended up eating and then regurgitating because my body could not digest it. I wish I hadn't eaten it. Now I have 22 cans more which I will be afraid to eat unless I can figure out how to easily get rid of some of the hidden grease.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStash Tea Chamomile Nights Herbal Tea 20 Count Tea Bags in Foil (Pack of 6) (Packaging May Vary) Individual Herbal Tea Bags for Use in Teapots Mugs or Cups, Brew Hot Tea or Iced Tea\nReview:\nWonderful, not overpowering...I boil water, put in 48 oz. sealable container to steep with 7 bags and seal cause I read if steam escapes so does the valuable components.

If I pressed down on that, who knows how much packed chicken is there, didn't care at that point...knew I wasn't getting anywhere near an actual can of chicken like the other white meat organic type I have bought.  That brand has a full can of chicken with water added to top it off.  If you tip the can, drain the liquid the can is still almost full.\nThe taste is like any other canned chicken, but when you buy those maybe you get what you pay for.\nw/this brand half the money you are spending on it is paying for the added greasy chicken broth.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nVelveeta Loaf Mexican Mild, 16-Ounce Loaves (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nNot as good as regular Velveeta, clumps, isn't as smooth when heated in salsa...doesn't mix as well, it settles to the bottom.\nRating:\n2.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'eat', 'one', 'chicken', 'get', 'would', 'taste', 'potatoes', 'could', 'little']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nLazy Day Foods Dark Chocolate Ginger Cookies, 4.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThese cookies arrived in the afternoon. They didn't sit in the mail box long, but I discovered upon opening them that the chocolate was seriously melted. I put the box in the refrigerator. Not the best idea obviously because now the cookies were cemented together by the chocolate. Obviously this is no fault of the cookie manufacturer, but I do want to make you aware of what you might be dealing with if you mail order these.\n\nI'm a hormonal woman, so I found a way to eat the cookies, though they were so messy I ended up eating over the sink and creating a huge chocolate mess on my hands and face--I looked like a three year old.\n\nWere they worth the trouble? Sadly no. Ginger? What ginger? The dark chocolate isn't bad, but the cookie tastes like nothing. I was really looking forward to eating a ginger cookie, but there wasn't even a hint of it.\n\nIf you're on a gluten-free diet, you might find these tasty. I'm not and didn't.\nRating:\n3.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

That is not an overstatement. He has been looking for a carbonated drink that has really sugar in it, is lightly sweetened and the flavor is light as well. He thinks the cherry flavor is great. I am not a huge fan of cherry overall (something to do with cherry flavored cough syrup as a child), and this drink did leave me with a distinctive cherry aftertaste that brought on some unpleasant flashbacks. I would love to try the ginger or vanilla flavors at some point.\n\nIngredients are simply purified carbonated water, pure can sugar, natural flavor and phosphoric acid. It is Non gmo verified. Each can has 60 calories and 15 grams of sugar. Nicely designed cans look pretty at a picnic, bar-b-que or in a lunch box.  Also, mixes well with spirits. On the dry sparkling website they have some fantastic drink recipes.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNestle Coffee-mate Coffee Creamer, French Vanilla, 21.1 oz liquid pump bottle\nReview:\nThere are 125 servings (equal to one creamer single cup). Since most people use 2 pumps per coffee mug, you will get a little over 60 cups of coffee flavoring out of this bottle. Depending on how you purchase your creamer and how often you use it whether this is a good deal or not.\n\nThe flavor is traditional French vanilla and is yummy in coffee. Do not refrigerate or liquid will harden. Perfect for the holidays when the frig is often over flowing and space is limited. Also great for office or small business.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSwanson 33% Less Sodium Broth, Chicken, 32 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nWe use the Swanson chicken broth in tons of recipes.

In fact, chilling it causes it to harden.  It is good for 30 days once opened.  Pump is packed separately in box with creamer. However, it is designed so that you cannot remove it once it is screwed on to creamer container. This is for health and safety reasons.\n\nCreamer has an excellent sweet cream taste, equivalent to adding half-and-half and sugar to your java. This 21.1 oz. bottle contains 125 servings. Each serving is equal to one single serve creamer.  I think typically people who like cream in coffee add 2-3 single creamers to a cup of coffee, so this container will last for 40- 60 cups of coffee.\n\nReally perfect if you are having company over the holidays, have a large household, small office, business or church.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Praline Pecans Stand-Up, Resealable Bag, 5.5 oz\nReview:\nAddictive.

I liked them all.  The peanut butter chocolate chip was the most \"desserty\" flavor of the bunch with a few chocolate chips in the bar.  The Cherries and Berries had some nice dried fruit chunks in it and a nutty sesame taste.  The Granola with Coconut tasted exactly as the name implies.  I will likely purchase the variety pack again instead of the single flavor boxes.  They do not have a lot of protein and are somewhat high in fat, are very moist and chewy, so they aren't what I am used to from my meal replacement bars (I really like Zone Perfect Fudge Graham bars - my kids also like them which is a bonus and a decent after school/before sports snack that transports easily in backpacks and sports bags).

I am in that second group, and the flavor on this doesn't disappoint. It has a very distinct raspberry aroma, with chocolate coming on behind that.  Not much coffee in the aroma, but it is there in the flavor, though it is very clear about being an unobtrusive light roast. Again, the raspberry is distinct on the flavor with the chocolate serving to enhance it and help it blend into the coffee.  I often drink regular coffee, so I treat flavors as a bit of a treat. Because of that, this lasted a long time for me, so I would probably buy a smaller size when purchasing again.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Figured I'd have myself a little truff party.  Well let me tell you, it's been a 2-week non-stop party in my mouth.  And you can be invited!  Well I guess the party would be in your mouth, but I digress.\n\nMy kitchen now smells like Umamiville, USA.  This is some seriously pungent stuff.  Mrs. Philyodaddy put the three aforementioned products in one drawer, which she started calling the truffle drawer (very clever lady that Mrs. P).  More like flavor country.\n\nSo far I have applied small doses of this product on: sandwiches, steak, salmon, other fish, cheese, chicken, pork, lamb, my finger, and other animals I cannot currently think of.  Everything was improved.  As you can see, I have an extremely healthy diet.  I might be going off the deep end a little, because Mrs. Philyodaddy is \"getting sick of truffles\".  Like that's possible.  Hey Mrs. P, maybe you should get sick of expensive purses or renttherunway.\n\nThe ratio is 95 parts salt for 5 parts truffle, not that I could tell.  It seems that there is real black truffle in as well as some sort of truffle flavor, but this is my first truffle salt, so I don't know if that's par for the truffcourse.  I would say, of the three truffle related products I've tried so far I like the salt the best, and a little goes a long way.

If I may be allowed use an analogy in SAT form, it would probably look something like- Sriracha : Tabasco :: Philyodaddy : People who stand on the left side of an escalator. See what I did there?\n\nHere is a list of things that are NOT made better by this Thai (apparently its from Thailand, now I know) delicacy:\nCereal\nFruit\nFruit-based deserts\nThat is all I got.

I, on the other hand, don't like it at all.  Thus the mid star rating.\n\nThe bar is all natural, organic, non-GMO and full of fatty peanut butter, wrapped in chocolatey crunchy oats.  I think where the bar loses for me is the chocolate taste is not great.  I like deep dark bitter chocolate and perhaps this one is a bit too sweet for me.\n\nGreat for instant calories - about 230 of them, 100 straight from fat.

Pouches\nReview:\nI really take offense at a solid brand like Nature Valley offering these addicting tiny bites to kids.\n\nThey are chocolatey and have a bit of a coconut flavor to them, although I only found Palm oil, not coconut in the ingredients.  Each little tiny bag has about a dozen or so tiny bite-sized bits.  Each bag has 150 calories, over one-third of those FAT and 24 more simple sugar carbs to boot, and 8 calories of protein, as well.  8 calories of protein.  8.\n\nThe label on the box says,  \"16 grams of whole grains and no artificial flavors, sweeteners, or colors.\"  So, you kind of think you are making a healthy choice.  And you are wrong.  You are feeding your child pure diabetes in bite-sized bits.  The fat comes primarily from Canola oil.  AND, WHAT IS Canola oil?  It's like Canadian Oil because they invented it and now 90% is a Monsanto creation.  Enough said about that?\n\nI didn't see an age on here, but toddlers and youngers have an added danger of choking, these are pretty small bits - see the picture I included.\n\nMy son sat down to try a bag of these, I gave him one pouch to each.  He ended up finding the box and then eating the ENTIRE BOX.  6 in a box x 150 calories each pouch = 900 calories.  O.M.G. and then he went on to eat his regular lunch.  Granted the kid is super skinny but NO CHILD NEEDS 900 calories in one sitting.\n\nI am not a big fan of these.  I am really mad at Nature Valley, famous for their oat bars, natural granola, to market such an addictive and sugary fat product to youngsters.

No two ways about it.  Many natural nut butters are.  This is NOT JIFF, so you need to get over the oily smooth texture.

It is on par with the very expensive brands I usually buy.  Since I used every last scrape of nut butter in a jar, I was really happy with this size.  It won't go stale.  (Sometimes the one from Costco is so big, by the end, you are out of the oil and it less butter and more like concrete.)\n\nThis is the third product I have from this company and they have all been outstanding.

I mean, the company motto is \"To make you feel good about snacking.\"\nUh, NO.  Not the case.  Each 3.3 ounce bag has 3 and a half servings.  And you can easily kill the whole bag.  EASILY.  And if you did kill the whole bag, thinking, \"OH, VEGGIES, GREAT,\" you would ingest, oh, 400 calories!  Enough for a small meal!!  And you would have ingested 4.5 grams of fat TIMES 3.3 ounces, so that's uh, close to FIFTEEN grams of fat in each bag?!?!?  WHHHHAAAT?  In one 3.3 ounce bag?!\n\nYeah, a bag of these healthy pea snacks could put your training program right over the rails.\n\nTake heart, as there is actually organic whole green pea flour in here, it is the first ingredient.  And then there's brown rice flour and then oil.  LOTS and LOTS of oil.  And cheddar cheese, yeast, etc.\n\nThey do taste pretty good, but these are NOT veggies.  Lipstick on the pig does not make it more beautiful.  It just makes it WEIRD.  And that's how I felt trying these out.  WEIRD.\n\nIf you need the splurge, go get some proper Lays chips, go crazy, get a flavor.  Get some pretzels.  Have a piece of cheese with them.

The ITC Hotel chefs who created this recipe are very well regarded in India. Its just the right mix for a spicy lamb curry, all you need to do is mix it with water and add the lamb and then let it simmer on your stove for 30-45 minutes to bring out the aromas and flavors. Really convenient and time saving.\n\nThe lamb curry paste is spicier than a butter chicken curry mix. The chicken curry usually has a more creamy consistency and is sweeter due to higher content of tomatoes. The lamb curry has a base of garlic, ginger, black pepper, onions, tomatoes and other highly aromatic Indian spices (bayleaf, cinnamon, star anise, cardamom, cloves, black cardamom, shah jeera, corriander seeds, red chilli powder etc.).\n\nI usually make my own curry as I prefer fresh ingredients but this mix is wonderful, it has just the right blend of spices that go into lamb curry. The secret to Indian food is to lower the flame once a curry boils and then simmer it for quite some time. This step is not a must if you're in a tearing hurry but it unlocks the real flavors.\n\nOnce done this curry keeps very well in the refrigerator. In fact, as with all spicy curries, it even tastes better the next day. I use two packets at a time to make an entree for 6 people.\n\nVariations:\nI sometimes add some 1X1.5 inch cubes of diced potatoes along with the lamb to absorb the spiciness which makes it into a \"Lamb Vindaloo\". Or you can use beef instead of lamb, it will taste great with any red meat that absorbs the spice.\n\nIf you're a vegetarian, you can use this curry with potatoes and green peas since the curry paste does not contain any meat in it. Just remember to add peas towards the end of the simmering process or they will get bleached out and you'll get a fantastic dish.\n\nPairing:\nPair this lamb curry with some aromatic basmati rice, cooked till all grains are done but still separate, and a bowl of plain yogurt (with a little sugar if you like) to counter the spiciness. Or you can also buy frozen Indian nan/roti from the local Indian grocery store, toast it in the oven and enjoy.

Since there are always figs in my pantry I was able to directly compare these to the usual California brands that I purchase.\n\nFirst, these are completely different. They are large, soft and moist in the center, and slightly sticky on the outside. Even the premium California figs I purchase locally seem mummified compared to these. The size is another factor - these are much larger.\n\nSecond, these have a natural sweetness that exceeds the California ones. Indeed, it comes close to the over ripe fresh figs of which I am fond when they are in season. Of course, there is nothing to my palate that compares to a fresh fig, but these will do nicely when the fresh ones are not in season.\n\nI did a quick taste test when I was comparing these using a few cheeses and a wine samples to augment the flavors. I found that the sweetness of these figs is prefect paired with pecorino romano (a very strong cheese of sheep milk), while the California fig against which I tested it was bland and overpowered. The three wines I tried were an Italian white (Gavi), a California red (pinor noir) and an Italian red (valpolicella ripasso). This fig went well with the Gavi and valpolicella, but not the pinot. The California fig was so tasteless in comparison that it went with (but was not enhanced by) all three wines. My conclusion is paring a contrasting cheese - especially a strong one - with either a crisp, dry white or heavier, dry red wine is a perfect match. I mention this because for cheese and wine sampling parties this is perfect for serving after the tasting because the high fiber will counter the tendency of the cheese to constipate guests.\n\nAdditional factors: the figs do not look exactly like those in the product images (at the time of this review). They are actually larger and flatter; and, the complete nutritional information in on the product photo of the actual container so I am not going to repeat it here. Also, the containers are relatively small (but this is a three pack, so the pricing is still competitive with my locally purchased ones). They are approximately four inches in diameter by two inches high. Finally, the packaging recommends that you refrigerate these after opening them. I do not - they dry out the figs. I store mine in a tightly sealed glass container in my pantry.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCinnamon Organic Saigon - Fine Powder - Naturally Sweet Flavor - Perfect for Cinnamon Rolls, Apple Pie, Baking, Smoothies - Unprocessed &amp; Hand Harvested - 100% Satisfaction\nReview:\nCompared to cinnamon sticks and the usual grocery store fare Saigon cinnamon is potent, more aromatic and literally explodes with flavor.\n\nUse two thirds of what you would normally use or it will be bitter. In fact, like other brands I have tried this is fresh and potent enough to get by with a half of what you would normally use. You can always add a pinch more, but cannot remove it. Experiment if you have never used this Vietnamese spice because it's definitely like cinnamon on steroids. I use this mixed with either honey or unsweetened applesauce as a topping on baked sweet potatoes. I also add a pinch to coffee grounds before brewing when I want a special treat.\n\nThis does NOT come in sticks because the nature of the bark from which this comes is too delicate to harvest in stick form. On the other hand, I have never had a cinnamon stick that came close to flavor and fragrance as this stuff, so do not let the powdered form fool you into thinking that there is something better out there. There isn't.\n\nIf you cook or bake with cinnamon and have never experienced this variety it's definitely worth checking out.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDancing Moon Sumatra Mandheling Whole Bean Organic Fair Trade Antioxidant Coffee, 2 lbs.\nReview:\nI received this as a free review sample to try after criticizing the roast of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dancing-Moon-Ethiopian-Yirgacheffe/dp/B00TXMKZBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dancing Moon Ethiopian Yirgacheffe</a>, which I thought was over roasted. This one is perfectly roasted for the bean type. It's dark (the Sumatra Mandheling is best that way), but not oily, which would indicate over roasting.\n\nThe flavor was typical Mandheling, with a full, rich body, low acidity and complex with earthy dominating, but a touch of sweet and - to my palate - an ineffable flavor that I cannot identify, but lingers in a pleasant way.\n\nWhen I test coffee I have a specific process. I always grind with a manual, ceramic burr grinder so as to not burn or burnish the beans, and I use a bottled water (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Acqua-Panna/dp/B004AHBH38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acqua Panna</a>) when brewing because that water is totally neutral. Sadly that water is too expensive for daily brewing, but it contributes to a perfect cup of coffee. I also brew two ways: in a French Press and in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bialetti-6799-Moka-Express-3-Cup-Stovetop-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0000CF3Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bialetti 6799 Moka Express 3-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a>. This particular bean and grind brewed perfectly in both. I had expected a better brew from the French press, but surprisingly the moka did an equally nice job. In fact that brewer brought out nuances that the French press did not.\n\nMy only complaint is there is no roast date on the bag. There is a 'use by' sticker, but that does not tell you how long ago it has been roasted - and is important to we coffee fanatics.\n\nBottom line: I loved this particular bean and roast so much that I will probably be ordering a bag every few months - it's that good.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nViva Naturals Organic Quinoa, 4 LB - 100% Royal Bolivian Whole Grain\nReview:\nI received a bag of this as a review sample and had other quinoa in my pantry to which to compare against. The grains in this bag were dry, fresh and had a slightly grassy flavor when I tasted a few grains. In contrast, the other brand I have in my pantry was not as pleasant to the palate (raw). The grains in this bag were smaller and more uniform as well.\n\nThis one soaked and cooked about five minutes quicker as well, compared to the brand I had been using.\n\nAs for the claims that this is non-GMO I have no way to verify that, but it's an important feature for me. I endeavor to eat only natural foods that are as pure as possible.\n\nOther reviewers have provided recipes and other information, so I will not repeat them. I will say that I've\\ been eating quinoa for years because it is healthier on my system than most other grains. This is one of the higher quality bags that I have some across and I do know the difference. If you are exploring the health benefits there is plenty of information on the web. If you already consume quinoa this is truly a quality grain that is noticeably better than bulk bags (and even the giant plastic jars that some brands use).\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nThai Kitchen Fish Sauce, 6.76 oz\nReview:\nI can purchase this locally from a number of sources, including the dominant supermarket chain in Central Florida. Therefore my review will focus on this fish sauce and not address price or shipping.\n\nNot all fish sauces are created equal. I spent a lot of my life in Asia and was first introduced to this in the Philippines where it's called patis. This is identical to a high quality patis in all respects.  Do be aware that this, like patis or other Thai brands, is extremely high in sodium. A single gram of this sauce contains 890mg. That means that a teaspoon contains a whopping 4450mg, so use it very sparingly if you have sodium restrictions.\n\nMy main use is to chop fresh bird's eye peppers and make a combination dipping sauce and condiment that is called phrik nam pla in Thai. It's also delicious by itself on on grilled eggplant and zucchini, and especially pork (which I have not eaten in decades but did enjoy with this sauce when I did consume it.)  Actually, this is perfect on mixed grilled or fried vegetables and will enhance many dishes if used in lieu of salt or soy sauce.\n\nBottom line: this is a quality fish sauce that is identical to patis and the equal of any brand I have used.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nThai Kitchen Fish Sauce, 6.76 oz\nReview:\nThis is identical to the the top brands of the Philippine version called patis. It has the same purity and flavor, and can easily compete with my other favorite brand made by Tiparos. I switched to this brand mainly for convenience when I discovered it on a shelf at my local grocery store. That was a shock in itself, but a pleasant one.\n\nI use this - sparingly - on grilled eggplant and zucchini, and to make a hot dipping sauce called nam pra prik. That sauce can be easily made by finely chopping hot peppers (bird's eye chillies are the best) and adding them to this fish sauce.\n\nAlthough I haven't eaten pork in decades this was a perfect condiment for it when I did.  The flavor of mixed grilled or fried vegetables is also greatly enhanced by using a few drops of this in lieu of salt or soy sauce.\n\nDo be aware that this, like patis or other Thai brands, is extremely high in sodium. A single gram of this sauce contains 890mg. That means that a teaspoon contains a whopping 4450mg, so use it very sparingly if you have sodium restrictions.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nJoyfuel Organic Raw Cacao Powder, Rich Dark Chocolate, 16 Ounce (1 lb) Bag\nReview:\nWhen I received this as a review sample I just had to try a little on my finger. It had that rich, slightly bitter taste of an excellent grade of cacao. I stirred a little into a cup of coffee and it complemented it perfectly. I was impressed by how easily it dissolved into the brew as though it were sugar. But know that it's anything but sweet (no quality cacao is).\n\nI know that this is supposed to have health benefits, some of which I know first hand from using cacao for quite some time. I have not had this long enough to say one way or the other. What I can say, though, is I have tried a lot of cacao in my life and this one is everything the product description claims as far as quality goes. In fact, if you make mole poblano from scratch, you'll appreciate this because it has a richness that you will not find in grocery store cacao or cocoa.\n\nThe reason why I awarded this five stars are it is genuine Criollo, it's non GMO (a big deal for me), and the intense flavor and characteristic bitter aftertaste. If you do a lot of gourmet cooking using cacao this is worth every penny. If you are looking for the health benefits, I am not going to make claims other than to say that this is an exceptionally high quality grade. For me it's going to be a cooking ingredient, something to enrich after dinner coffee for me and guests, and as a sprinkle over confections made with mascapone cheese. I am sure I'll think of other uses, but when this runs out I am purchasing another bag.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nIsland Fresh Superior Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 Ounce\nReview:\nI received this as a free review sample. First, I want to address the 'extra virgin' claim. This oil was probably made by drying the coconut meat, then pressing it. That is a common method for making oil of the highest quality, but it is totally different from making olive oil. The EV designation can be confusing to cooks who are expecting a true grading system. There isn't one that is universally accepted for coconut oil. This does not detract from the quality of the oil, but I wanted to set expectations if you are new to it.\n\nMy testing was strictly in food preparation. I used this in lieu of olive oil to prepare sea bass, as well as to make a Filipino dish called binagoongang gatas (a dish from the Bikol region of southern Luzon.) In both cases this oil proved to be very high quality. On the sea bass it was a subtle difference. So subtle, in fact, that you probably would not be able to tell which was which if I were to identically prepare one using olive oil and one using this oil.\n\nFor the Filipino dish this is as real time saver. I typically boil coconut milk in a skillet until it flashes into oil, then continue with the rest of the recipe. Here I had oil to start with and it was just as good as the longer method I was accustomed to using. For me that is a big plus.\n\nNote that once opened DO NOT refrigerate this oil. It will harden. It should actually last a good six months at room temperature if tightly sealed.\n\nAs for health benefits, I am not going to make claims one way or the other. Honestly, I do not know and even though I have been using coconut oil for cooking long before I tried this one, I would be lying if I said that made a difference. There are too many other variables in my diet.\n\nBottom line: this is a high quality coconut oil that is perfect for cooking. I think it's vastly superior to most vegetable oils, and while olive oil is my most used oil, this one is perfect for many dishes.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nVanilla Bean Powder, 3.53 Oz - Raw Ground Vanilla Bean - Unsweetened, Gluten-Free - EXTREMELY FRESH - Ground Moments Before Packaging!\nReview:\nI have used vanilla powder before, as well as genuine vanilla extract, so I had a good idea of that to expect when I accepted a review sample. This powder lived up to my expectations.\n\nWhile I sometimes use this in baking, my main use is flavoring a concoction that I am fond of: vanilla, milk and honey (and sometimes with an egg dropped in). I blend it and the drink is a wonderful pick-me-up. It's also healthy and is a great substitute for a meal.\n\nNote: this is pure vanilla, so do not expect it to be sweet. Like cacao, pure vanilla is not at all sweet and has a slight hint of bitter. I use honey, but just about any sweetener will work well with it. It dissolves fairly well in liquids. Not perfectly or completely unless you use a blender, but sufficiently so to make drinks like I mentioned above. It also adds a touch of flavor when sprinkled over pasties. I tried it on French toast with just butter and a slight touch of genuine maple syrup and it was delicious.\n\nI am not going to delve into the health advantages of pure vanilla because - frankly - I have no evidence one way or the other. In that respect I made no effort to validate the antioxidant properties. I enjoy this solely for the flavor, so if you are interested in the health benefits some research may provide answers one way or the other. For me, this is one of the best ingredients for healthy energy drinks, as well as for both sweet and savory dishes. It's perfect for adding a touch of bitter to balance out a flavor profile of a savory dish, as well as making some wonderful cakes and cookies. And a little of this goes a long way.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLee Kum Kee Guilin Style Chili Sauce - 8 oz.\nReview:\nI love hot sauces and love experimenting with various ones. Lately I have been using a lot of products from this brand and this one is among my favorites.\n\nThe reason I love it is the flavor and the piquant character balance one another. Of course the piquant factor dominates the flavor profile (although this is not super spicy to my palate). The garlic is easily detected, but the surprise is the sweet aspect of the flavor profile, which seems to dominate more than the salt.\n\nAbout the piquant quality - this does have a slight bite and some spiciness, but if you can tolerate a serrano pepper you will not have any problems. For me I prefer a little more spiciness so I will often add some finely chopped bird's eye chilis to the sauce. Of course spiciness is both subjective and relative. If a jalapeno is too hot for you may want to avoid this. On the other hand, if a habanero is not enough, you will have to kick it up with additional peppers.\n\nTo me it's all about flavor and this one has it. It not only works with stir fry dishes, but also in American dishes like grilled beans and as the base for stews and soups. A dab of this when making scampi will add a lot to that dish as well.\n\nNutritionally a teaspoon contains only 10 calories and a single gram of carbs. However, it also contains 410mg of sodium, so if you have restrictions note that and use this sparingly. In fact, use it as a condiment in lieu of salt on some dishes for a real treat.\n\nIf you love spicy sauces and want to fuse Chinese flavors into your tried and true menus, or to make authentic Chinese dishes this is a great shortcut. It's earned a spot in my pantry.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['flavor', 'one', 'also', 'use', 'sodium', 'like', 'sauce', 'coffee', 'love', 'quality']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nPopchips 4-Flavor Tortilla Variety Pack, 3.5-Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nsome of the flavors were good but most were very \"cardboardy\" and for the price i ws very disappointed !\nRating:\n1.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

But every so often, when a company does go organic, it doesn't mean they have a product that will taste as good. That is proof of the pudding with their Kashi Cinnamon Harvest cereal. While it is a good concept, my basic gripe about it is the fact that there could've beena  bit more cinnamon and sugar in the cereal. It would've been a lot tastier to stand up to those other cereals from Kellog's and General Mills to name a few. Still if you're a health nut whom likes organic cereals, than give Kashi's Cinnamon Harvest cereal a try.\n\nPrice: C+\n\nTaste: C+\n\nOverall: C+\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBoost Calorie Smart 100 Calories, Balanced Nutritional Drink, Vanilla Caramel, 4 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 4)(16 Bottles Total)\nReview:\nThere is honestly so much that I have loved about Boost. They have had really good energy drinks that have definitely been great supplements for me and my whole family. But honestly, with all the nutrition, they have wanted to take a step back and try to do something in the way with what Slim-Fast had done for so many years, and try to make a leaner drink line for your life. This honestly is a nice stepping stone with their 100 calorie smart nutritional drink tastes not too shabby, and has just as much taste as the regular line of nutritional supplemental drinks. What I do like about it is that they do taste great in chocolate drinks. The sincere bad news is that you only get 4 bottles, rather than 6 unlike their lines of other drinks from their supplemental line. Still, they do taste great for the money, but I do wish that more could have been done for the money alone with this one that could have been more of a boost.\n\nPrice: C+\n\nTaste & Quality: B-\n\nOverall: C+\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nHealthy Choice Zesty Gumbo Soup, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI absolutely love a nice, hot steaming bowl of soup once in awhile. Fortunately, Healthy Choice makes a nice arrangement of taste and quality with their soups. Their Zesty Gumbo soup however, isn't one of their best flavors. While the soup does blend in a unique blend of chicken, rice celery and flavor, there unfortunately lacks a bit of spice in the flavor by not adding enough garlic or zest from onions or cheese to the taste of the tongue. On top of that, it also lacks by not adding enough sausage in the gumbo, unlike Cambell's Chunky or Progresso's Chicken & Sausage Gumbo. It isn't a bad soup for the price if you're health-smart, but at least it is better than Cambell's putting sea salt in their lower sodium soups.

Fortunately, Melitta knows that feeling with their coffees, and make them well from the heart. Their French Vanilla is a delightful tast that just melts your heart away. It is delicious after the first cup, and just everlasting. My one and only gripe with Melitta though is that with their ground coffees is that they are very hard to open the cans, considering you'd have to use a regular can opener to get them open, rather than peel the top off from Folgers or Maxwell House. That definitely is the only thing that is not only frustrarting, but can easily cause the consumer to break the can. Still, the taste is great and if you want a nice soulfully delightful cup of joe, Melitta can take you there.\n\nPrice: B-\n\nTaste: A-\n\nConvience: B-\n\nOverall: B\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBrookside Dark Chocolate Fruit and Nut Bar Assortment, 25.20 Ounce\nReview:\nThese days, it has been much harder to find nutritious snack bars that really appeal not just in taste, but in quality. I have honestly been interested in cocoa that not only taste good, but it has to really feel you from the soul. But also, I had been also looking into more nutritious fruit and nuts bars that can only be chewy, but also with more coatings of yogurt, and make you taste nutrition, but not lose any value overall. I have tried Brookside's products before with their chocolate covered berries and I did love them because you really tasted a lot for the money. But now, they have yogurt covered fruit and nut bars too. Their vanilla yogurt fruit and nut bars actually taste very good, and have a hint of Greek yogurt with each and every bite. I honestly fell in love with it from the very first taste. It really does rival other nutritious bars from brands like Kind and Nature Valley very well. If you really want a nice alternative to everyday snack bars, this is one I suggest you give this one a try.\n\nPrice: B\n\nQuality & Taste: A-\n\nOverall: B+\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Melitta Hazelnut Creme Ground Coffee, 11.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4) \nReview:\nIt just feels like everyday, a great cup of coffee is a simple way to start off your everyday morning just right. While I've had so many different coffee brands like Maxwell Houde & store brands, I don't really feel the simplicity of seeing great flavors in ground in the stores anymore. Melita though does know how to simply make a strong cup of coffee that can simply make your day strong, and that is the case with the taste of their Hazelnut Creme ground coffee. The coffee tastes purely delightful, and stronger than the ones that you'd get at Dunkin' Donuts, or any other store chain. I love the aroma from beginning to end. My only one big gripe with the coffee is that it is harder to open after you open the lid. You'd also have to use the aid of a can opener to get the coffee open afterwards, but it definitely is worth the wait. If you want a zesty and smooth hazelnut taste, than I really suggest you get Melita's Hazelnut Creme coffee.\n\nQuality: A-\n\nPrice: B+\n\nOverall: B+\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nMelitta Fair Trade Organic Coffee, Morning Bliss Ground, Light Roast, 10 ounce\nReview:\nThere is no question about the fact that I honestly adore a nice and simple tasting cup of coffee to start my day. But Melitta has not been a great company that produces the best coffee filters, but they've also got some really strong coffee flavors to call their own. That comes with their cafe collection, and their Hazelnut Creme Brulee. The taste is absolutely very smooth and mild to the taste buds, yet remain sophisticated and strong from the first time you simply whiff the smell and aroma. I absolutely loved the taste of it from the very first sip. I absolutely recommend this as another delightful flavor in your morning cup of joy in the morning.

With hazelnut, the crunch and flavor has a pleasant exotic texture.\n\nThe hazelnut flavor is not subtle. For me, this is a good thing, and, as a result, I can devour two bars faster than I should.\n\nDistribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate, although they also make varieties which include yogurt, nuts and a version with Oreo Cookies. Buy a case of the hazelnut Milka and enjoy!\n\nAnthony Trendl\neditor, [...]\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

The lemon and ginger are strong flavors, and the tea color is far darker than most lemon ginger teas I've had.  I opened one of the single serves and found that the tea is more finely ground than those in loose tea mixes or tea bags.  Maybe this finer grinding allows more flavor to be brewed into the cup.\n\nI like it plain when it's hot and with honey for a sweeter taste when served as iced tea.\n\nIf you're fond of citrus and ginger, you'll like this tea.

It's simply the opinion of someone who enjoys delicious foods and snacks.  Larabar's Renola is a tasty granola substitute for those who are looking for a non-wheat granola product.\n\nHowever, when I eat granola, I want crunch and this doesn't have it.  It does have almonds, pecans, cashews, sunflower and pumpkin  seeds and you'd expect a wonderfully crunchy texture from them, but maybe the fruit (raisins) and tapioca syrup soften them.\n\nThe flavor is sweet (dried molasses) and satisfying for a sweet tooth urge.  The cinnamon is mild and tasty, too.  They make the nuggets taste good.\n\nThe 200 calories for a 1.25 oz. serving seems awfully high, especially when 130 of them come from fat.  Unless you are desperate for a tiny splurge, I can think of better ways to consume 10% of the USDA's recommended daily allotment of a 2,000 calorie diet.  Please understand, if your needs are for non-gluten, this can more than meet your desire for a quick snack.  But, if you can partake of other options, I'd take a pass on this product.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Honey Roasted Peanuts, Golden Roast, 14 oz\nReview:\nThese FISHER Honey Dry Roast Peanuts are delicious!

Let me tell you why I bought it.  I wanted to make a pastry (almond crescents/horns) that requires one pound of almond paste.  At my local supermarket this sells for nearly $1/ounce--far too costly!  I looked at Amazon's price and determined that I could make almond paste for less than half that price.\n\nThe box came well-packaged and swiftly with Amazon Prime delivery.  I made two pounds of almond paste from just one bag of almond flour and will freeze the second pound for making marzipan.  The remaining three bags are stored in freezer bags in my freezer and will eventually be used in pie crusts, cookies, etc.\n\nThe almond flour blended perfectly with the other ingredients and produced an excellent paste.  The quality was very good; there were no dark spots (from almond skins), the flour had no lumps and appeared to be fresh.\n\nThis is a brand you can rely on and I do--again and again.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBelly Flops (Irregular Jelly Beans) by Jelly Belly - 2 lb Bag; 32 oz\nReview:\nIf you've eaten Jelly Belly beans, you know how tasty they are.  Each tiny 'bean' is a colorful burst of gummy flavor.  In this package, you will find the appropriately named mistakes, 'Belly Flops'.  These are the beans that didn't meet production standards for size, shape, or perhaps, became stuck to another bean--twins, how yummy.  There's absolutely no difference in taste, just their appearance.  Each two-pounds bag contains a delicious, large variety of flavors of these cute, little beans.\n\nWhether you buy them for yourself or, give them as a gift, they're sure to bring smiles of appreciation.  We mix the 'Flops' with the regular beans.  When scooping up a handful you'll never know what surprises you may encounter, making this treat even more fun to eat.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Praline Pecans Stand-Up, Resealable Bag, 5.5 oz\nReview:\nFISHER's Roasted Salted Pecans are scrumptious!  Each nut (some are full halves, some are large pieces) has a light sprinkling of salt and is perfectly roasted.  These nuts are good to eat right out of the re-sealable package and can be stored for future snacking without their becoming soggy.\n\nA serving size is 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup) and contains 200 calories.  The problem is that they're so good, it's hard to stop with one serving.\n\nThe pecans are good on salads, on top of ice cream and I've even tried baking chocolate chip cookies with them.  Just use unsalted butter and add about half of the salt your usual recipe calls for.  I put these FISHER's Roaste4d Salted Pecans out for company with dried fruits, cheeses, and crackers.  Everyone complimented the nuts first.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBreadtopia Sourdough Starter (Live)\nReview:\nThis product delivers.  Literally.  The San Francisco Sourdough Yeast arrived quickly; the starter is of excellent quality, and the rapid customer service (Rosalyn answered my online questions on a Sunday!) was about the best I have ever experienced.  Good things do come in small packages and this sourdough starter is no exception.\n\nAs I write this my dough is proofing and that singular San Francisco aroma tells me this is the real thing.  M-m-m.  I close my eyes and remember that delicious, yeasty sourdough from Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nThe only caveat comes with following the directions.  After the first feeding of the yeast with bread flour and water, the directions state to discard all but  cup, which can be used to make pancakes or biscuits.  (The pancakes were delicious.)  The second and third feedings each require adding  cup water and slightly less than 1 cup (I used 7/8 cup) bread flour.\n\nThe Sourdough Bread recipe calls for 2 1/3 cups of starter.  Take my advice.  Keep your discarded excess starter (remember, you keep only  cup of it each of the three times) in the refrigerator.  You may use it to create additional starters in order to have enough (2 1/3 cups) to begin making your dough.  Alternatively, take your final (third) proofing, using  cup of it to have enough multiples to make 2 1/3 cups of starter for your dough.\n\nThe best place for the yeast to activate was in the oven, with the oven light remaining on.  It gives off sufficient heat for a perfect environment and was free from drafts.\n\nMy dough (2 lbs.,14.5 oz.)  is ready to be punched down and I see that I'll be able to get two large or three medium loaves.\n\nOne final word:  This does not perform like bread using rapid rise yeast.  Give yourself a week to proof your sourdough yeast, make your dough and allow it rise two times (each rise can be from 12-24 hours).  Good things come to those who wait...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Cashew Halves &amp; Pieces, Stand-Up Bag, Gluten Free, 5 oz\nReview:\nThe Fisher nuts' label states that the nuts are \"whole cashews\".  But that's not correct.  They are small pieces, halves, and only some are whole nuts.  In addition, these nuts are quite small; not at all like the premium size you may be accustomed to buying.  The nuts have a slightly oily texture that I find detracts from their quality.  To their credit, they are lightly salted and not overly so.\n\nI've really liked Fisher's other nuts:  honey roasted peanuts, macadamia nuts, etc., and that's why I wanted to try these.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  Because of the mis-labeling and oily feel, they get just two stars.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nTraditional Medicinals Organic Chamomile Herbal Leaf Tea, 16 Tea Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIf you love the peppery flavor of ginger, this tea is for you.

I've tried other brands and they just aren't as potent.\n\nWhether you drink it strictly for taste or use it to soothe your stomach, this one's a great choice.  If you're drinking it just for enjoyment, try this:  steep your tea, allowing the bag to sit in the water until it's cool.  Add honey, stir, and pour over ice.

I question the labeling as Organic Superfood because I do not consider any sugar to be a superfood, but in moderation, if you are going to use sugar, this is one to consider.  The color of the sugar is brown, the texture is moist and fine.  It doesn't clump as quickly as brown sugar, but I haven't had an opened bag around long enough for that to occur.  Each pound is in a sturdy resealable bag and there's an interesting recipe on the back of the bag which I intend to try.

They seem to be expensive, though, for non-Organic walnut halves.  I bake a lot and have an ample supply of walnuts, pecans and almonds at the very least in the pantry and freezer. Seriously, I must go through a pound or two a week. I recently opened another brand's sealed and \"fresh\" bag of walnuts that were rancid, so I will never buy that brand again. These, on the other hand, were delicious straight out of the bag. I'm using these nuts in their out of the bag unchopped form and will use my other favorite bag for recipes requiring smaller pieces. These are especially tasty when baked and bitten into while warm, as the flavors and oils come forward. They are also excellent when spiced as a snack with cocktails! I prefer pecans over walnuts, but I tend to look for quality nuts at a reasonable price and would repurchase these if the price was right.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNavitas Organics Cacao Nibs, 8 oz.

When out of cocoa powder, I needed to bake a batch of Alice Medrich's Best Cocoa Brownies for an event and was short on time.  Remembering the cacao powder in the cupboard, I took a chance and was rewarded with a batch of brownies that drew more compliments than ever before, and I'm always praised for the brownies I bake.  They were especially bittersweet and didn't require the addition of espresso powder which I often add to chocolate baked recipes.  The ultra fudgy brownies were great with nuts, without nuts, and in the fresh batch I baked yesterday, I brought out the chocolate flavor the best so far with the addition of rehydrated cherries, cranberries and chopped figs.  I'd recommend thinking out of the box with this cacao powder and although it may lose some of the nutritional benefits with cooking, it sure does produce great baked goods if you are willing to taste your batter, adjust as necessary, and take a chance.  The above mentioned recipe was a perfect use because the cacao powder is cooked with butter and sugar initially and that's used instead of the typical chocolate chunks in brownie recipes.  Oh yes, in all recipes, I also added some chocolate chips -- found the extra bitter chips weren't as good as the semi-sweet because of the natural bitterness of the cacao powder.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBobo's Oat Bar (Banana Chocolate Chip, 12 Pack of 3 oz Bars) Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oat Bar - Great Tasting Vegan On-The-Go Snack, Made in the USA\nReview:\nI've purchased 4 boxes of Bobo's Oat Bars in the Chocolate variety from Amazon in the past month.  An acquaintance had told me how delicious they were, so I took a chance and purchased my first box before I embarked on a trip, planning to take some along for the journey.  Unfortunately for my wallet, every person but one to whom I gave a bar loved these, so I sent some a box to enjoy.  Prior to my first purchase, I did not realize these are soft, sort of brownie like in texture, a little sweet in a molasses sort of way (no molasses in the recipe, though), crumbly, and with two servings in a single bar.  Fortunately, I placed a bar in a small resealable plastic bag for the airplane trip, so I was able to break off a little piece any time I felt hungry.  That bag was a saving grace because when a bar was gone, I replaced it with another and you won't believe how often I pulled out that little bag.  I ordered the first box as a gift after I put a little bite into my father's mouth while he was busy enjoying himself at a slot machine and I realized that he needed to keep these on hand for him and Mom to have on the days they go out.  For those who have few teeth, these are edible because of the soft texture, yet they provide an enjoyable flavor.  Hiker's took these along for a day trip, not worrying about the double serving per package, happily eating the entire bar.  As they put it, they felt like they had a brownie along for the trek, much more enjoyable than other bars they'd taken in the past.  One sister has enjoyed these on days when she's been unable to break for lunch at work, having them with coffee or tea and some deep breaths.  Without eggs, butter or flour, they are terrific, even though Earth Balance has never been my favorite flavor.  I'll admit that I was expecting a firmer bar with visible chocolate chips, but after the surprise of a crumbly moist baked good with a not very sweet cocoa flavor, I was hooked.  I will gladly try the other varieties when I can find them for a lower cost than over two dollars per bar.  A retail value of about thirty dollars is too high for a dozen bars, so I've deducted a star from this review.  The one friend who did not love her Bobo's Oat Bar thought it tasted like cardboard and she claimed to have forced it down at work.  She loves the SOYJOY bars which I do not care for, so I guess the world is balanced.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Certified Organic, non-GMO, Vegan Hazelnut Spread with Cocoa, Chia and Flaxseed, Classic Chocolate, 13-ounce\nReview:\nI prefer the darkest, most bitter chocolates. Hazelnuts are a favorite, but I love nearly all nuts if they are fresh. Sugar seldom entices me, but watch out if a bag of savory snacks is opened in the house.\n\nThe nutiva organic hazelnut spread surprised me because the 13 ounce jar is smaller than I imagined it would be. The information on the label appealed to me because the product is organic, non GMO, gluten-free, vegan, and it contains 12 grams of sugar in 2 tablespoons which is more than I will use at a time. The calories in that serving ar 210 with 15 grams of fat. It has no cholesterol. In this spread that contains 40% less sugar than the leading brand which we all know is Nutella, the first ingredient is cane sugar. I'm surprised to read that this may contain traces of milk solids which to me says it would not be vegan, but what do I know? I again was surprised when I opened the jar of classic organic hazelnut spread with cocoa and after prying off the seal, discovered a very thin product which I tried to stir with a very fancy spoon. There was nothing solid at the bottom of the jar, it was all the same thin consistency which reminded me of Hershey's syrup from years ago. I coated the spoon and tasted this product only to discover that I love it. It is not overly sweet and the cocoa comes through clearly with a very strong hazelnut aftertaste. There are no synthetic additives in this fair trade certified product of the United States. It is recommended that this not be refrigerated even after opening the jar which makes it much easier to keep in an office setting inside a desk drawer for quick access. I think it's that good.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKIND Bars, Dark Chocolate Nuts &amp; Sea Salt, Gluten Free, 1.4 Ounce Bars, 12 Count\nReview:\nI received the package of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/KIND-Nuts-Spices-Dark-Chocolate-Nuts-Sea-Salt-12-Count-Bars/dp/B007PE7ANY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">KIND Nuts & Spices, Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt, 12-Count Bars</a>&nbsp;in the early evening, so it had been sitting in the shipper's truck all day in the heat.

Regardless, when brought back to a temperature closer to the 80 degree range, I eagerly tore open a cellophane package and carefully peeled it back to try my first KIND bar.  With the first bite, I was impressed by the great flavor of fresh nuts and simple dark chocolate, even after exposed to the environmental heat.  On the second bite, I was hit with the sea salt, making me think about how smart it is to add sea salt instead of using salted nuts which I sometimes do when making chocolate covered nuts.  That creates an inconsistent salt burst which I find appealing.  At the small size of 1.4 ounces, it's loaded with fiber from the nuts and chicory root fiber, with relatively little sugars.  I personally would seldom consider eating one of these as a meal, but would have it as a filling food when needed in times where a meal could not be obtained.  I would supplement this and would not rely on this alone for nutrition!  Without further information on what else is included in the diet, I don't understand how the \"Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center indicates that eating 2 KIND bars each day helps maintain your weight through low glycemic, deliciously satisfying, nutritionally rich ingredients that will keep you fuller longer.\"  I think that 400 calories of intake per day is too much for any snack item.  With that being said, I now carry one of these bars with me instead of another grain type bar for the times when I absolutely need something to eat or desire a chocolate fix.  When I have these, I no longer carry a little bag of nuts either.  Because I haven't yet purchased bars which haven't been heated, I can only say that those I've received are not visually appealing and require eating directly from the cellophane because the bits of chocolate fall away.  Despite that flaw, these are a great snack item that I will be purchasing and will try other varieties as well.  I would like to see these offered at a better value when purchased in a box rather than the current cost at about eighteen dollars for a pound box of twelve bars.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nVedica Organics - Organic Turmeric (Curcumin) Spice Powder (3 oz)\nReview:\nSeems like everyone is into turmeric these days.  You can buy it by the ounce, pound or capsule.  I like this particular organic turmeric powder but think it is currently overpriced.  It is securely packaged in a sealed plastic jar with a dispensing cap and screw top and since the powder is vibrant in color and I want it to stay that way, I have transferred mine into a glass jar and keep it in a cabinet.  The powder tastes very good and blends well with other spices for assorted curry blends.  There are currently a number of organic turmeric powders available and this one is fine.  Vedica Organics provided a sample for review at an extremely reduced cost.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKIND Sweet and Spicy Bars, Korean Chili, Gluten Free, 10g Plant Protein, 1.6oz, 12 Count\nReview:\nA few years ago, I started purchasing KIND bars from Amazon, then picked them up when I found them on sale in local stores.  Favorites have been those with dark chocolate and nuts, sea salt, and the coconut almond.  I recently discovered a new favorite which is unlike any other I've tried.

Now right off the bat, I will say that not everyone will like these.  They are savory and since everyone in my household is a savory snack snackster, these are a huge hit and I purchased another dozen bars.  Roasted jalapeno is also known as chipotle, so the smoky heat combined with the minimally sweet nut and protein based bar just pops.  If you like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Texas-Pepper-Works-Candy-Krisp-Jalapenos/dp/B008YCDBGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Texas Pepper Works Candy-Krisp Jalapenos</a>&nbsp;offered on Amazon (and stacked in my pantry), chances are that you'll also like these high protein bars.  I always carry a KIND bar in my bag and find that with no chocolate, I don't have a gooey mess if it's kept in a hot environment.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWholesome Organic Pancake Syrup, Non GMO, 20 fl oz (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI always have maple syrup in the pantry as well as honey and molasses.

It looks like the syrup from my youth or on the table at IHOP, and it tastes very similar, too.  This is not maple syrup and it's not honey, but it is made of only three things, Organic Invert Sugar Cane Syrup, Natural Flavor, Organic Caramel Color.  Nothing more, nothing less.  It pours like a pancake syrup usually pours, a little thicker than maple syrup, but thinner than honey which isn't a syrup.  It is dark in color and is bottled in a comfortably round plastic bottle with a nice pour top.  There is a protective seal which must be removed prior to using.  I'm going to try some in the next batch of honey sesame candies I'm making tomorrow because I think it will work well.  Of course, six bottles of this is a lot, so I'd recommend being sure you like it before ordering 120 ounces.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTERRA Sweets &amp; Beets Chips, No Salt Added, 6 oz.

Oz., All-Natural, Artisanal, Great for Salads, Grilled Fish and Meat, or Pasta\nReview:\nI have used this oil for salad dressings and to drizzle over veggies instead of butter. I can't say that is adds flavor, but it is definitely more healthy to use than other oils. This particular oil should not be used for frying as it does not have a high heat tolerance. I have used it in baked recipes and it does well. I have also bought the Special Edition Walnut oil directly from the company. It is a lot more expensive, but it does have a definite nutty flavor. I have also used the Special Edition on veggies, and it does add a good nutty flavor.\n\nI have used a number of the La Tourangelle oils and have not been disappointed with any of them. I have completely eliminated the use of non-nut oils to improve the quality of fats that we eat. When buying these nut oils, it is important to pay attention to which can be used with low heat or medium to high heat. It is also important to note which require refrigeration after opening - some do and some don't. To be on the safe side, I refrigerate all of them after opening. I think it helps to keep them fresher.\n\nAlthough some of the Amazon reviews dock stars for dented cans, this is not fair to the product, nor does it deteriorate or affect the quality of the product.

Oz, All-Natural, Artisanal, Great for Salads, Fruit, Fish, Marinades or Vegetables\nReview:\nThis one of the many La Tourangelle oils that I use. I particularly like this one because it can be used at higher temperatures. I haven't use vegetable or canola oils for a very long time, and prefer to use the healthier nuts oils for all of my cooking. This, and other, nut oils are used exclusively for all frying and baking. I substitute nut oils for oils used in all of my recipes, and the work wonderfully. In fact, my bread recipes seem to work better using these oils.\n\nAlthough nut oils still include fats, they are healthy fats, and do not have a negative effect on cholesterol or weight gain. Your body needs fats to function, but healthy fats are more beneficial.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Frontier Garlic Powder, 16 Ounce Bags (Pack of 2) \nReview:\nI use a lot of garlic powder, and I have found that the garlic powder purchased from the store is truly a powder. It is hard to mix with other ingredient, especially liquid, and tends to clump. I would describe this garlic powder as more of a fine granulated garlic. The smell is much more like fresh garlic. I can't say that I save money buying this garlic powder as 2 lbs. in the store actually costs a bit less in this area. The whole idea of using herbs and spices is to enhance flavor and aroma, and this garlic powder is the best for that. I would rather pay a little more to accomplish the desired results in dishes that I make. I like that Amazon is offering this garlic and saving me a trip to the store. I bought shaker bottles from Amazon, and filled one with this garlic powder. The rest of it went into the freezer to keep it fresher for longer.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRed Quinoa, 25 Lb Bag\nReview:\nFor the last couple of years, we have been using the pearl, or white, quinoa for its health value because reviews have described the flavor of red quinoa as being strong. I mistakenly assumed that strong would not be good. More recently, I tried a couple of small bags of the red quinoa to see if we liked it. All I can say is \"Wow\". The difference is like night and day. The white quinoa has little flavor and needs additives to have any at all. When eating it, it doesn't stay together at all. All of the little, teensy pieces can be difficult to keep together without some sort of sauce or a spoon. In contrast, the red quinoa, has a crunchy texture, and a nutty flavor. Granted, I still add garlic and onion powders in addition to other spices when I cook it, but we love the texture and the color. I did rinse this quinoa a couple of times before soaking just to make sure there weren't any hulls or dust in it. I think it's better to do this than take a chance it has been cleaned enough. I did find it to be clean, and little, if anything, rinsed out of it. I would highly recommend this quinoa to anyone that has not yet tried the red variety and to those that have. I still also use the pearl quinoa as an additive for pot roast, stews, and other things that I only want the nutritive value without the crunch, but the red variety is our alternative to rice or potatoes.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Bulk Whole Certified Organic Mustard Seed, Brown, 1 lb\nReview:\nI bought both this mustard seed and the yellow mustard seed. The brown mustard seed is much harder to find locally. I grind this seed with the yellow mustard seed to make homemade Dijon mustard. Making homemade mustard is so easy, and doesn't compare to anything you would buy in the store. My recipe for Dijon mustard is:\nIngredients:\n* 1/2 cup dry white wine\n* 1/2 cup white wine vinegar\n* 1/4 cup brown mustard seeds (about 1 1/2 oz.)\n* 1/4 cup yellow mustard seeds (about 1 1/2 oz.)\n* 3 garlic cloves, minced\n* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt\nDirections:\n1. Combine all ingredients in a small glass bowl, stir and cover tightly. Let sit at room temperature for 2 days.\n2. Transfer to a blender and blend until the desired consistency. Keep in mind that it's not possible for this mustard to reach a completely smooth consistency. Store tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.\n\nThis mustard seems to increase potency as it is stored. It tastes more like a horseradish mustard over time.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAnthony's Organic White Mulberries, Sun Dried (12oz)\nReview:\nI have never had mulberries before. So I wasn't sure what to expect. After doing a little research on them, I found that they are considered to be a Superfood. They are a good source of resveratrol, vitamins C and K, calcium, and iron to name a few. These white mulberries are really quite good. They have a taste and texture similar to raisins. As you can see in my picture, they are uniform in size, and all of a similar color. These berries are very good, and healthy, for snacking, and would also be good in smoothies as you might use goji berries. We will also use them in my 96 year old mother's morning oatmeal. As an added benefit, these white mulberries are certified organic and non-GMO. For a 12 oz. bag, they are also quite reasonable. I plan to keep these in stock as I do goji berries.\n\nI received these mulberries at a discount or for free for my honest, unbiased evaluation and review. All of my reviews are nothing less than honest as I rely heavily on customer product reviews for my own purchases.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Co-op Organic Bay Leaf, Whole, 1 Pound Bulk Bag\nReview:\nPrior to getting the Frontier Bay Leaves, I had always bought the large jars from the store. The sizes of the leaves were very inconsistent, and many of them were broken. This sometimes made it difficult to find and remove them all from the finished dish. The Frontier bay leaves are all very large, and the aroma is amazing. Granted the bag is large, but I keep them in my freezer to preserve freshness, and put a few at a time in the old bay leaf jar so that they are handy. I find it interesting that after cooking in a long cooking recipe, they don't break easily. They feel more like a leathery leaf and are easily removed from the food.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLa Tourangelle Roasted Almond Oil, 16.9-Ounce Unit (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nIn the last couple of years, I have done a lot of research on healthy food products and healthy eating. So I have gotten away from using the various vegetable oils, and had been using primairly olive oil. When I found this product and some of the other nut oils, I now sometimes use them for the health benefits. I have been using this almond oil for a Ceasar dressing that calls for vegetable oil and it works great. Some of the nut oils can be used for frying and others are better for salad dressings and cold recipes. Some seem to feel that the nut oils add flavor, but this is not my experience. I really haven't noticed any difference in flavor, but the health benefits of nut oils are more than enough to convert recipes calling for vegetable oils.\n\nSome of the nut oils are also supposed to be good for the skin and hair. I have tried almond and macadamia oils on my face at night, and the skin does absorb it. I tried mac oil on my hair once, but wouldn't do it again. My hair was pretty well slicked down, and I washed the oil out immediately. For salads and any cooking that doesn't use high heat, I would highly recommend this almond oil for its health benefits.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['use', 'salt', 'oils', 'used', 'oil', 'also', 'flavor', 'mustard', 'quinoa', 'much']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\n Grocery &amp; Gourmet Food\" />\nReview:\nI understand why this wasn't available in the US for awhile.

The truth is that the regular peanut butter has a richer taste, one in which the peanutty flavor comes through more distinctly.

Also, each 14.2 oz. package contains two pouches, which is great if you just want to make a small quantity of noodles at one time.

I've also used it as one of the ingredients in my homemade granola, and I find that it adds a bit of extra body to the final product.

I'm on a diet emphasizing cutting out as much sugar as possible and peanuts fit the bill with less than one gram per serving.. By the way, my bag is only 12 ounces and is branded with the \"San Diego Padres Baseball Club\" imprinted on the label. Probably a local variant. Same salted in the shell nuts. Different size bag. Same Hampton Farms logo. Maybe every city large enough to have a baseball club has it's own variant. Interesting way to sell more nuts, I suppose. In any case, they're quite good nuts. Mine seemed a little stale (not a problem) and I would have preferred them to be a little saltier. My last bag of peanuts was a five-pound bag of Hoodies that was stale to the point of inedible. These are good. I'll buy them again.\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCrunchmaster Artisan Four Cheese Rice Cracker, 3.5-Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI picked up these Crunchmaster Rice (Artisan Four Cheese) Crackers at a nearby Costco Store. They looked good, and a lady gave me one to taste. They were good. Into the cart went a six package box. They're the same as these, only packed together in a slightly different way.\n\nThe crackers are excellent. They're real crunchy, way moreso than most crackers and they have the faint taste and smell of cheese. They're lightly salted and have a very low fat content. I enjoy them by themselves as snacks, or I eat them with smoked oysters or sardines as a light lunch. Or, I have them with a variety of spreads. They're pretty versatile, and delicious I should add.\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNongShim Bowl Noodle Soup, Spicy Chicken, 3.03 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis afternoon I had a Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup of the Spicy Chicken variety. It's a quick lunch (four minutes) and quite tasty. My only gripes would be that it's too high in sodium, a complaint shared by almost all noodle bowls, and that it doesn't have enough protein for a good meal. I can easily add the latter. I also had a big Delicious Apple to supply something fresh and something with a lot of fiber. Altogether, the combination made a good lunch, and it was quick and easy.\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAmy's Organic Chili, Medium Black Bean, 14.7 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nSome time ago, I tried the Amy's Spicy Organic Chili and liked it very much. So, when I was back at the nearby Fresh and Easy store and looking over the chili, I spotted the Amy's Medium Organic Chili. Into the cart a can went. Well, I like this one too and it's actually a bit zesty. I thought I'd add some Frank's Hot Sauce if it wasn't tasty enough, but it turned out that there was no need. This is good stuff. It's meatless, but has beans, soybeans and tofu so the protein content is actually fairly high but the fat content is rather low. If I had any criticism, i night be that the sodium content is too high. But, all in all, it's a rather good chili. Given the choice, I think I'd slightly prefer the spicy variety.\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAmy's Organic Chili, Medium Black Bean, 14.7 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nMy nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market carries a lot of gourmet and health-related items and I like to try them. One I picked up recently was Amy's Organic Chili. I bought both the regular and the spicy varieties and I'm reviewing the spicy one here. It's quite good for a canned chili. I'd say it's at least as good as any other canned brand I've ever tried. Plus it's fairly low in fat and seems to lack that oily topping I associate with canned chili. I't's a little higher in sodium than I'd like, but not by much. The taste is quite good. It's somewhat zesty but I'd rate the spicyness as mild. The meat is ground and occurs as tittle interspersed grains rather than larger chunks. Of course, it's organic. I've always liked chili and this is a good one that I can keep stashed in my pantry. Amy's is a good brand and I'm very satisfied.\n\nGsry Peterson\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDavid Seeds Pumpkin Seeds, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nIf you're ever looking for a light snack to accompany watching television, a ball game or something like that, try David Pumpkin Seeds. They're lightly roasted, lightly salted and all natural. And they're delicious!\n\nSome people eat the entire seed, but I only eat the kernels. Thus, I have to crack each seed, extract the kernel and dispose of the hulls. This process can be somewhat time consuming, but like everything else, you get better and better with practice. Still, some people would regard this as a negative, but I would regard it as a positive. I can sometimes spend all evening consuming a delicious snack and watching TV and consume less than a single serving which amounts to 280 calories. Plus, seeds and nuts carry a heavy caloric load in general, to be sure, but they also carry a lot of vitamins, minerals, unsaturated vegetable fat and fiber. They may have calories, but they aren't empty calories! I worry a little about the salt content, but the David seeds are only lightly salted and I don't consume the entire seed.\n\nThese David Pumpkin Seeds are a fine light snack. Prepare to get addicted. I'll bet you can't eat just one, or one pack. They can be a little hard to find, but finding large quantities online is easy. Good snacking!\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSea's Gift Korean Seaweed Snack (Kim Nori), Roasted &amp; Sea Salted, 0.17-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nI'll try almost anything once.

The smacks are thin little wafers and there must be about a dozen in a serving. They're strange tasting and slightly salty, but by the end of the serving I was enjoying them. They're like eating little pieces of flavored cellophane that dissolve in your mouth. In any case, it was an interesting experiment. I'll buy more.

I've never had anything aloe before and I was curious. Well, it's quite good. I'd say it tastes like a mild iced tea with something of a fresh, very-light minty flavor and is ever so slightly sweet. All the ingredients are certified organic. It's produced right here in California, only about a hundred miles away, in fact. Supposedly it has digestive, immune and skin benefits, and I certainly can't vouch for that after having only one bottle. But, I like it. Nice taste. Goes  down easy.

Then, occasionally, my taste buds change direction to the point of craving the aforementioned \"repulsion.\"  The first time I can remember this phenomenon was with Kombucha.  I hated the vinegary bite, but kept drinking the beverage because of its health benefits.  Now, I have to ration the stuff to protect my wallet.  More recently, I fell into the same trap with this mayo.\n\nOn first try, I felt like the product simply tasted \"wrong.\"  I disliked it, but I'm thrifty; I didn't toss it in the trash.  By the 3rd or 4th try, my brain had accepted that this tasted different.  I began to appreciate the merits the flavor does have.  The texture is different, too.  Most mayonnaise seems more whipped (with air in it).  This is smoother and creamier.  Actually, more like the food prep mayo I used to use when I worked in a deli.\n\nI guess another comparison would be with orange drinks.

They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case.

Lately I have been enjoying different flavored teas and herb teas.  This tea has a mildly sweat citrus flavor that I enjoy with a hint of a green tea flavor.\n\nAs I have moved from black teas to flavored teas and herb teas I have learned that the name of a product and the box cover does not always represent the flavor.  In this case it does a good job.\n\nI get a sweet taste that I assume comes from the jasmine and a slight tangy sweet taste from the citrus. I also get a hint of a green tea flavor as well.  The flavors are mild but I have found this to be the case in most teas like this. I actually was concerned the Jasmine might make this too sweet but thankfully it was not. I wish the citrus was a bit stronger but overall this is a good tea.\n\nI do like that fact that Lipton cares about the environment and people who work to cultivate tea and lists on the back of the box that the tea is \"Rainforest Alliance Certified.\"  I did a search on the web and this means that farms that are \"Rainforest Alliance Certified\" meet set criteria when it comes to protecting the environment and ensuring employees on the farms are paid a decent wage and have good working conditions. I am neither an expert on the environment nor wage and work criteria but this seems to be a good thing and I feel better drinking a tea like this knowing workers were treated decently and thought was given to protecting the environment.\n\nI gave this four stars because I thought the citrus flavor could have been a bit stronger but this is still a good tasting tea.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

With some Chai's one spice predominates in an unpleasant way- that is not the case in my opinion with this chai.  The packages are easy to open, and most of the time the threads are well attached- though I did get one box two deliveries ago in which their seemed to be a defect, and the strings that attached the little paper dipper all came off.

This candy bar is one of my favorite coconut treats.  It is not disgustingly sweet, rather it has a delicate coconut flavor.  Normally, I dislike white chocolate but with the coconut, this candy bar is amazing.  The consistency and intensity of the bar is not like a mounds bar.  This is an actual candy bar with no filling.  The coconut flavor is melded with the chocolate.  The bar is fairly large.  I typically take three to four days to eat one bar - the restraint is hard, but at 240 calories a serving restraint is necessary.  Flecks of this bar are great on ice cream but also in thicker, warmer beverages.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNature's Path Organic Chewy Granola Bars, Sunny Hemp Plus, 7.4 Ounce Box (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI love this bar and that is probably because I love any treat that combines peanuts and chocolate.  I don't consider this a health bar.  This has a good amount of sugar and a good amount of fat.  I eat them because they are a great cheat treat.  When I eat well all day, I look forward to this soft but chewy bar that has real peanuts and what seems to be real chocolate (I detest bars that proclaim to have real chocolate but instead incorporate a fake chocolaty substance).\n\nWhat I like about this bar:\n1) The taste - Wow! For a granola bar the taste is phenomenal. The picture on the box does not lie.  You can see peanuts and oats and the chocolate topping tastes awesome.  The texture of the oats/nuts melds well with the oats and nuts.\n\n2) Portable and easy to pack - If you try to stay aware of your daily calorie intake, it is always great to have easy to carry snacks with their calories clearly labeled. Who has time to count out the exact number of pretzels that comprise 150 calories? That is part of the appeal of a granola bar. You've got a 150 calorie food item that can be placed in a purse or coat pocket and you are out the door.\n\n3) The company has made a conscious effort to reduce packaging in order to reduce impact on the environment.  The box is made of 100% recycled materials.\n\nWhat is questionable about this bar:\n1) This is a snack/treat bar and nothing else - This is not a healthful nutrition bar. The product packaging does not necessarily say this is healthful. It does use the words \"organic goodness\" and boasts \"9 grams of whole grains\". These notations may make some think this is a really healthy treat. But it's not. The bar has low fiber (2g) and pretty high sugar for a 150 calorie bar (11 grams).\n\n2)If you use snacks to hold you over, you probably should find a snack with at least 4 grams of fiber. The 2 gram bar is not going to tide you over very long.\n\nIf you feed these to your kids, there is a good likelihood they will like them. They are pretty sweet.  But again with the sugar, what else are you giving your kids during the day? Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 3/4 teaspoons in this bar. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this bar may not be worth it to you. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end.\n\nSummary:\nNature's Path has created a very tasty granola bar with quality ingredients. Props to the company for not saying this was a health or nutrition bar on the box. I am reviewing this as a treat bar and as a treat, it is a delicious option. If it were being reviewed for health, I would not be able to give it four stars as it has high sugar, high fat and low fiber.  Don't expect it to hold you over for hours but do expect it to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nThese granola bars are made in the United States.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBanana Nut Cheerios Cereal, 10.9 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI love plain cheerios but sometimes a little cheerio diversity is called for.  The banana nut flavor is not overly sweet and there is a distinctive banana taste, almost a slightly burnt banana taste.  I love pairing a bowl of these cheerios with so delicious coconut milk and sliced banana pieces.  The combination of the three easily keep me satiated from breakfast until lunch.  I occasionally mix this banana nut flavor with chocolate cheerios for an even sweeter, exceptional treat.\n\nWhile I do not find the banana nut flavor to be overly sweet, one should not overlook that sugar is the second ingredient for this food and, the sugar content is relatively high -- especially for frequent use by children.  Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 1/4 teaspoons in a single 3/4 cup serving of banana nut cheerios. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this cereal may be high for frequent consumption. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end. If you child is getting 2 and 1/4 teaspoons with this cereal, your child has consumed a fair amount of sugar for the morning.\n\nWhen paired with fresh bananas, this cereal can be filling but if limiting sugar for your kids (or your own meals), you might want to use sparingly.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWolfgang Puck Organic Signature Butternut Squash Soup, 14.5 oz. (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis is a good soup -- there is no doubt.  The corn, carrots and potatoes are plentiful (no skimping on ingredients in the cans I've tried).  Together, the ingredients make a thick and hearty soup that is perfect for a cold winter day.  I did not feel the need to add salt -- the corn is not bland in flavor and the soup already has a lot of sodium. Moreover, I felt no need to add crackers.  The soup can hold its own.\n\nSome posters have noted that this soup has a high level of fat.  It does -- 13g per one cup serving.  Fat, of course, is not bad in moderation.  In my quest for the perfect corn soup, however, I have found an alternative option. It is worth noting here for those who may have particular dietary considerations.  Imagine foods makes an organic sweet corn soup that has 3g of fat per 1 cup serving. The soup comes in a boxed container and is just a corn base.  There are no special flavorings. As a base, it is a good corn soup but when you add several cups of frozen corn kernels (and cooked potatoes if you have the time and desire), you can have a soup just as hearty and delicious as Wolfgang Pucks but with less fat and calories.  This option does require about five minutes more of your time (if only adding frozen corn).  Wolfgang Puck's soup is quick -- in two minutes you have a steaming bowl of great corn soup and you don't have to wait for kernels to thaw.\n\nIf you are not looking closely at fat (or eat fat it in moderation) and want something quick, this soup is great.  If you are looking for a healthy alternative, I would take a little more time and build a hearty soup using the organic sweet corn soup from Imagine.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPacific Natural Foods All Natural Chipotle Sweet Potato Soup, 17 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nFirst, I typically love products produced by Pacific Natural Foods. This was not a winner in my book. The smell was the first thing that turned me off. I had to wait five minutes to even try the soup because it smelled so awful. When I tasted it, the spices used were overpowering and it was difficult to taste any sweet potato. What I could taste reminded me of curry and it seems like the soup could be married well with rice. Unfortunately as the soup is now, it would be too runny to pour over rice. I suppose a person could add some sweet potato and regular potatoes to make it thicker. I drowned the soup with saltines and it was edible but not enjoyable. I'm giving it two stars because I think with modifications it could be used for different non-soup purposes. Better luck next time Pacific.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nArtisana Macadamia/Cashew Butter (100% Organic), 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nAfter trying Artisana's Cacao Bliss, I wanted to sample some of the manufacturer's other products.  I really enjoy macademia nuts and thought the Macadamia with Cashews butter would be a good product to try.  This product is made with just two ingredients -- macadamias and cashews -- and I can say that this product demonstrates what a healthy, good for you food should taste like.\n\nUnlike Cacao Bliss, which is a solid product at room temperature, the macadamia cashew butter is easily retrieved from the container.  There was some oil separation but after a little stirring, one can take a butter knife and quickly spread the substance on a piece of toast or apple slices; the product is incredibly smooth out of the jar.  When looking at the butter, you will see little pieces of nuts which makes this product product have some texture.  This macadamia cashew butter is not as chunky as most chunky peanut butters; the chunks in this product are much finer.  I found the flavor to be very much influenced by the raw cashews and actually considered my jar to be more of a cashew butter than a macadamia butter.\n\nIt is recommended that this product be refrigerated for a longer life.\n\nWhile not noted explicitly on the product's label, I could see nothing that would contradict my belief that this is a vegan product.  There is no milk, honey, eggs or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product. According to the product packaging, this product is \"made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO's.\"\n\nThis is my second good experience with Artisana products.  For holiday gift giving, I'm definitely going to be packaging several of Artisana's products in gift baskets.  They are tasty, natural and unique.\n\nA note on another place to buy this product, iherb.com. I turn to iherb with frequency to purchase Artisana products.  The site has free shipping over a certain threshold and offers thousands upon thousands of natural and organic food products. If interested in trying iherb, you can use my code LEK375 for a five or ten dollar discount depending on order size.\n\nThis product is made in the United States\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCrystal Light Drink Mix - MARGARITA, 1.62 oz.

In terms of flavor, I find this acceptable.  It tastes like a very mild margarita (without alcohol).  It even smells like a margarita.  While I think Crystal Light has done a good job imitating a margarita, it is not my favorite Crystal Light product.\n\nIf you live near a Meijer, you can buy a five pack canister of the Margarita drink mix (as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Mocktails-Appletini-1-69-Ounce-Pack-of-4/dp/B005A1LGIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini, 1.69-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Moctails-Mojito-1-41-Ounce-Pack-of-4/dp/B005A1LINC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>) for about 2.79.\n\nIf you recycle your plastics, be aware that Crystal Light sells its product in a #5 container. Unless you live in a relatively progressive place, #5 plastics are typically very difficult to recycle. Whole Foods engages in a recycling initiative to collect #5 plastics but if you don't live near one and you care about recycling, these can be a challenging item to deal with.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a beverage that I would drink again but I don't know if I would purchase it if some of my other Crystal Light favorites were available like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Sunrise-Ruby-Red-Grapefruit-3-4-Ounce-Unit-Pack-of-6/dp/B001E53TMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Sunrise Ruby Red Grapefruit, 3.4-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Moctails-Mojito-1-41-Ounce-Pack-of-4/dp/B005A1LINC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Organic Chips, Coconut, 1 Pound, 16 Ounce\nReview:\nI, too, was thrown off by the name of this product.  When I saw the words \"coconut chips\", I envisioned something like baking chips that were coconut flavored and could be used in the place of chocolate chips.  Not so.  These flakes are just larger versions of regular shredded coconut but not nearly as sweet.  They have great utility in the kitchen.  Here are some things I have used them for:\n1.  Fruit salad with coconut flakes - Cut your favorite fruit (strawberries, mangoes, blueberries, etc) and add some coconut chips, a drizzle of agave or honey, and some walnuts.  Yum!\n\n2.  Vegan \"bacon\" bites:  You can toss these coconut chips with liquid smoke and other spices to create vegan bacon bites for salads.  There are many recipes online.  Once the coconut chips are tossed with the various flavorings, the chips are baked for a bit to become crisp.  The bites are a great substitute for croutons.\n\n3. Coconut no-bake cookies:  If you want to avoid tedious baking, cookies that can be whipped up without the assistance of an oven are always wonderful.  Instead of peanut butter or chocolate no-bake cookies, try a coconut no-bake cookie.\n\n4. Coconut chips:  While the pieces of this product are small, I have made some cinnamon coconut chips that are perfect for snacking.  Simply toss chips with cinnamon, salt, and oil.  Spread the pieces out on a pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for several minutes until crispy.  It is pretty much the same process as the vegan bacon bites mentioned in #2 save with different toppings.\n\nGive this product a try!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLuna Bars, Chocolate Peppermint Stick, 1.69-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)\nReview:\nOf all of the Luna Bar flavors, the Chocolate Peppermint Stick is my favorite.  It is very minty and easily chewable.  You don't have to worry about breaking a tooth when you try to eat it.  The bar is dipped in peppermint on one side; the overall chocolate and peppermint is very reminiscent of a peppermint patty.  If I had not looked at the wrapper, I would be able to say this was meant to be a peppermint bar (try doing that with other protein/meal replacement/nutrition bars that claim to be peanut butter flavored or brownie flavored and they taste nothing like their inspiration.)  There is also no vitamin taste.\n\nOverall, the bar is pretty filling and could hold you over between meals.  As it has less than 200 calories, it can be classified as a snack.  I like to eat one of these bars after dinner as a treat and also keep them in my office when I can't leave for lunch.\n\nIn sum, if you like chocolate and peppermint, try this bar.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCrystal Light Drink Mix, Lemon Iced Tea, Pitcher Packets, 4 Count (Pack of 4 Canisters)\nReview:\nMy husband and I drink a good amount of Crystal Light powdered beverages. I was initially very leery of purchasing this particular flavor.  The combination, particularly for a powder based beverage, sounded like a disaster in the making.  In the end, I can say that it was better than expected.  In terms of flavor, I think a kid (or the kid at heart) would enjoy this more than an adult.\n\nSome notes on flavor, color, and packaging:\n\nFlavor:  Compared to other Crystal Light beverages, the flavor of strawberry orange banana is actually quite complex.  You can taste each of those flavors in the beverage.  While a fine combination of flavors, something about it screams \"kid\".  It is just not what I would serve to a fellow adult on a hot day.\n\nColor: Like many of the flavors in the Crystal Light Light, the Strawberry Orange Banana is a rather vibrant color once mixed; it is a deep pink color.  It looks very artificial (which, admittedly, this beverage is).  If color is important to you, Crystal Light does have some subtlety colored options.  For example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Moctails-Mojito-1-41-Ounce-Pack-of-4/dp/B005A1LINC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;looks like cloudy water but tastes like mint and lime.\n\nPackaging: One negative with all of the Crystal Light products relates to packaging. First, the container is a #5 plastic. Unless you live in a relatively progressive place, #5 plastics are typically very difficult to recycle. I know Whole Foods engages in a recycling initiative to collect #5 plastics but if you don't live near one and you care about recycling, these can be a challenging item to deal with. Additionally, if you like Crystal Light, it can be very easy to go through these containers quickly. Some Crystal Light flavors, like the strawberry orange banana, have six packets and others have five. The container could hold more flavor packets, which would reduce the overall number of containers that the user has to dispose of.\n\nOverall, a fine beverage that is encased in packaging that is not very green. If you are looking for a more adult option, I would suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Moctails-Mojito-1-41-Ounce-Pack-of-4/dp/B005A1LINC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>,<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Ruby-Red-Grapefruit-Drink-Mix-10-Quart-3-4-Ounce-Packages-Pack-of-4/dp/B003DNL9RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink Mix (10-Quart), 3.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Pink-Lemonade-Drink-Mix-8-Quart-1-9-Ounce-Canisters-Pack-of-4/dp/B003DNL9OC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Pink Lemonade Drink Mix (8-Quart), 1.9-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a>.\n\n3.5 - 4 stars\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['product', 'tea', 'chocolate', 'flavor', 'like', 'bar', 'would', 'good', 'one', 'sugar']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nOlive Garden Signature Italian Salad Dressing, 16 Ounce\nReview:\nWas looking forward to this, but it was awful..Strong sour taste...Threw it out..\nRating:\n1.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Unfortunately, the flavor was extremely disappointing.  First of all, the cookie part didn't really taste like anything.  Red velvet, like Devil's food, is a type of CHOCOLATE, and there was very little chocolate flavor in these cookies.  Next, the filling was describe on the package as \"cream cheese flavored creme.\"  It tasted nothing at all like the unique flavor of sweetened cream cheese, which is tangy without being overly sweet; instead, this filling was just a super-sweet cream.  Honestly if I was going to splurge on something, I wish I had just purchased regular Oreos, because these were not worth it at all.  I hope my co-workers like them, because they will be getting the leftovers.  Although they are edible as a sweet, cream-filled store-bought cookie, I certainly don't recommend these as a red velvet treat.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S Nuggets Holiday Chocolate Candy, Milk Chocolate w/Toffee &amp; Almonds, 60 Ounce Bulk Bag\nReview:\nI am usually someone who prefers dark chocolate--I like the richness of the dark chocolate, and I find some milk chocolates too artificial tasting.  This Hershey variety is definitely an exception.  It is labelled \"Extra Creamy\" milk chocolate, and it's true--although sweeter than dark chocolate, these nuggets are definitely more creamy than the standard milk chocolate.  The little toffee bits--along with the crushed almonds--add a delicious bit of extra sweetness and crunch.\n\nFour of these little nuggets makes a single serving, which is a reasonable amount of calories at 200, but a bit high in fat, carbs, and sugar for me (13g, 21g, and 20g, respectively).  So, I just eat two nuggets at a time for a yummy little 100 calorie treat.  If you enjoy a toffee (or caramel, since I think it's quite similar) flavor, I would definitley recommend these nuggets and this generous 60-ounce bag.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nZonePerfect Nutrition Snack Bars, Chocolate Almond Raisin. 1.76 oz, (12 Count)\nReview:\nI am always looking for nutrition snack bars that will help me refuel after workouts, curb between meal hunger pangs, and hopefully, taste great, too!  I was encourged by the nutritional profile of the Zone Perfect bar, and I decided to give the Fudge Graham variety a try.  This bar comes in at 210 calories, with 7 grams of fat (4 saturated, 0 trans), 21 grams carbs, 1 gram fiber, and an excellent 16 grams protein.  The Fudge Gramam flavor has a nice texture--sort of like a Rice Crispie treat--and is covered in a fudge coating, but this had a bit of an artificial taste to me.  In addition, I didn't detect any graham flavor, which I found disappointing.  The bar did taste good, but I've also had better (the Pria Complete Peanut Butter Crunch are really delicious!), and I would've liked to see more fiber as well.  Overall, this is not a bad choice, but keep in mind that there may be better options available.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nPressed by KIND Fruit Bars, Mango Apple Chia, No Sugar Added, Gluten Free, 1.2oz, 12 Count\nReview:\nI thought these bars would be a good way to help me get in more fruit and vegetable servings--I like pineapple, bananas, kale, and spinach, so win-win, right?  Well, in reality, not so much.  The first thing that you notice upon opening these bars is that not only do they look like molded spinach, but also they SMELL very strongly of spinach, too.  Now, as I said, I LIKE spinach, and normally, I don't mind the scent of it at all.  However, it is much different in bar form!  The bar does taste significantly fruity, so if I can sort of hold my breath and get past the smell, I can manage to eat it, although obviously, this is not ideal.  The other issue I have with these bars is that the spinach/kale gets stuck between your teeth VERY easily, even worse than eating the fresh version of this items.  So in the end, these bars are really NOT worth it to me, which is too bad, as they could have been a nutritious, convenient snack.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nNature Valley Chewy Granola Bars, Vanilla Yogurt, 1.2 oz, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI wasn't sure if I would like these granola bars; although I like yogurt, I didn't really like the idea of a yogurt coating.  However, my niece's love of the bars encouraged me to try them for myself, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they are delicious!  The granola part is sweet and chewy, and the additional sweetness of the yogurt is a perfect compliment.  I've tried all the flavors but like the vanilla the best, as the others were a bit TOO sweet for my liking.  If you are a fan of granola bars and yogurt, you are likely to enjoy this winning combination.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar, Orange Cranberry, 1.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI was excited to try this product, as I usually have bars for breakfast, but it is getting harder to find ones that have good nutritional profiles in breakfast-appropriate (i.e., non-chocolate) flavors.  I love cranberry, so this bar seemed nearly perfect, especially given that I checked out the nutritional content prior to ordering.  At 4 grams, the amount of protein was a bit low for my liking, but the bar made up for this by being low in both sugar (12 grams) and saturated fat (1 gram) while being very high in fiber (7 grams).\n\nThe texture of this bar is the first thing that struck me as a bit odd.  Although it is moist (i.e., as opposed to hard and crunchy), it is not chewy; in fact, it breaks apart easily and is a bit on the crumbly side.  (I suppose it is somewhat similar to a a CLIF brand bar.)  The taste, however, was quite disappointing:  rather than the tart taste of cranberry or the sweetness of orange, I detected only a bitter flavor.  It tasted almost as if the bar had been flavored with the bitter rind of the orange.  There did seem to be little fruit pieces in the bar that may have been cranberry, but unfortunately, the unpleasant bitterness overpowered everything else.\n\nI thought the first bar that I tried was just okay, but the second one seemed worse, and now I'm afraid I might have to toss the whole box (which I HATE to do--I hate being wasteful, so I might try dipping them in yogurt or something just to get through them).  Perhaps another flavor by this brand would be better, but unfortunately, I can't recommend these.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Honey Roasted Peanuts, Golden Roast, 14 oz\nReview:\nI consider nuts one of the most healthy things you can eat--I keep them on hand for snacks, salads, meal throw-ins, whatever!  I typically buy store brand unsalted peanuts, so I was interested to see how these low-salt peanuts from Fisher would compare.  The combination of dry roasting and sea salt gives these nuts an almost seasoned taste--they are delicious!

In addition, I tend to avoid protein bars covered in chocolate, as I have found that the chocolate often tastes quite artificial.  However, I received a free sample of this Chocolate Dipped Coconut bar, so I gave it a try.\n\nI am pleased to report that this bar was delicious!  The chocolate/coconut blend is quite reminiscent of the flavor of a Mounds chocolate bar and not artificial tasting at all--rather, it was rich and chewy, with no unpleasant aftertaste.  In addition, the nutrition profile of this bar is comparable to other Luna bars:  190 calories, 7 grams fat (a bit high, but only 3.5 grams saturated, and no trans fats), 25 grams total carbs, including 3 grams fiber and only 11 grams of sugar, and 9 grams of protein.  Furthermore, the bar is fortified with various vitamins and minerals, from 35% of daily recommendation for Calcium to good amounts of most of the B vitamins.\n\nThis is definitely a bar that I would purchase on my own--highly recommended!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Mixed Nuts with Peanuts, Stand-Up Bag, Gluten Free, 5.5 oz\nReview:\nThis mixed nuts product definitely lives up to the name, with a nice distribution of cashews, almonds, walnuts, and brazil nuts.  If anything, I found that there were more of the former two, which worked out perfectly for me, as I especially love cashews and almonds!  I would have preferred plain roasted nuts without the added oil and salt, but still, this is a good product overall.  I would recommend this mixed nut collection, although the price seems a bit high to me as compared to similar offerings by other brands.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Chef's Naturals Slivered Almonds, No Preservatives, Non-GMO, 2 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI love keeping sliced/chopped nuts around, as I think they are one of the most nutritious foods available--not only are they a natural plant product, but also they are packed with protein and healthy fats!  This HUGE bag of Fisher Natural Sliced Almonds provides you with plenty of bang for your buck.  The stand-up bag is resealable, which is very convenient.  The almonds are delicious eaten straight out of the bag or tossed on salads and other dishes.  I also toasted them in the oven--yum, smells like popcorn and tastes even better!

The walnuts, almonds, pistachios, and cranberries all taste very fresh. The package that I received in January expires in November of the same year. Each packet holds 1 ounce of snacks and it's just enough to hit the spot as a snack. Very lightly salted with sea salt, each packet contains just 15mg of sodium.\n\nI immediately noticed that the contents of each packet are not consistent with each other. Every package contains at least one piece of the variety. The amount of pistachios and almonds varies widely. In half of the 8 packets, there was only 1 pistachio. Most of the remaining packets had 2 pistachios, although one package had 5 of the little green nuts. Almonds also varied from 2 to 5 nuts. Some packages had a higher ratio of cranberries to nuts. I attached 2 images showing 2 different opened packages.\n\nThe cranberries are sweetened with sugar, not HFCS, and also contain a small amount of expeller pressed sunflower oil to keep them soft. There is additional oil added to the mixture, but I'm not sure why. Maybe to keep the nuts from drying out? Sunflower oil is not a good source of ALA, containing only 1% ALA. Regardless, there isn't enough to make my hands feel too oily.\n\nEach package contains about half of your daily recommended amount of alpha linolenic acid (ALA) not to be confused with the other ALA, alpha lipoic acid. This Omega 3 fatty acid is found in nuts and other plant foods.\n\nOverall, I really like this snack! It's satisfying and tastes great, and I know that I'm not eating something I shouldn't.

It does contain sugar, but the 4 grams of sugar per serving is low compared to other granola brands.  I also appreciate that this is not a hard granola, so it's easy to eat.  It's just crispy enough so that it holds up under milk.  I like it with Almond Breeze brand coconut milk.

These are very different in texture, but I really did enjoy them. This is the first time that I've tasted a flavored kale chip, and I love them. I brought the package to work and we shared it, and everyone that tried these kool ranch kale chips liked them, even Miss Picky. The bag didn't last long! They were crispy and tasty, and were not too salty. They only contain 220mg sodium per serving (half a bag) which surprised me since similar products usually contain more. The serving contains 140 calories and 6 grams of protein. Kale is loaded with vitamins, so it's a sneaky way to slip in some nutrients.  Although I loved the flavor, I was less than enthused about the clumps of kale chips that were stuck together due to the seasoning. They were tasty, but it was easy to get greedy with the clumps and leave the little bits and pieces for my coworkers to taste. The next time I get these kale chips, I'll try adding the leftover crumbs to a salad to add flavor to my lunch. And there will be a next time! I'll still make plain kale chips from scratch, but I can't make flavored chips to taste like this.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nColavita Instant Polenta Cornmeal, 16 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis polenta is delicious! It really does cook up properly in just 5 minutes. It has good flavor and the texture is good. I always cook it with a little less water, then pour it into a pan to make polenta squares. I can grill them or saute in a pan. They freeze well, so I can pull out just enough for dinner. This was my first experience with a quick cooking polenta. I have always taken the time to make old fashioned polenta, and it is worth the effort. But for an instant product, the Colavita polenta works out very well.\n\nSomeone else mentioned that this polenta is non-GMO, but the box didn't reflect that. I contacted the company and verified that it is indeed non-GMO, which makes it an even better choice for many people.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRishi Tea Organic Black Tea, Earl Grey Loose Tea, 3.3-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nEarl Grey Tea can be overwhelming. Generally, when an Earl Grey calls itself \"Bold\", they aren't joking. Personally, if there is too much bergamot oil in the tea, it is too overpowering for me to drink. I like to drink an aromatic tea, not a cup of perfume. The Rishi Earl Grey tea is described as \"bold and sweetly smooth with an enlivening aroma of bergamot citrus.\" I think that sums it up very well. I was a little concerned when I popped the lid on the tin, as the scent was very powerful.  However, it is a pleasant smelling tea that does not overwhelm me when the cup reaches the mouth. I can taste a high quality, rich black tea with sweet and lightly citrus tones.\n\nI also feel good about drinking this tea because it is a Fair Trade Certified tea that is shade grown from heirloom tea trees. It's organic as well as Kosher. Rishi also says this tea can be steeped multiple times, so this tea is also very economical. I'll definitely be trying more Rishi teas.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Organic Coconut Flour, 4 Pound\nReview:\nI really enjoy Nutiva coconut flour. It always smells fresh and it tastes wonderful.  I had been buying it in 3 pound bags that were clear plastic and did not zip close. I had to transfer them to containers that blocked the light. I like the new package since it blocks light and helps keep it fresh. The zipper was a little tricky to close, but it works.  I mainly use this coconut flour in morning smoothies to add texture and a big boost of fiber. I've used other brands that had a finer texture, but this one is fine for my purposes and it's often more affordable than others. It can be used in baking if you use it as a substitute for a small amount of the grain flour in your recipe, but it doesn't stand alone as a replacement. I've bought this several times and hope to continue using it in the future.  FYI the bag I just received has an expiration date of one year away.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Chef's Naturals Slivered Almonds, No Preservatives, Non-GMO, 2 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese almonds are very tasty. They have a natural sweetness to them and the almond flavor really comes through, so they seem very fresh to me. The condition of the almonds is excellent, the bag didn't contain broken nuts. They are crunchy, but not dried out, so they chew easily. I've tasted many almonds that didn't have much flavor to them. Not the case with this bag of Fisher almonds! I like them a lot. I won't rate based on the price, since the price can fluctuate widely online. Plus these nuts are also sold in local stores. I tried to find out if these almonds are steam pasteurized or gassed, but didn't have any luck. If I find out, I'll update this review since that matters to some consumers. Overall, these are good nuts.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLotus Foods Gourmet Organic Madagascar Pink Rice, 11-Pound Bag\nReview:\nYou'd think you can't go wrong with a basic staple like rice, right?  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this rice.  Lotus Foods Madagascar Pink Rice was described as having a hint of spice flavor such as cinnamon or clove.  I didn't pick up on that in the slightest.  In fact, this rice had very little flavor at all.  I normally buy brown basmati rice, or Lotus Foods Forbidden Rice which are fantastic all by themselves.  Those rices can be enjoyed without a speck of salt or other seasoning added.  The Madagascar Pink can't begin to compare.\n\nI wish this had been available in a small package instead of an 11 pound sack.  I read the full description on the Lotus Foods website and I liked the idea of this rice.  The Amazon subscription price was a great deal, so I went for it.  I'll still eat the rice, of course, but it will be served in recipes that don't depend on the rice for flavor like other whole grain rices provide.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nBUMBLE BEE Sensations Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Seasoned Tuna with Crackers, High Protein Food, Gluten Free Food, High Protein Snacks, Canned Food, Bulk Snacks, 3.6 Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis tuna kit is very convenient and is a great quick meal or snack while on the road or at the office. The contents are held securely by the outer packaging, so nothing will get broken or dinged. It even comes with a little plastic spreader to make it easier to eat. The amount is small, but it's just the right amount for a quick snack when you need a little energy. It's not something you would buy to keep in the kitchen since larger boxes of crackers and tins of tuna are much more affordable. However, it's perfect for what it is - a quick bite when you are away from home.  The tuna flavor is pleasant enough. The lemon pepper seasoning is mild and the tuna has a good texture.

They had melted so badly they could not be eaten. The chocolate pretzels were also melted, but after I saw the condition of the truffles I put all of the boxes into the refrigerator which helped set them back up.\n\nThe rest of the items were in good condition,...they tasted alright, but all of the items except for the Almond Roca  were  very generic and seemed like dollar store items.  However I give the seller 5 stars for contacting me , that was unexpected and I do appreciate it.\n\n*Original review below:\n\nIn all fairness the packaging is sort of pretty. Thats about it, there is next to nothing included in the tiny boxes. At least they could have used a bit more effort when it came to how much goes inside. Not worth the price, will probably add 'extra' from the store before giving it as a neighbor gift this year.

I use it on steaks, chops, chicken and even to eat French fries or tater tots. I even use it as a basting sauce for sausages or meat on the grill. I like some steaks plain but this sauce just adds zing to any kind of meat.\n\nSometimes I mix in some Frank's Red Hot sauce to even make it hotter to use when grilling out. It is also a great addition to barbeque wings mixed with Buffalo Sauce. We also pressure cook pork or beef and shred it for pulled meat sandwiches and this flavor just sets it off.\n\n* Ribs\n* Sausage\n* Steaks\n* Shrimp\n* Hamburger for tacos\n* Hamburger sandwiches\n* French fries, onion rings or tater tots\n* Chicken wings\n* It has 100's of uses\n\nIt does contain a lot of salt at 200 mg and 8% of your daily allotment for just one tablespoon. It also has 4 grams of sugar. I love it as my favorite steak sauce and I recommend it to you.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStarbucks Pike's Place Kcups-Medium Roast, 0.44 oz, 16 ct\nReview:\nEven though this is a medium roast blend of coffee it has the traditional rich, bold and full bodied Starbuck's flavor and aroma.  I drink my coffee with sweet and low and creamer in it and a cup of this coffee is tasty and satisfying.  I blend the large cup serving of 9.5 ounces and it is just the right strength for me.\n\nThis is an excellent coffee and I recommend it to you.  I have posted a photo for your information.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKnorr Pasta Sides, Beef 4.3 oz\nReview:\nMy wife and I cook for only the two of us and we have found these Knorr side dishes to be just right to go along with our dinner meal. They taste good and they are easy to prepare quickly. My wife likes fettuccini and we add parmesan cheese to jazz up the flavor and make it taste a little richer.  It is good with pork chops or chicken for example.\n\nThe package makes 2 servings and that is just right for us. Each serving has 290 calories after being prepared and only 2 sugars which is important for us. I like the product for its ease of preparation, fast cooking and good taste. I rated it at 4 stars.\n\nThis is just the right size to prepare for 2 people for dinner, we like it. It is fast and easy to fix!\n\nThis is a pretty good little side for not a lot of work or cooking time. We liked it a lot.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nDei Fratelli Pizza Sauce - All Natural - No Water Added - Never from Tomato Paste - 5th Generation Recipe (15 oz. cans; 12 pack)\nReview:\nWe like to make homemade pizzas and we have found this sauce to be of excellent taste and quality. It is very thick and slightly sweet with the right amount of spice in it for an excellent tasting home pizza. I have included photographs of the can and nutrition label for your information.\n\nIt tastes good and makes a better pizza than the other brands we have used. We rate this product as a 5 star product. It sells for about $1.50 a can so you may have to look around for the right price and shipping costs. It is a great product.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nChef Paul Magic Seasoning Blends Herbal Pizza and Pasta MagicBtls - 3 oz\nReview:\nThis pizza and pasta seasoning is just what it says it is, MAGIC!  It provides the right blend of spices for your Italian cooking and it is great when mixed into pizza or pasta sauce, meatballs, or any dish.  The wonderful thing about it is that it adds no calories, no fat, no salt, no carbohydrates and no MSG to your food.  It also contains no preservatives.\n\nIt is also very good for soups, salads, egg dishes and almost any casserole. There are some very good recipes on his web site and I like the breakfast pizza, it is pretty good.  We love this product and as I write this review I see that we are almost out of it so it is time to buy some more!  I recommend it to you.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDreamfields Pasta Healthy Carb Living - Elbows - 13.25 ounces\nReview:\nMy family likes pasta in all forms but some of us have to watch how much we eat as it can be bad on your blood sugar levels.  We started using this brand of pasta and it does reduce our sugar levels when compared to using regular pasta.\n\nI love this elbow pasta in our chili and as the cold weather has shown up we just had a pot of it last week.  It has a great taste and it is a good source of fiber.  Each serving has 190 calories and it contains 5 grams of dietary fiber per serving.  Using this pasta has helped us to still be able to enjoy our favorite foods in moderation and still be careful of our carbohydrates.  Using Dreamfield's calculations they claim that their glycemic index is 13 versus regular pasta with an index of 38.  I can only judge that my blood sugar is lower when we eat this pasta when compared to others.  Like everything else you have to eat this in moderation.\n\nThis is a good product and I recommend it to you.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKitchen Basics Beef Stock, 32 Fl Oz\nReview:\nWe love a lot of dishes with gravy, broth or sauces.  Yesterday my wife made a large homemade batch of chicken and egg noodles.  Many times you don't get enough broth and you have to add more as the egg noodles soak up a lot of the broth.  She likes this Kitchen Basics Cooking Stock as she can get it in the unsalted version.  She adds this into the chicken and WOW does it help to make a great dinner!  This is even good the next day to add in more broth to warm up your leftovers.  It is much better than using water and it doesn't dilute the flavor of your meal.\n\nWe like this broth a lot and we recommend it to you as a 5 star product.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSpecial K Cereal Cinnamon Pecan, 12.1 oz\nReview:\nThis is an excellent tasting cereal and my wife and I enjoy it for breakfast.  We both love the taste of cinnamon and the added pecans just make it taste better.  It is only 110 calories for the cereal and only 7 sugars.  It is healthier than most cereals with a good taste.\n\nI included a photo shot of the nutritional side panel for your information.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n4 Oz Glass Shaker - Cherrywood Smoked Sea Salt\nReview:\nThis is one of many gourmet salts that are available from the San Francisco Salt Company that are really excellent additions to any kitchen. This Cherrywood Smoked Salt is one of my favorites and I love it used as an ingredient in a rub onto a nice steak or a chicken that we are going to grill. This salt was a wonderful sweet and smoky taste that just adds to the flavor of the meat you are preparing. It was my favorite of the salts I sampled because of the added flavor it brought as a seasoning for your meals. It is not just a salt but it adds much more!\n\nIt is also good for seasoning fish, meats, vegetables, pasta eggs and more. It is even recommended to be used as a coating to the rim of the glass of your favorite ales or rum cocktails. It is made of pure sea salt that is slowly smoked over Maine Cherrywood fire and the impact that it makes to the taste of your food is amazing. It is like adding wood chips into your grill to enhance the flavor of your grilling.\n\nThe brown color of the salt also adds color to your meal and when applied it looks almost like a garnish on your vegetables or pasta dishes. When mixed into your sauces this just adds a special flavor that you will enjoy. This is a good product and my family liked it a lot. We rated it as a 5 star item.\n\nHere are some other salts that are available from San Francisco Salt Company:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Red-Alaea-Hawaiian-Salt-5oz-pouch-Fine-Grain/dp/B00CWI04O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Red Alaea Hawaiian Salt (5oz pouch Fine Grain)</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hawaiian-Black-Lava-Finishing-Salt-5oz-pouch-Fine-Grain/dp/B00CUR2WTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hawaiian Black Lava Finishing Salt (5oz pouch Fine Grain)</a>\n\nSherpa Pink Gourmet Himalayan Salt (5oz Pouch - Extra-Fine Grain)\n\nI was supplied a sample for test and tasting and I promised only a fair and honest review.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBetty Crocker Baking Mix, Sugar Cookie Mix, 17.5 Oz Pouch\nReview:\nWe are going to a big family get together today for Mother's Day to have 3 generations of family together. My wife baked up a big batch of these to take as an after meal desert. We will ice them and put sprinkles on them to dress them up. These things are always a hit with the kids and adults and they go quickly.\n\nThey are easy to make and have a wonderful homemade taste. In less than 20 minutes you have your cookies but of course you have to let them cool down before you ice them. We used Betty Crocker Fluffy White Icing as the topping.\n\nNo matter what the food will be at the get together I am sure that these cookies will be a hit!

I have to admit, I do like the new Starbucks K-cups, but they are almost as expensive as going to a Starbucks and buying coffee there, so I'll stick with my Tully's. I find the blend to be just the right mixture of smooth and bold. I can use a single K-cup twice to fill my 16 oz to-go mug and find that it's still strong enough.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

He is also gluten and dairy sensitive, so the stuff he can eat is very limited.

They were recommended as a way of controlling appetite.  I have to say that they are an acquired taste.  My pet name for them is \"baked hay\".  But, I eat them because they help fill me up, give me fiber, and have only a few calories in each one.\n\nAs long as I don't eat them \"straight\", they are good.  Many mornings, I eat them with a little bit of spray butter, cinnamon and Splenda.  Other times, I dip them in the soup I'm eating.  Yet other times, I melt cheese on them.

Usually, if it's gluten free, it has waaaay too much sugar, for example.  I tried a box of these cookies for him.  He tried them and said that they are surprisingly good.\n\nThey are not mereingues, even though they are shaped like those types of cookies.  They are regular cookie consistency.  There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.

Not only can he eat them, but they taste good as well.

My personal favorites were the dark chocoalte flavors, but I liked the milk chocolate varieties as well.  The chocolate is smooth and the flavors are nicely balanced with the chocolate.  The sweetness is not overwhelming; in fact, these chocoaltes are less sweet than a lot of other types of chocolates - a good thing for me.\n\nIf you are looking for a gift of chocolate for someone, this is a good choice.  There is a good variety.  The chocolates taste good.  And, you know what you are getting when you choose a bar.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea, Mayan Cocoa Spice, 16 Count (Pack of 6), Packaging May Vary\nReview:\nI tend to like spice teas and dessert teas, so this tea is a blend of the two.

I've never really liked the taste of greasy chips, but baked chips seemed so bland. These chips are the best  and you should give them a try. They are tasty and not greasy.

First it is a great hydrator and a container right after working in the yard really is invigorating.  I recently had a bad virus and this was a wonderful soothing benefit for my sore throat.  There are other benefits as well. There's a great book available about coconut water well worth buying.  Look it up, Amazon probably has it available..\n\nADDED NOTE:  I recently had surgery.  As I was coming out of the \"happy place\" I heard the surgeon yelling for the blood count results.  \"This guy lost a lot of blood, I think we might need to give him a transfusion\".  The nurse presented him with my test and he said, \"I'll be darned. It's normal.  It shouldn't be but it is.\" The nurse, who is from Hawaii, told the doctor they drink this stuff all the time and it's considered a life source.  She told him about the plasma bit. The smartass Urologist just looked at her and said something about stupid superstitious primitive beliefs. She just rolled her eyes and walked away.  What else could she do, this guy is THE surgeon and he thinks he knows everything.  Jerk thinks if you can't cure it with a knife or expensive pills and countless tests, it can't be any good.\n\nIf you've done any research on coconut water, you know how close it is to blood plasma and that they used it during WWII when they didn't have real plasma.  The fact that I drink this wonderful juice may not be the only reason my blood work was normal, but you'd have trouble convincing me that it wasn't a major contributor to keeping my blood chemistry as good as it was.  Only an 11 oz. box a day but I wouldn't be without it.\n\nADDED NOTE They've changed the top since I last ordered and I'd like to thank whom ever made the decision to do so.  The screw top is 1000% better than that old silver strip that never came off the same way twice in a row and didn't protect a partially filled box.  I hope they will continue to use this screw-top packaging from now on.

The first thing I noticed was the fact that it dissolved almost instantly  unlike a different rehydration drink I had tried in the past (NUUN). SOS Rehydrate had a refreshing flavor and tasted really good. It did not leave an after-taste in my mouth which is good.\n\nSOS Rehydrate should definitely be consumed with cold water in my opinion.

Was I going to turn into a modern day Euell Gibbons? Was my colon going to implode from all the fiber? After a playful smack on the head from the wife I decided to dive in.\n\nThe clusters have a pleasant, crumbly texture, while their taste is a lot like sweet popcorn. Even though popcorn wasn't invited to this pepita fiesta, thats still the dominant sensation. Fluffy, slightly buttery, and with a syrupy vanilla sugar glaze: this is what Id imagine vanilla cupcake popcorn is like.

I always keep some around. Now I normally prefer to brew my coffee in a French press or a single cone filter over the cup. I love freshly roasted coffee, so finding places that roast it daily is key. But many mornings or sometimes after dinner I will make Nescafe.\n\nTo me it's the best instant. The Starbuck's instant is too strong (although good for Mochas with milk), and many other brands just taste bitter and cheap.\n\nNot sure about now, but Nescafe was the ONLY instant that many restaurants kept around. It was better than keeping coffee on a hot plate for too long, and it was quick to make.\n\nEach of these little packs makes one cup of coffee...just add hot water and you're ready to go.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAquafusion Low Calorie Drink Mix, Blackberry Plum, 7 count (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nMy family loves powdered drink pouches. As long as they contain healthy ingredients I'm okay with that as it gets them to drink more water.\n\nThe AquaFusion mixes are real sugar and stevia. Not the best ingredients, but not the worst either. But, holy cow batman, are they sweet. Each pouch is supposed to be 2 servings, but that's too much. We cut it pouch down to 4 servings and it's just right.\n\nThe flavor is good. The blackberry is more pronounced than the plum, but it's good overall.\n\nThe only odd thing is the color. We've never used clear mixes before. Generally something berry flavored is blue or purple. Don't forget that you've added the AquaFusion already as you can't see it unless you try it.\n\nAll in all, not bad. But way too sweet in it's original serving suggestion. Knock it down to 4 servings per pouch and you'll be good to go.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNewman's Own Organic Mints, Peppermint, 1.76-oz.

Give me grains and sugars as our caveman ancestors ate them. Who cares if they only lived 26 years at best?\n\nMy pseudo-scientific test had only two criteria - taste and texture. If it tastes good I'm more likely to eat this product regularly and stash some at work. If it tastes like the high-school locker room after a homecoming game, then in the garbage chute it goes. Texture is also quite subjective. I'm not a fan of phlegmy gobs of gelatinous goo sliding around in my mouth or belly.\n\nI made my oatmeal with milk. Real milk. From a real cow. No reduced percentages of bovine goodness for me.\n\nLuckily I was surprised that this \"gluten free\" oatmeal was very tasty and didn't assault my senses. I was expecting an oral explosion of cardboard yuckiness. I won't say this is the best oatmeal that I ever shoved in my mouth, but it's decent. Decent enough to eat again. Decent enough to stash at work or a weekend camping.\n\nThe texture was pleasant. While it didn't make my undies damp, it seemed more refined than other oatmeals in a bag. Probably due to the extra processing. Kudos to Quaker for not turning these oats into mush.\n\nAll-in-all, I like these oats. The flavor is good and the texture is decent. My only concern is the increased cost because of the extra refining step. Luckily I don't need gluten-free products, but if you do, these oats are for you.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNescafe Instant Coffee, Ground Coffee, Light Roast, Tasters Choice, 132 Cups, 8 Ounce\nReview:\nFor years I've always enjoyed a cup of Taster's Choice.\n\nIt's fast, easy, and consistent.

I like the packaging, portability, lack of need for refridgeration, and concentrated aspect. Coffee-mate claims this is a triple strenght formula, but I think results will vary from person to person. I would put it at more of a double strength level. But it tastes pretty much the same as their little cup packages or the big container you need to refridgerate, so all is good. The fact that it is so portable and doesn't need refrideration is a definite plus. It may take you a few tried to figure out how much you need in your mug or travel container though.

I usually make a pot of regular drip coffee in the morning it gets used throughout the day. I also have a Nespresso machine which I love, but that is in another class. K-cups are not for you if you want a big, rich steaming mug of coffee. Most cups I've tried lack flavor and punch unless made at the absolute smallest size. Even then, they might not be the greatest coffee. For me, I usually need to brew two for a satisfying cuppa.\n\nWhat I find K-cups great for are an office environment, or if you want a quick cup of coffee that is freshly brewed. While not normally a flavored coffee person, this format lets me try different things. That is where the Two Rivers 40-count Mega Coffee selection shines. You get a wide variety of coffees (no decaf in mine) at a fair price. I would say that about half of them are flavored. They come loose in a box so half the fun is picking through them to find what you want to drink. I've only had a few of them (Workaholics Strait Grizzly, Hamilton Mocha Swirl, and Brooklyn Red Velvet), but brewed at the smallest size, I found them each to be distinctive and flavorful. This 40-pack *IS* for someone who wants to try different coffees and doesn't mind a small cup and would make a nice gift for someone in your life who owns a Kuerig and is adventurous when it comes to coffee. It is also good for helping you track down what K-Cups are good and which aren't so hot. I'm looking forward to seeing what my \"mystery\" cup is, but am saving it for last.\n\nI received a sample pack for objective review purposes.\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCommunity Coffee 100% Pure Chicory Medium Roast Premium Ground 12 Oz Bag (6 Pack), Rich Flavorful Taste Naturally Decaf\nReview:\nI've purchased this chicory directly from Community Coffee in the past and thought I'd share my experience here. I rarely see any chicory in my local supermarket and then usually only the pre-blended&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/French-Market-City-Roast/dp/B002ZOPRT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">French Market City Roast</a>, which I think is good, but not great. I prefer to have total control over how much chicory I add to my coffee, and blend in a bit less than the manufacturer recommends dependent on the strength of the coffee. Chicory seems to work best with a heartier roast, mellowing it out and making it less acidic. My recommendation would be to try adding one scoop to every 3 scoops of coffee and then adjusting it to taste. Also be sure to use a bit less overall when adding chicory. I find a little goes a long way. I DO NOT recommend drinking it in place of coffee, though I've read that they used to do that when beans were scarce. It's okay (when drunk hot), but it works much better as a coffee enhancer. Chicory is not for everyone however, so if possible, try before you buy. Six bags will last you quite a while!\n\nI've had nothing but good experience with Community Coffee products and their Pure Chicory is no exception. I've yet to find a better economical 100% chicory. Try mixing this with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Community-Coffee-s-Private-Reserve-Whole-Bean-Coffee-Louisiana-Blend-Medium-Dark-Roast/dp/B002Y2QSMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Community Coffee's Private Reserve Whole Bean Coffee, Louisiana Blend - Medium-Dark Roast</a>&nbsp;for an exceptional cup of coffee!\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCoffee Mate Coffee Creamer, Pumpkin Spice Table-Top Pump Bottle, 21.1-Ounce\nReview:\nCoffee-mate creamer is one of my few indulgences. My daily cuppa wouldn't be the same without it. I know it isn't the healthiest product on Earth with numerous artificial ingredients, but is are low cal and adds to the flavor of my coffee. I usually have vanilla or hazelnut, but thought I would give Pumpkin Spice a go. There is a tea by that name which I like to drink during the cooler months. These special edition flavors can be fun to try and have on occasion.\n\nI'm impressed with Pumpkin Spice. It is actually a flavor I'd have on a regular basis. Cinnamon and sweetness pervade with pleasant pumpkin undertone. This is thick like the more concentrated Coffee-mate creamer that Nestle just started offering in squeeze bottles. One squirt is good for a regular cup for me, and three is great for my large travel mug. It is sweet enough that I don't have to add any additional sweetener. The pump is handy as well. It was easy to assemble and once I figured out how to twist the top just right to release the pump I was in business. It has a solid feel when pressing it down and it doesn't drip. This size and format would work well in an office environment, but knowing how much coffee I drink, it is good for home use as well.\n\nI hope they release a \"Natural Bliss\" version, but I'm content to enjoy Pumpkin Spice, artificial ingredients and all.\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nJava Factory Single Cup Coffee for Keurig K Cup Brewers, Dark and Handsome Dark Roast, 24 Count\nReview:\nJava Factory's offering has above average variety for a multi-pack. Translation -- I like most of them.  Smooth Caffeinator and Wakey Wakey are not ones I would choose to drink, but they were not undrinkable. They just weren't to my tastes, a bit on the light side. The other Cup varieties are darn good, even the flavored ones which are normally not my favorites. Dark & Handsome makes a great morning cup, and Da Bomb is a rich tasting caffeine explosion. The two flavored varieties make good dessert coffees, or regular cups for those who are into that. Actually, Vanilla Dream might just be the best tasting out of the bunch.\n\nAll cups worked flawlessly with my Keurig. If getting another mixed pack, this would be on my shortlist. I received a sample of this product for objective review purposes.\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLavazza Gran Selezione Ground Coffee Blend, Dark Roast, 12-Ounce Bag\nReview:\nI'm a coffee maven and take great pride in making that perfect cup of joe. I've tried all kinds of coffee, and as my wife has observed, have my coffee-making technique down to a science. I'm always on the lookout for a coffee with good flavor. For maximum freshness I prefer to grind my own beans, preferably freshly roasted. The LavAzza Gran Selezione Ground Coffee Blend comes finely ground (ideal for espressos and drip makers). Given it's already ground and roasted in Italy, I was impressed with how fresh tasting it is. It made a rich, smooth pot of coffee. Gran Selezione is labeled \"intense and chocolaty\" and though I detect it, my wife didn't really notice. She complimented me on how delicious the coffee I had made for her was (I did not tell her it was LavAzza until afterwards). It passed the wife test and she wanted me to brew it again the next day.\n\nI like that LavAzza is a family owned business that is responsible with their sourcing. This coffee tastes like it was roasted with care and is something I would have no hesitation getting again. On a scale of 1-10, it is an intensity level of 7 -- a moderate dark roast.  For a coffee of this price range, it's an exceptional value. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a quality cup of coffee and prefers the convenience of pre-ground beans.\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKauai Coffee Single-serve Pods, Island Sunrise Mild Roast &ndash; 100% Premium Arabica Coffee from Hawaii&rsquo;s Largest Coffee Grower, Keurig-Compatible Cups - 12 Count\nReview:\nI love Kona coffee. That and Blue Mountain are my favorites. A couple of months ago, I found Kauai ground coffee on sale at my local grocer and gave it a shot. Both myself and my wife were impressed. It has most of the characteristics of a rich and mellow Kona coffee without the huge price tag. Even in pre-ground form it was good.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and I get these K-cup single-serve compatibles from Amazon. I've found many K-cups to be a bit weak and unimpressive, but was pleased to find that these compatibles live up to the Kauai standard.  While perhaps oh-so-slightly weaker than what I would brew in the regular coffee maker, they still retain their flavor as single-serve options. The format is not quite K-cup, but worked well in my unit and looks like it is more environmentally friendly.\n\nI only use my Keurig occasionally, but I've found a K-cup that I am happy to stock for those occasions!\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKona Smooth Hawaiian Coffee, Our Kings Reserve DIAMOND, 8 Oz Whole Bea\nReview:\nI won't say this is the best coffee in the world; because I have yet to try them all and everyone's tastes differ.  However, from my 20+ years of coffee drinking and of all the Kona coffee's I've tasted, THIS one reigns supreme.  And it better for that price!  But if you appreciate a well rounded, flavorful coffee, then this is the one to try.\n\nI lived in Hawaii for 3 years and was introduced to Kona coffee at the source.  Of all the coffees I've had in my life, Kona is my favorite.  It is the richest and smoothest you could imagine.  Others are good, but not in this class.  Also, watch out for Kona coffee blends.  They can be tasty, but are usually only 10% Kona beans and not the top crops at that.  This is the primo stuff here!  There really is something in that Volcanic soil on the Big Island.\n\nA word of caution though.  Drink this at your own risk.  It is very hard to go back to \"normal\" coffee after tasting this nectar of the gods.

They tend to be fruity and very sweet. The ginger flavor is stronger here than in some other sodas, and it isn't quite as sweet as some, but it still isn't what I'd consider an extra strong ginger brew.  It isn't bad and is likely a good mixer with the additional fruit flavors, but if you are looking for pure, strong ginger beer/ale, this shouldn't be your first choice.\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['good', 'like', 'kort', 'flavor', 'tea', 'coffee', 'would', 'one', 'chocolate', 'healthy']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nGinger People Organic Crystallized Ginger Box -- 4 oz Each\nReview:\ntoo big. and too much sugar\nRating:\n2.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

These are very tasty and not too hot.  Awesome jalapeno flavor.  I like these better than the fire hot cheetos.  The only negative is that these have MSG and other bad chemicals.  This is why I stopped buying these kinds of snacks a long time ago and who knows what else is in this so-called food product.  MSG is one of the worst chemicals you can eat.  There is no reason to add MSG in any food items.  If you don't care what you eat or you just like to cheat on something bad once in awhile, these are tasty but highly addictive.  I personally won't be buying these anymore unless they get rid of the MSG and other chemicals they don't need.

DARK CHOCOLATE\nReview:\nPurchased this because I love English butter toffee with Almonds and I have purchased just about all from Amazon. First of all this is a little bit on the well done side. I can see how one reviewer said that it was burnt. I am not sure about their method or any method of making this. I can only say that the flavor is mild. Tastes like the sugar content is half of what it usually taste like. Basically it is not really sweet, some people may like that I kind of don't like it this way. This Toffee also contains Almonds inside not just sprinkled on top of the dark chocolate. That in itself may make taste less sweet.\n  The appearance looks very good like homemade. It appears that much care was put into making this toffee so I do not believe it is darker in appearance by accident. This Toffee is very well made and its presentation is great. Now I am making my critique based on my favorite English Butter Toffee with Almonds and that is Aunt Mae's Sweet Tooth. Aunt Mae's is made with milk chocolate sprinkled with Almonds. It is the kind of Toffee I was brought up eating. The taste is twice as sweet as this and has no almonds mixed in the Toffee itself.\n  Both of these brands are made in big sheets and broken to fit inside the box. Depending on what you are used to or you like Toffee that is not too sweet ? If you want Toffee on the mild side then this is great and deserves five stars. For my personal taste and probably most people that like English Butter Toffee are going to like Aunt Mae's because it is more traditional and very thick. I'm only giving this four stars because it is not my favorite because it is not sweet enough and may have a well done taste to it?\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTonnino Ventresca Tuna in Olive Oil 6.7 oz.

When I purchase peppercorns in the super market, they cost a small fortune. So these are well worth the price. I have seen Peppercorns that were larger in size but these make up for it in freshness and flavor. If you have one of those empty one quart containers from your Chinese take out? Save it. You will want to store these in the refrigerator. I toast these in a fry pan lightly before use and it brings these to another level.

The extra sugar, of course, makes it extra yummy.  No, it's not traditional oatmeal and instead instant, with the drawbacks of salt and no control over the flavoring amounts, but it makes a quick and nutritious breakfast.  I tend to use skim milk instead of water for a creamier texture.

And the instructions directed me to add 1/2 cup of water to that small portion.  My first try resulted in too-thin oatmeal, so the next time I used 1/3 cup (and 1 minute in the microwave).  That ended up with a thicker hot cereal more to my tastes, but I had to let it sit more afterward to better \"cook\" the oatmeal.\n\nThe taste is pretty good for an instant hot cereal, but there's a weird, powdery, tongue-coating sensation that comes with it even though the oatmeal is moist.  It's not a taste, per se, or even a true chalkiness.  It's just . . . strange.  Once I got used to it, however, it didn't bother me.  I do like that the berries -- the blueberries, in particular -- aren't chewy after preparation like so many other dehydrated fruit products.  Because there are no artificial flavors, you don't get that cloying artificial \"berry\" taste that some products have.  Yeah, it doesn't taste like fresh berries, but it's much better than most.  The cereal contains soy and milk, although I don't see anything milk-like in the ingredient list.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLindt Excellence Bar, 70% Cocoa Smooth Dark Chocolate, Gluten Free, 3.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI love Lindt chocolate, and this collection has something for everyone, which made it great to use as stocking stuffers this past Christmas.  I'm more of a dark chocolate woman, so the extra creamy milk didn't appeal to me, although my mother-in-law loved hers.  These are solid bars -- that is, they don't have creamy fillings.  For example, the intense orange has bits of orange rind in it rather than an orange filling.  The 70% and 85% dark chocolate bars are great for cooking or snacking.  All bars arrived unbroken, unmelted, and fresh.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCAILLER L'Art du Brut, Milk Chocolate with whole Almonds, Hazelnuts &amp; Raisins,  6.9 ounce bars (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nThis milk chocolate bar with almonds, hazelnuts, and raisins is heavy on the milk and sugar, light on the chocolate flavor, but still delicious.  It is packed with nuts and raisins -- they stick up through the top of the segments.  If you are a lover of milk chocolate, nuts, and fruit, then you've probably found your bar.\n\nEach bar is a hefty 6.87 ounces.  To give you a comparison, Ghirardelli and Lindt large bars run about 3.5 ounces.  Although Cailler is manufactured by Swiss Nestl&eacute;, the high milk content is more reminscent of Cadbury than the Nestl&eacute; bars Americans are used to.  The milk tends to give the chocolate a creamier texture, though less intense flavor.\n\nThis chocolate bar satisfies my sweet tooth and cravings for nuts more than it does when my craving for chocolate, probably because I usually reach for dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate.  If you like milk chocolate more than dark, you will likely love these bars.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSkippy Natural Creamy Peanut Butter Spread with Honey, 15 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis Skippy peanut butter tastes like those honey-roasted peanuts you sometimes get in a bar -- and it's just as addictive.  It's smooth, sweet, and full of peanut flavor.  Of course, if you prefer non-sweet peanut butter, then run away as fast as you can.  This peanut butter contains more sugar per serving than than regular Jif -- 5 versus 3 grams -- so don't buy this thinking it's more healthy.  It contains no mono- or diglycerides, however.\n\nI grew up on Skippy peanut butter, but when I tasted Jif as an adult, I was hooked on the sweeter taste and switched brands.  Of course, I've also eaten natural peanut butters over the years, and they usually contained no sugar.  I was surprised that this \"natural\" brand had so much sugar added.  Kids and those of us with a sweet tooth will love the taste of this Skippy; I'm not sure health-conscious parents will.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFood Should Taste Good, Tortilla Chips, Multigrain Bean Chips, Pinto Bean, 5.5 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese sturdy chips taste great, with the nutty flavor of beans and seeds.  Although they are salted, the salt is not overbearing, and the grain flavor comes through as the strongest flavor.\n\nDespite the ingredients of pinto beans, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, sesame seeds, and quinoa, these are still chips, and therefore are not as healthy as eating these ingredients separately.  They also contain stone ground corn (second ingredient, after pinto beans), brown rice flour, and cane sugar.  The serving size of 10 chips/1 oz. contains 3 g of fiber, 3 g of protein, and 2 g of sugar.  To compare, the Snyders pretzels I have in my pantry have, in 1 ounce, the same amount of fiber but only 1 gram of protei and no sugar in a single serving.  One ounce of these chips has 140 calories; one ounce of the pretzel have only 100 calories.\n\nAs a side to a sandwich or as a snack, these multigrain bean chips are great, as long as you accept that they are still extra calories without much nutritional content.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHershey's Caramels, Dark Chocolate Caramels, 7.2 Ounce (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nThese individually wrapped caramels have the perfect dark chocolate to caramel ratio.

I kinda go all-out with this.  You are supposed to use 1 tablespoons per can of coconut milk, but I use the whole package to give my stir-fry an intense flavor and medium-hot spice level.  I saut&eacute; bell peppers, onions, carrots, and broccoli with my choice of protein (chicken, salmon, shrimp), if any, and cook until just done.  I add the paste and cook for an addition minute, adding the coconut milk last, heating until hot.  Served over jasmine rice, it's one of my family's favorite meals.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nORCHARD VALLEY HARVEST Cranberry Almond Cashew Trail Mix, Non-GMO, No Artificial Ingredients, 1 oz (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nAlthough I'm not normally a fan of raisins, I like chocolate-covered raisins, especially when they are paired with nuts as they are in this Orchard Valley mix.  Each 8-ounce bag contains eight individual bags for an easily portioned amount.  The size is perfect for sticking in a gym bag for a quick pick-me-up before or after exercise or to throw in a bag lunch.  I plan to travel with a few of these since I can't always access food when I'm in transit.  The individual packets each contain 150 calories: 4 grams of protein and 7 grams of sugar.  The sea salt (50 mg sodium in each serving) brings out the flavor of the almonds and peanuts.  Everthings tastes fresh and (except for the chocolate) wholesome.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['debbie', 'lee', 'wesselmann', 'chocolate', 'flavor', 'like', 'taste', 'tea', 'although', 'milk']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nSimplyProtein Nut and Fruit Bar, Apricot Almond Coconut, 12 Count\nReview:\nYOU CAN NOT CONVINCE ME THESE ARE GOOD FOR YOU.\nANY PROTEIN BAR, THAT TASTE LIKE THESE ARE SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE ABOUT PROTEIN IN GENERAL.\nTRY ZONE BARS!!

The ITC Hotel chefs who created this recipe are very well regarded in India. Its just the right mix for a spicy lamb curry, all you need to do is mix it with water and add the lamb and then let it simmer on your stove for 30-45 minutes to bring out the aromas and flavors. Really convenient and time saving.\n\nThe lamb curry paste is spicier than a butter chicken curry mix. The chicken curry usually has a more creamy consistency and is sweeter due to higher content of tomatoes. The lamb curry has a base of garlic, ginger, black pepper, onions, tomatoes and other highly aromatic Indian spices (bayleaf, cinnamon, star anise, cardamom, cloves, black cardamom, shah jeera, corriander seeds, red chilli powder etc.).\n\nI usually make my own curry as I prefer fresh ingredients but this mix is wonderful, it has just the right blend of spices that go into lamb curry. The secret to Indian food is to lower the flame once a curry boils and then simmer it for quite some time. This step is not a must if you're in a tearing hurry but it unlocks the real flavors.\n\nOnce done this curry keeps very well in the refrigerator. In fact, as with all spicy curries, it even tastes better the next day. I use two packets at a time to make an entree for 6 people.\n\nVariations:\nI sometimes add some 1X1.5 inch cubes of diced potatoes along with the lamb to absorb the spiciness which makes it into a \"Lamb Vindaloo\". Or you can use beef instead of lamb, it will taste great with any red meat that absorbs the spice.\n\nIf you're a vegetarian, you can use this curry with potatoes and green peas since the curry paste does not contain any meat in it. Just remember to add peas towards the end of the simmering process or they will get bleached out and you'll get a fantastic dish.\n\nPairing:\nPair this lamb curry with some aromatic basmati rice, cooked till all grains are done but still separate, and a bowl of plain yogurt (with a little sugar if you like) to counter the spiciness. Or you can also buy frozen Indian nan/roti from the local Indian grocery store, toast it in the oven and enjoy.

I think now that I will need it every three months, because we have been using it up really fast! It has become our preferred tea, and I seldom use any other type since we have discovered this brand.\n\nWhen properly steeped this tea produces excellent results. I allow it to steep for about one hour, perhaps one-and-a-half; once I left it overnight and it was too bitter, so watch the time.\n\nThis is by far the best iced tea I have ever tasted.

This soup is outstanding on its own, and for low carbers/diabetics, it is a special treat. I use this mostly as a sauce for chicken, pork chops, veggies. I treat it like mushroom soup for a sauce, thinning with cream or broth if needed, which normally I don't.  It has just a bit of spiciness to it, and for me it makes a big difference in ease of prep and added variety to what are sometimes bland dishes. There are few canned soups I like, but Progresso makes the ones I find palatable.

The coffee itself is a mild blend, but it has a slightly harsh aftertaste. I also drink my coffee with cream but that's not enough to mask the harshness. I also wish the cinnamon flavor was more intense. If I were to do a blind taste test I'm not sure I could identify what the coffee flavor or smell is supposed to be. So I'm marking it down one star for harshness, and marking it down a second star for a weak flavor. Other than that, it's not a bad coffee and has a decent mouthfeel.\n\nMy husband and I have been buying the Monin syrups to make flavored dessert coffees. The cinnamon pastry makes a good base if you add some flavoring syrup to make it sweet. I think a little sugar could also round out the rough edges of the flavor. Vanilla and toasted marshmallow syrups are my favorites with this coffee.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this coffee a 5.\nRating:\n3.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I just peeled myself off the ceiling after drinking a cup of this. This might be better named \"Double Sugar\" Flavor Hot Chocolate mix.\n\nFirst, the good stuff. There is no doubt in my mind that Ghirardelli continues to make a distinctive, excellent quality chocolate. The cocoa used in this mix is smooth, dark, fruity and aromatic. Nothing else like it that I've ever tasted.\n\nNow, the criticism. There is just too much sugar in the mix. The recommended proportion of mix to 8 oz milk is four tablespoons. (By the by, there is no powdered milk in here. You must add your own milk--or soymilk or rice milk--great option for lactose-intolerant types.)\n\nPeople, you are using a quarter cup of mix at 4 Tbs and most of the mix seems to be granulated sugar, which you can taste and crunch in your mouth if you sample the dry mix. Cutting down fifty percent on the mix gave me an acceptable cup of cocoa but...it was no longer double chocolate and it had naturally a poorer mouth feel and aroma.\n\nDouble Chocolate Mix is some of the best cocoa I WOULD have had, if Ghirardelli could see their way to making a lower sugar version, and please, no sugar substitute, which I don't like to use.\n\nSummary; great chocolate flavor, unsurpassed. But overly sweet. If you don't like supersweet cocoa, pass this up. If you do love extremely sweet hot drinks, you will absolutely adore this mix.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBarista Prima Italian Roast Coffee Keurig Vue Portion Pack, 24 count\nReview:\nIf you like strong, dark coffee, the Barista Italian roast for the Vue cup is excellent. I make it on the STRONG setting for 8oz and it's perfect. In fact, it's better than what I make in my regular pot unless I have very fresh coffee just ground from beans. The color is a rich, blackish brown, the roast is dark but not burnt-tasting and of all the coffees for the Vue I've tried, this one wins hands-down. I have the same blend in K-cups (for the office, where the K version sits) and they are not as good, for some reason. The Vue is not the most economical way to make coffee (that would probably be a plastic Melitta filter with a paper cone and a mug or a French Press) but the Keurig is fast and convenient. And I get the coffee the strength and temperature just the way I like it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBarista Prima House Blend Keurig K-Cups,18 Count\nReview:\nI had a sampler and tried Italian Roast, Columbian, House Blend and a few other Barista blends.

Of all the coffees I've tried in the Keurig, this one is by far the best. It's balanced and hearty.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKrusteaz Belgian Supreme Waffle Mix, 28-Ounce Box (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is an excellent mix for waffles. You can make them with or without the egg and oil, but they are better with those ingredients added. Waffles are not diet food.\n\nThere is a trick to make really crisp light waffles, however. Make up the mix according to directions but do it this way:\n\n1. Substitute melted butter for some or all of the oil.\n2. Separate the egg. Add the yolk as you mix the rest of the ingredients, then beat the egg white until stiff and fold it in as the last step (put the whipped egg white on top of the batter, turn it in with a spatula, cutting it in gently until it is just mixed and the egg white is not showing lumps of white.)\n\nThis trick will also work with any gluten free mix you may use (and those flours tend to be heavier than this mix.) I also add a pinch of ground cloves or cinnamon to add some flavor. Naturally, using a very good waffle maker, such as this one, will insure you get the lightest, fluffiest waffles you can make. There are many good ones on the market but I use a relatively simple one&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Presto-Waffler/dp/B000TYBWIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Presto Waffler.</a>&nbsp;The key is to flip the waffle during cooking to make sure the center is evenly baked.\n\nThere are ways to top the waffles that may surprise you. My dad's favorite was cream cheese and apple butter. I had them with strawberries and huge mounds of whipped cream in Luxembourg, and the best way I ever had them was with cherries (rather like pie filling) and whipped cream in a little mountain village in Germany. Those were awesome. As I said, not diet food, though you can simply dust them with powdered sugar and they still are pretty darn tasty.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa Keurig Vue Portion Pack, 32 Count\nReview:\nThis hot chocolate is nice and convenient and you can brew it strong or less strong because the VUE lets you customize temperature and volume. But sad to say, I found it too sweet. The reason for it's being sweet is that in addition to sugar, it is sweetened with sucralose (aka Splenda.) This is a new trend in foods-- a mix of natural and artificial sweeteners. (Have you seen chewing gum? Even the non-sugar-free varieties have aspartame?) The reason for using a mix of natural and artificial is interesting but I believe in this case, using sucralose lowers the calorie count of the cocoa and it also allows more sweetener in a smaller cup size, as sucralose takes up less space than granulated sugar. I had to tease out the ingredient info by carefully reading the box, as it doesn't say so on the cup.\n\nHere's the good news, if you don't want sucralose, or even if you don't want sugar AND sucralose, you can buy packet cocoas and make a cup of hot water with the VUE, any volume and temp you choose. Just mix it up yourself. The only powdered mix I ever liked was Caotina (from Switzerland) which was not so sweet as American varieties but I can't find it in the US. However, I have guests who adore hot chocolate when they visit my office or home, so I keep Swiss Miss on hand.\n\nIn any case, for the Cafe Escapes, blech!\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nCelestial Seasonings Half and Half Perfect Iced Tea, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 22-Count\nReview:\nI love this blend of tea--I've been drinking it since it came on the market. Sleepytime may have changed its package over the years but the blend is the same--lime blossom (linden flowers or tilia, same thing), chamomile and spearmint. This is a brilliant mix, the linden and chamomile floral, sweet and soporific, the spearmint adding just enough of a hit to make it interesting. It's good as an after-dinner digestif, or as a before-bed soothing drink. And it tastes really delicious\n\nEach ingredient has a purpose; linden is a relaxer and is said to restore the liver (hence, it's used as a tisane in France, where livers are always suspected of being upset), chamomile is a tension-tamer and soothes the stomach, and spearmint is a digestive--helps after a heavy meal.\n\nYou actually don't need to have K-cups--just brew a cup of hot water from the Keurig and dip in a Sleepytime tea bag. But if you are serving guests at table or in your office, the K cup makes a cup of tea without the bag to deal with. Since I serve tea in my office (as well as coffee), the K cups are on hand for guests in several flavors (Sleepytime and Mandarin Orange.) At home, I simply use the bag version.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCelestial Seasonings Half and Half Perfect Iced Tea, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 22-Count\nReview:\nThese cups are nice for our office--we can have teas on hand for guest who don't drink coffee. I like the \"Sleepytime\" which despite the name, is a good after-lunch tea. The linden flowers and spearmint are very soothing. But there is only ONE herbal in this selection (leaving out the Mandarin Orange, which is very popular) and well, you can throw a black tea bag, even a premium tea bag, into a cup of water drawn off the Keurig and it's a lot less expensive.\n\nTo do this, you simply set the machine for 10 oz and don't put a K-cup in the holder (you do have to open it and shut it to tell the machine \"ready!\") Then push the brew button and you get a cup of hot water. Throw in a bag. Cost? Maybe 10 pennies, depending on what you had to spend on the tea bags.\n\nThe nice thing about Keurig brewed tea is no bag and the strength is usually perfect. But unless you worry about mess or have a public serve-yourself-area where you want to limit cleanup to throwing away K-cups and sugar packets, then these are kind of an unnecessary luxury. I had a set, but I won't rebuy them.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill  Scottish Oatmeal, 20 oz\nReview:\nIf you eat oatmeal for health or because you like it, this is a different porridge for your breakfast. Instead of the flaky texture of rolled oats or the heavy, thick and chewy texture of steel-cut (pinhead) oats, this is more like a mush or a cream of wheat texture. The oats are flaked and milled so it's like a coarse meal rather than whole flakes or chopped whole grain. It cooks up in 10 minutes to a porridge consistency. You might say it's a bit more like oatbran porridge only not as mushy. There is some substance to the texture.\n\nThis is a good change from rolled oats or steel cut. It cooks faster --10 minutes in a pot of boiling water. You can microwave a single serving, but I found it tends to foam up in the microwave, so I do it in a small saucepan on the stove. After you stir the oats in at a boil, it cooks on the lowest heat and needs hardly any stirring.\n\nI was able to get my blood lipids to a healthy level simply by eating no red meat and adding servings of oatmeal almost every day. Your results may differ, but for me, this is a healthful food to add to my diet and it's enjoyable.\n\nThe mealy texture makes this good for baking. I use it in oatcakes--where you knead some oats, some shortening, and some buttermilk into a dough and roll it out and bake it on a griddle or a baking stone. It makes a sort of soft cracker-like flatbread that is very good with butter, jam or honey with a good cup of tea or coffee. This also works well in muffins.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'tea', 'good', 'flavor', 'coffee', 'rice', 'sugar', 'make', 'use', 'cup']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nPowerBar Fruit Smoothie Energy Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThe texture is strange and the flavor unpleasant.

As I brew 4 gallons at a time, not having to rip open, tap empty and dispose of 64 packets was nice, but that still does not make up for this liquid's triple net sweetening cost.  Should I find it again under $5/ounce I would get more, barring that - I'll probably go back to using cheaper packets.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDilmah Tea, 100% Pure Ceylon Tea, Loose Leaf, 4.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI used to buy Ceylon labeled tea exported from middle eastern countries&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ahmad-500g-Loose-Ceylon-Tea-1-23-Ounce-Packet-Pack-of-4/dp/B001EO5ZMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ahmad 500g Loose Ceylon Tea, 1.23-Ounce Packet (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;for around $12 per kilo, only to later learn about high mountain genuine (lion&sword seal) Ceylon from Sri Lanka.  Being able to buy the real thing on Amazon for $20 per kilo was an amazing find for me, as I brew a Gallon per day using a drip style coffee maker.  Only 1g per cup is needed here, not the typical 2g per cup you may need with cheaper loosely packed leafy Ceylons, so each box can yeild over a hundred 8oz cups of tea - as no leaf rinsing is needed.\nThis is NOT some low quality crushed leaf dust, just a fine packed leaf that requires a paper filter to brew to yield a crystal clear amber tea - don't use a hole steeper - only a fine screen will do.  This is an affordable leaf type especially for ice tea lovers.  This malty neutral pH tea, combines well with fruit, spices, citrus, and even milk.\nUPDATE:  I'm just about to reorder and wanted to share that drip method ice tea *makers&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mr-Coffee-TM3-2W-3-Quart-Iced-Tea-Maker/dp/B002EDZWSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mr. Coffee TM3-2W 3-Quart Iced Tea Maker</a>&nbsp;like me - can save even more money by using only 1/2g per cup - and you will still get a dark amber full flavor tea.  So for every gallon (16 cups) I brew, I use just 8g of this tea leaf, with 16x yellow 1g Splenda packets, and get perfect lightly sweet sugar free tea every time!  That gets my cost per large 8oz cup of fresh brewed no preservative iced tea down under 10.  Flavor with a tablespoon of cranberry or grapefruit juice for an extra kick.  This tea the best balance of quality and afford ability.  I have tried other Dilmah teas including; Ran Watte, Uda Watte, Supreme, Earl Grey, and these little blue boxes are the only ones worth reordering.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDilmah Tea, Earl Grey Tea, Loose Leaf, 4.4-Ounce Tins (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nthe Bergamot used here smells and tastes like rancid Lychee nuts, so if you are just looking for a pleasant black tea, pick something else.  A tea at this price point should not be using \"flavoring\" but the real essence, oil or dehydrated Bergamot citrus fruit.  The leaves are cut up into 2mm bits, so you must use a paper filter when seeping this loose tea.  The double capped tin does a fine job of air sealing the tea, so there is no need for an inner foil wrapper as others have contested.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nGolden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky, Teriyaki,  3.25 Ounce Pouches (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nI have tried every GoldenValleyNatural.com Jerky product.  By far the best are all the Sweet N'Spicy and Peppered Flavors.  Beef tends to be smoky and fatty, while Turkey is dry and flaky, making their Buffalo meat varieties the best of them all.\n\nAvoid their Low Carb Jerky unless you are willing to bite off tic-tac size bites and chew for a minute each time.  All the Teriyaki Jerkys have the texture and taste like sweet Corned Beef, so I'd skip them as well.\n\nIf you want to try different flavors, instead of 8 of the same from Amazon, just go directly to their web sight and buy them for only 15% more than Amazon's sale price.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLindt Excellence Bar, 70% Cocoa Smooth Dark Chocolate, Gluten Free, 3.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nsalt is good in chocolate only if it's a few large grains scattered about (like chocolate chips on a cookie) so you taste the good chocolate, then get hit by a bit of a salt surprise.  here lindt just diluted extra salt into an average chocolate, and the results are just awful - and thanks to amazon i'm now stuck with 5 more bars of this junk.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nBarry's Irish Breakfast Tea, 80-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThis is not a cheap Yorkshire Gold knockoff, rather it's an acidic Indian black with a distinct bergamot note, like a pathetic attempt at Earl Grey.

I was not impressed with some of Lundberg's flavors I got locally for about $4/bag because they simply sandwich dry spices between each basic white cake instead of integrating them into the processing.  I was able to S&S a $1/bag deal thanks to a \"deal of the day\" so I'm posting this to thank Amazon and Lundberg for a box with 10 months good till use date.  I double bagged my dozen bag box to ensure they don't gain moisture during the few months it will take me to finish them all off.  The timing of this purchase was perfect, since I'm trying to avoid bread cake cookie and pasta, so keeping rice cakes handing really helps fill that texture void.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nOrville Redenbacher's Gourmet Microwavable Popcorn, Natural Simply Salted 50% Less Fat, 3-Count Boxes 8.55 Oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nAmazon's description of this items is wrong;\nit's 2.9-ounce bags (total 36 bags, 104 ounces)\neach bag yields about 4.5 cups of popped corn.\nit contains Palm oil, not Soybean oil, and the\ningredients are not all \"natural\"; it contains an\norganic Tocopherol preservative.

AHA! Garbanzo flour to the rescue and this brand is the best I've ever had. It held the patties together fully as well--or better--than eggs did. I'm a happy camper. BTW, I do the \"throw together\" method of cooking. Ingredients are quick oats, garbanzo flour, chopped fresh mushrooms, chopped onion, Braggs, coconut aminos, olive oil, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, sea salt and enough water to combine everything.  Baked them on an oiled cookie sheet @ 350 until brown, turned once. The mushrooms keep them moist. YUM!!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Fava Beans, 20 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nMy doctor prescribed fava beans for my tremor in June of this year. Since then, I have bought boxes of fava beans. These are the best quality for the best price of any of the ones available and they aren't readily available! I have them on subscription to get the better price and use a package of them every three days or so. I have recommended them to others. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because some of the beans are not completely peeled and I have to laboriously clean them off. Inevitably, there are little pieces of the germ under the \"flap\" of the bean that, for all the world, look like bugs when they're cooked. Otherwise, if you have to eat fava beans on a regular basis (I eat a cup of cooked beans twice a day) you can't go wrong with these.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWholesome Organic Raw Blue Agave Nectar, Syrup, Low Glycemic Sweetener, Non GMO, 44 Oz (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nI've been using mostly light raw organic agave nectar for years now but this is so rich and sweet it takes less than the other.

This is my favorite of all the dressings Foods Alive makes. It's best used straight out of the fridge. Otherwise, it thins out too much and doesn't stick to the salad as well.

She knew that I have a Keurig 35 B30 Mini Brewer (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Keurig-35-B30-Mini-Personal-Single-Serve-Brewing-System-Black/dp/B001CTXWM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Keurig 35 B30 Mini Personal Single-Serve Brewing System, Black</a>) at work.  I make at least two cups of coffee in the morning and sometimes one in the afternoon if I'm feeling sleepy.  (I work two jobs and I am sleep deprived.)  I've had this Keurig brewer for at least three years and I couldn't live without it.  However, disposable K-Cups are expensive; this is why I purchased the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Keurig-My-K-Cup-Reusable-Coffee-Filter/dp/B000DLB2FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>).  At the time, I thought it was wonderful.  It is a three-piece unit.  A removable filter sits inside the reusable K-cup which has a top that screws on.  Also, the Keurig brewer's filter holder has to be removed in order to insert the Keurig Reusable Filter.  There is always the possibility that this filter holder could be damaged or lost.\n\n  On a daily basis, I've been using the Solofill Reusable K-Cup for over seven months.  It is much easier to operate and clean than the Keurig Reusable Filter.  Also, the coffee tastes just as great; I use my favorite Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored&nbsp;].  There are never any grounds in my coffee.  My only concern was that the plastic hinge that connects the lid with the reusable K-Cup's body would eventually break but it hasn't.  There are not any visible cracks, tears, shreds, etc.  It looks nearly as good as when it was given to me as a Christmas gift.  I no longer use my Keurig Reusable Filter, but I haven't thrown it away in case my Solofill Reusable K-Cup is lost or stolen.  Several times I've accidentally left it in the break room after washing it.  I could afford to buy another one.  The Solofill Reusable K-Cup costs the same as a Keurig Reusable Filter.  If you own one of the many varieties of Keurig single-serving brewing systems, then I highly recommend buying the Solofill Reusable K-Cup; it is easy to use, saves money and is very durable!\n\nJoseph B.

I've been buying nuts online for years and have had some successes and some failures; these are a 100% success.  They are huge (some competitors' are a bit smaller), whole (not that I really mind fragments but there are none to be found here) and they taste like Brazil Nuts (I've had some that must have been sharing the production line with peanuts - I love peanuts but I don't want to taste them when I'm eating Brazil Nuts).

It's hard to find good quality nuts of any kind that are unsalted.  These are first quality AND unsalted.  I eat them out of the can when I can't resist, but I mostly use them in stir-fry concoctions (the bottled sauces I use generally have way too much sodium all by themselves).  They are excellent with shrimp or with scallops.  Good stuff and the AMZN price (plus no tax and no shipping) makes them much more reasonable than local stores.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAl Dente Carba-Nada Egg Fettuccine, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI'm doing the low carb/high fat lifestyle and one of the toughest things for me was/is walking away from noodles/pasta.  I allow myself this occasionally and it is a reasonably acceptable alternative to pasta.  I've always thought of pasta as a blank slate - it tastes like whatever you put on it - but this is a little different.  It doesn't taste like anything, no matter what you put on it, but it's *there* and provides some pasta-like texture and pasta-like interest in the dish.  I do enjoy it and will continue to buy it.  If you're avoiding carbs and think you have to swear off pasta completely, this really is worth a shot.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBibigo Korean Gochujang Sauce, 11.46 Ounce, 2 Count\nReview:\nI'm all about the sauces - I claim to be able to cook but mostly I experiment with Indo-Asian condiments and noodles or vegetables and such.  If my guests like what I came up with I take the credit, otherwise I blame the sauce I snuck in on them.\n\nOther reviewers have already pointed out that this is pretty thick - it's not a paste but it's definitely not watery thin, and it's not oily thin either (think of sesame oil or chili oil - it's not like that).  To my taste, both the sweet and spicy elements are right there prominently in your face without a lot of subtlety which suits me just fine.  There is a slight smokiness to the flavor and it has a pretty spicy kick for a finish so there's more to it than just fire and sugar.\n\nI love hot stuff and can deal with quite a bit of heat, but I must say this would be a little over the top as the only sauce in, say, a stir fry.  The heat builds as you keep eating and it will get your attention.  (Lest you assume I'm a wimp, I'm the guy who brings his own chili oil/chili paste to the Asian buffet when a group of coworkers go out for lunch.)\n\nI marinated some raw shrimp in it before steaming with veggies and sticky rice and that was a perfect use for it.  It's also great as a flavor variation if you like doctoring up ramen noodles as I do sometime.  But my favorite use so far is to add it to pizza - it enhances pretty much any variation.  I was an early adopter of Sriracha sauce for this purpose, 20+ years ago, and I completely burned out on that stuff a long time back.  This has about the same punch but a completely different taste that works with old-school pepperoni and red sauce, chicken and white sauce, olive oil based pizza, veggie, you name it.  Just a bit here and there as an enhancement and you can transform what was an excellent pizza pie into a completely different, but still excellent pizza pie.  A two-fer!\n\nOne caveat: Gochujang is a Korean staple, not an exotic rarity.  You can buy it in paste form for a lot less and mix up your own version of this sauce with, e.g., sesame oil and soy sauce and a few other odds and ends.  It's a convenience item and if you buy this product you are paying a premium for the convenience.\n\nI racked my brain to justify fewer than 5 stars because this is a Vine review of a free product, the presence of which appears to cause some folks all kinds of heartburn.  Apparently the only proper atonement for receiving a review sample at no cost is to despise the product you're reviewing, but I think this stuff is really tasty so...five stars.

The color is a little more custard-y yellow than blonde as I remember my father's version, but that's no big deal.  Would be 5 stars if they doubled the amount of caramel sauce included in each box - it's tasty, but there could be more of it!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBar Harbor Sauce, Red Clam, 10.5 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI'm a single guy who likes to eat well and watch my weight at the same time, but I'm a lazy chef so I look for shortcuts like this.  I sauteed some shrimp in 1 can of this (1 can = 300 calories, supposedly 10 servings - hah!).  Right at the end I added a healthy dollop of cooking sherry and a goodly sprinkle of nutmet.  Served it over a 90-second-microwave bag of brown & wild rice in a bowl with a microwave bag of frozen mixed veggies on the side and that made a very fine meal with minimal prep and minimal cleanup.  A sprinkle of sliced green onions on top at serving is a good idea, but the reader should know that I sprinkle green onions on just about everything but breakfast cereal.  If you count grits and/or oatmeal as breakfast cereal, then I use green onions on breakfast cereal too.\n\nI got the idea about adding the sherry and nutmeg from a review on another site which pointed out that even though sherry is one of the ingredients, it cooks off immediately and was undetectable in the product.  I tasted it and agreed, so added the sherry at the last minute.  The same reviewer recommended the nutmeg so I added that too.\n\nI've looked at recipes for \"real\" Newburg sauce and I know it's better, but I also know I'm too lazy to make up a short shelf life batch myself.  I also know if I went out and ordered fill-in-the-blank Newburg at a restaurant I'd pay north of $40 for the plate.  This works for me; I'll be ordering it again.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPanda Sauce For Broccoli Beef, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis is a good base for doctoring up with multiple ingredients, and it works just as well if you just throw in some stew beef and broccoli florets.

They were too expensive at $5+ a box, so I grabbed 2 of these instead.\n\nThey're thin, crunchy, and super tasty. We like these better because they're airy. Mary's is too dense. Made with wholesome ingredients, I don't have to feel bad about eating these as a snack. There aren't any ingredients you can't pronounce, and I feel good that they're high quality ingredients-- certified gluten-free and non-GMO verified.\n\nOne serving is 140 calories, with 45 of them being fat. Sodium content is low at 5% of your daily recommended intake, while giving you 8% of your daily fiber.\n\nI've also tried the Sea Salt flavor, but didn't like it as much. The Original is a lot better, in my opinion. First, the shape is more fun (hexagons) and it's flavored with tamari soy sauce. The sesame taste is also very pronounced.\n\nI got them from Stop & Shop for $2.50 a bag on sale. I'll gladly buy these again. Currently, they are available on AmazonFresh for the same price. Kids love these too.

It's very sweet and tasty, but there's little or no nutritional value in here, despite being made from oats. The product is heavily processed and definitely what anyone would call healthy. Made with natural and artificial flavors, the ingredients list is very long (see bottom of review). It's loaded with sugar and not something you want to give yourself or your kids on a regular basis. Note how many times sugar or its variants appear in the list (glucose, fructose).\n\nEach bar is 1.23 oz. Daily value: Fiber 1g (5%), Vitamin A (0%), Vitamin C (0%), Calcium (10%), Iron (2%). 150 calories per bar (40 from fat), 11g of sugar. I'm giving the product 4 stars based on taste and texture. It's chewy, but not hard like Nature Valley granola bars.\n\nIngredients: granola (whole grain rolled oats, whole grain rolled wheat, brown sugar, sunflower oil, high fructose corn syrup, dried coconut, honey, sodium bicarbonate, natural flavor, whey and whey protein concentrate), yogurt flavored coating (sugar, palm kernel and palm oil, whey protein concentrate, yogurt flavored powder, soy lecithin, natural flavor, artificial color, citric acid, salt), corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, brown rice crisp (whole grain brown rice, sugar, malted barley flour, salt), brown sugar, glycerin, vegetable shortening (canola oil, palm and palm kernel oils), corn flakes (milled corn, sugar, salt, malted barley extract), whey mineral concentrate, oat flour, rice flour, sweetened dried strawberries (glucose syrup, strawberries, high fructose corn syrup, modified potato starch, sodium alginate), corn syrup solids, sorbitol, salt, sugar, modified food starch, soy lecithin, natural flavor, malted barley flour, sodium bicarbonate, BHT (a preservative), citric acid, water.\n\nMade in Canada.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nThai Kitchen Gluten Free Green Curry Paste, 4 oz\nReview:\nI used to buy this Thai Kitchen red curry paste when I was in college. Sadly, the recipe seems to have changed. It lacks flavor and intensity.

(Several varieties are co-mingled on this page.) *\n\nWe didn't like this pancake mix. In terms of ease, the instructions say to just add water, but the resulting taste is not very good if you do just that. My wife and I made them several times over the last week and were not satisfied with the flavor and texture. She said they were \"mushy\". I didn't like that they weren't fluffy. They are dense and too elastic, but not in a good way. This is owing to the potato starch and cassava starch in the recipe. When I made them, one side looked wrinkly when I flipped them prematurely, due to how potato starch cooks.\n\nTo me, pancakes should be airy and spongey. Good pancakes sop up the syrup poured on top of them. These don't do that. Making them with eggs greatly improves the appearance and taste, but they're still not as good as all flour pancakes.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Almonds, Bold Habanero BBQ, 16 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThe heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.\n\nSatisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.\n\nBlue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHEALTH WARRIOR Chia Bars, Acai Berry, Gluten Free, Vegan, 25g bars, 15 Count\nReview:\n<div id=\"video-block-RZQLT3NBPIU1U\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1a0o5EDn2S.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gG8Aia54S.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not a huge fan of snack bars like Clif Bars, but I love these. Chia seeds may seem like the latest health food craze, but they've actually been eaten for thousands of years by peoples in Meso-America. Valued for their dense nutritional content, they were an important food crop for the Mayans, not just the stuff covering tacky terracotta heads. I've been eating them for a number of years for their high protein content, fiber, and high levels of plant-based Omega-3 fatty acids. Acai berry is another health food supplement additive. It's been around for longer (mostly for use in juices and shakes) and many people have heard of it, even if just by name. They are native to South America and grow on palm trees like a huge cluster of grapes. It's much better tasting than the coffee one, in my opinion. The coffee one doesn't taste much like coffee (or a really weak coffee).\n\nI love the way these bars are moist, with a satisfyingly dense and chewy mouth-feel. Chia seeds themselves don't have much of a taste, but they provide a lot of crunchy texture like poppy seeds or sesame seeds. The taste of the bar is tart and sweet, and all in balance.\n\nI don't think they're ideal for intense sports activity unless you have water readily available, however, due to the nature of how chia seeds interact with liquid (e.g. saliva) in your mouth. After finishing the bar, you may feel some loose residual seeds just kind of hanging out in your mouth. They will require sloshing out with water to clean up. For me, they don't get stuck in my teeth, but feeling around with my tongue, there are loose seed particles around the inside the mouth like the cheek pockets. That's a natural property of chia seeds themselves and not a fault of this product since chia seeds swells in water and form a sticky, gelatinous outer coating.\n\nMy only problem with this product is how expensive it is for how small it is. That's partly a result of high demand for chia seeds, which has sent prices quadrupling or more since I started eating them 4 years ago.\n\nI do love these bars and don't feel guilty eating them because they are so packed with nutrients.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Honey Roasted Peanuts, Golden Roast, 14 oz\nReview:\nI'm not sure you need to read a review on peanuts. But here goes.\n\nWhat you see is what you get, folks. This is a jar of peanuts. Jar is plastic and recyclable, with a freshness seal under the lid to peel away. Or keep it partially attached like I do.\n\nThe nuts are in mostly halves (with a scattering of wholes), and pretty much like you see in the photo, though the image has been touched up to remove the dust that settled at the bottom of the can. The peanuts in the picture look too clean compared to the real thing. A fair percentage of the peanuts still have some of their outer skin on them. I'd say about 10% or less do. This is bonus to me, since some fiber is retained. Peanuts are high in fiber and protein.\n\nTaste is about as expected, with a good crunchiness. If you are watching your sodium intake like I am, go for the unsalted variety. The peanuts can also be ground up for things like Thai dishes or ice cream topping.\n\nLabel says \"Packed in USA\". No mention of where they are grown.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSabra, Roasted Garlic Hummus, 10 oz\nReview:\nSabra roasted garlic hummus is without a doubt my favorite flavor. I get a container of it every time I buy hummus. Sabra and Tribe are the two brands most common in my area, and I buy whichever is on special (usually 2/$5). It keeps in the fridge for up to a month, even if opened but your mileage may vary.\n\nI love it with baby carrots. I really like the large scoop of minced garlic on top. It offers a different texture so the hummus doesn't get boring.\n\nIngredients: Cooked Chickpeas (Chickpeas [Garbanzos], Water), Tahini (Ground Sesame), Soybean Oil, Garlic, Salt, Citric Acid, Red Bell Pepper, Potassium Sorbate Added to Maintain Freshness, Natural Flavors, Spices.\n\nIt's low sodium, and one tub contains 10 servings. If you ate the whole thing at once, it'd be only 700 calories and 50% of your daily salt intake. I appreciate Sabra's use on non-GMO soybean oil. Soybeans and corn are the two most heavily GMO'ed food ingredients in use today.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPOPCORNERS Cheddar Feel-Good, Popcorn Chips (5oz/12 Pack)\nReview:\nI got these on a recent Jet Blue flight and were very pleased with them. They're crunchy like nachos, but have a meatier texture. The surface of the chip has lots of bumps and bubbles that you can see and taste. They add a nice mouth-feel and crunch to the overall experience of eating these chips.\n\nOne bag has only 140 calories (35 from fat) and very low sodium (110 mg), so you can eat a whole bag without feeling much guilt. There are no artificial additives or preservatives in this product. The only comment I have is that the taste is a bit sweet because of added sugar. I prefer a stronger salt taste.\n\nPopcorners are also relatively hard to find. After having these on the flight, I looked for them at a local Boston supermarket. I only found Kettle, but none of the other flavors (butter, sea salt, white cheddar, cheesy jalapeno). An excellent and healthy snack.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPacific Foods Hazelnut Chocolate Plant-Based Beverage, 8oz, 24-pack\nReview:\nI bought a 12 pack of this after trying the Pacific Natural regular hazelnut milk.

But besides that, this milk is just delicious. Room temperature or chilled, it's equally tasty. I mixed it with coffee this morning and it's great too. I also dilute it sometimes with regular skim milk to dial down the sweetness.\n\nThe box arrives well packaged. It's a box inside a box. The inner box is bubble-wrapped for extra protection.

My first impression was that this acai berry smells very similar and almost identical to blueberry.  Acai powder is packed with goodies for your body such as antioxidant, fiber, vitamin A and C. It is a great vegan, gluten free treat and very healthy.\n\nThe powder is very dark in color. I tasted the powder raw and it's actually pretty good. Leaves a slight sweet aftertaste.\nI don't have a blender which I hope to get one soon to experiment more with this acai powder. I will mix it with yogurt next time I purchase some too.\nWhat I did here was taking:\n- 2 teaspoons of acai\n- 1 teaspoon of matcha (green tea powder)\nwith a bit of hot water. I whisk them together with a chasen and the result was a dark green colored tea. Then I added coconut milk and mixed that good. Last but not least I sprinkled a pinch of the acai powder. It seems to me that acai powder doesn't dissolve so easily and need a good whisk or blend. At the end of the last sip, I noticed some dark residue left on the bottom. It's a bit gritty or crunchy. I think it's from the seeds of the acai berry.\nThe taste is superb and healthy and it is organic as labeled.\n\n I have received a reduced price for the acai powder for testing/reviewing purposes.

And yes I did receive a discount for the matcha to test and review. All of my feedback and review are 100% honest and my own.\n\nThis organic matcha is a product of Japan and it smells absolutely amazing. Compare to the organic matcha that was product of China you can easily distinguish  the difference between them. The organic matcha from Japan smells like REAL fresh and good quality matcha. From this experience I will never buy matcha that are from China EVEN if they are organics. Compare to cooking grade matcha from China I'd say this matcha would be a ceremonial grade. LOL.\n\nThere is a notice on the back that it is best to consume the whole bag within 2 months upon opening. I might just squeeze it to 3 months because I will use this for drinking mainly since it tastes almost as good as ceremonial grade. Of course it is not ceremonial grade because you can tell by the color and smell. The color is still very green but with a slight touch of yellow. The smell is extremely green and fresh like real green tea. It took me into my imagination of nature\n\nAnyways lets get to the good part shall we. I put about a teaspoon of the matcha into a small bowl. I smooth out some of the clumps with the spoon. Slowly pour the hot water and mix until the matcha dissolves. As you can see in the last picture I added some milk to the matcha. The texture is very smooth and creamy. The taste is exceptional! I can still taste the matcha and it is very fresh.\nIf you want to drink this matcha alone, it might be bitter for you.

It is sweet but there is no added sugar. The only ingredients are banana and blueberry. It is certified organic and Non GMO. I do have to point out a whooping $20 a pouch is incredibly expensive. It's not surprising that the pouch is very light because the fruits are freeze dried.\nAlso the ratio of banana to blueberry is like 3:10 which is uncalled for. If you can afford it definitely give it a try, you won't be disappointed in taste wise.\nThe banana bits texture is similar to rice puffs or rice crispy. It is puffy and fun to bite into. While the blueberry are either crunchy or chewy.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCHOMPS Grass Fed Beef Jerky Snack Sticks, Paleo &amp; Keto Friendly, Whole30 Approved, Non-GMO Gluten &amp; Sugar Free 100 Calorie Snacks, 1.15 Ounce Stick, Pack of 24\nReview:\nLiterally just bought this jerky and it has an expiration date of 1 month.

Sweet at first sip. After taste was slightly bitter. However comparing it to the other ceremonial matcha that Ive tested it is a slightly lower quality. Therefore I gave it a 4 out of 5.\n\nIve tried drinking the matcha as it is and Ive also mixed it with yogurt which tastes amazing.\nA sifter helped out a lot so its very necessary. The best way to get rid of clumps is with a sifter AND adding the hot water little by little as you mix in the cup or bowl. You should not just pour all the hot water in at once because that would form clumps.\nI also did the same with the yogurt. I used organic whole milk yogurt (unsweetened) because it is healthy and has a very thick and creamy texture. I find that the only kind of yogurt fit for this high quality matcha. I used about 5 table spoon of the yogurt and 2 teaspoon of matcha. I sprinkled a little amount of the matcha on top of the yogurt and mix and a little more and repeat. The result is a light creamy green yogurt treat. You can add a little bit of honey and mix well.\n\nYou can consume the yogurt OR it can also be used for a face mask. Since matcha is anti-inflammatory,  high in antioxidant and full of nutrient it is perfect for treating acne. It will also give the face a natural glow.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nVanilla Bean Grinder, Whole Dried Vanilla Beans For Grinding Vanilla Powder Flakes Into Recipes, Drinks, Smoothies, Soups, Add Fresh Vanilla Flavor to Anything (2 Grinders)\nReview:\nThese bourbon vanilla beans are from Madagascar. The process is dried then cut up into small chunks.\nVanilla bean contains some minerals that the body needs, such as; magnesium, potassium and calcium. It is also known as an aphrodisiac.\n\nThe vanilla chunks itself smells very intense and appetizing. They do have a slight liquorice aroma.\nI added some to my cinnamon milk tea and I could taste the fresh vanilla flavor. I had some residue left on the bottom of my cup after finishing and I scooped the remaining powder and just ate them. They were tasty and a bit chewy.\nI noticed that vanilla ice cream I purchased in the past had these small dark particles are actually the same as what Im getting right now. These vanilla chunks will come handy for upcoming Summer treats.\n\nNotice that there is a built in grinder. Its a simple and convenient to grind the chunks into fine powder. Sometimes when I grind the chunks, I get a couple pieces that I can chew on. Its not the best grinder but its really convenient. The way I use the grinder is just like traditional pepper shaker that has a grinding mechanism on the bottom. You twist a couple times facing down and viola.\nIf you want to get more of a powder consistency you might want to use a different grinder or do it manually with mortar and pestle.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRigoni Di Asiago Nocciolata Organic Hazelnut Spread, Cocoa and Milk, 9.52 Ounce Jar\nReview:\nI recently heard of this organic hazelnut spread and went off to find one.

I usually don't like to overdose on anything but I think I overate a little of the spread, raw.\nIt is slight chunky.

It's cheap and contains 40 pouches, so I bought it.\n\nI grabbed 2 pouches after I had my lunch because I Was craving something sweet. I ate the first pouch without looking at the gummy twice.\nThey were very sticky and I had a hard time trying to get it off my teeth. Also  very sweet and yummy. I opened the second pouch. My first gummy from that pouch was a grape gummy and it was good too. The second gummy was an apple shaped and it HAD SOMETHING INSIDE. It looked like something orange because it's inside the gummy.. I flipped out and took out my phone to take photos of it.\nOMG ARE YOU FLIPPING SERIOUS. I don't know what it is pull the gummy and inside was this white powder with some green residue. It look disgusting. WHAT IF IT'S FUNGUS OR SOMETHING. I was so shocked because this is only my second pouch from the 40 others.

I had to taste them as soon as I opened the package and I am pleasantly surprised!  They taste fresh and delicious!  Chopped uniformly and not too fine.  These walnuts are recipe ready.  I like the size of the package because I have no fear that I will be able to use them before they go bad.  They are also okay for storing in the freezer.  The resealable bag stands on its own, so there is less risk of spillage when you are using them or just eating from the bag.  These walnuts only have 4 grams of carbohydrates per serving and 2 grams of fiber which makes them perfect for anyone on a low carb diet.  I will be purchasing more Fisher nuts!

The nut is excellent.  It is basically good mixed nuts.  The dried fruits taste great.  They aren't too sweet, so even though I am diabetic I was able to eat them without my blood sugar going up too much.  Sweetened fruits can have a negative effect on me.  The yogurt drops don't taste like traditional yogurt, in my opinion they taste like white chocolate.  This is the best trail mixes that I have ever tried.  I would like to continue getting this.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTruvia Spoonable Natural Stevia Sweetener, 9.8 oz Jar\nReview:\nI have been using sugar substitutes for years.  This is the first time that I have tried Truvia.  I use Erythritol and Stevia separately a lot.  I like the taste of both even though Erythritol can have a cool aftertaste.  This is excellent for sweetening hot beverages.  It tastes good and melts quickly.  My only problem with it is that it doesn't melt easily in cold beverages.  I use this in my coffee and hot tea, but I don't like to use it in any cold beverages because there is usually a undissolved residue in the bottom.  This is a very good sugar substitute and I like the convenience of the spoonable container.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy - Energizes and Supports Focus - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\nIf you love mint, then you will like this tea.  If you only like mint as an added flavor note, then this may be a bit too intense for you.  I enjoyed the flavor.  I had not had mint tea before, but I love lots of different teas.  I was surprised at how much it reminded me of eating food with chewing gum in your mouth if you eat anything with it.  I like mine sweet and it isn't bad with lemon if you like it that way.  The mint is dominant and strong, so it may not be suited to all tastes.  I didn't really get an energy burst from it, so I can't really comment on how that feels.  I probably wouldn't regularly buy it, but it isn't bad.  If you like mint, give it a try.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAmazon Brand - Happy Belly Sweetened Dried Mango Slices, 12 Ounce Pack of 2\nReview:\nThese are very good quality dried mango slices.  The slices clearly come from ripe fruit that is process while fresh.  The texture is chewy and flexible instead of tough like some other brands.  The slices are also large rather than chopped up which makes them perfect for eating alone and easily chopped to add to other things.  The only problem that I have with them is the amount of sugar that they are coated in.  Mangoes are already a naturally sweet fruit and with so much sugar added they become more like eating candy than a good healthy treat.  My husband loves mangoes, but he thinks that these are too sweet.  We prefer less sugar on dried fruits in general and I like to get them unsweetened when possible.  Happy Belly has high quality products, so I would recommend that you give these a try if you like dried mangoes.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nCarrington Farms Gluten Free, Unrefined, Cold Pressed, Virgin Organic Coconut Oil, 54 oz.

Alas, those days are gone -- the insect and bird brands serve up fragmented grayish mush as often as not.

Jars Pack of 6\nReview:\nThe quality is beyond dispute -- this is true Costa Rican Tuna Ventresca, in nice clean solid fillets the way it was meant to be.  The bottle is topped-off with olive oil, which is fine with me, though some might want to drain the fishy oil off before serving.\n\nThe only negative I see is the slight-to-moderate saltiness of the product: personally, I crave salt constantly, so this is a non-issue for me.  But those who dislike salt (be it for health reasons or mere taste), these *might* be a little too much salt-wise.\n\nOne last point: like all well-packed tuna, you can expect the expiration date of the product to be 1-2 years from the day you receive it, and it is truly fine up to that very date.  But once you open the bottle?  Things are much different.  Guidelines basically suggest that tuna begins spoiling about three days after opening, assuming refrigeration of course.  But unless you completely forget about the half-eaten tuna. that is plenty of time for even the lightest of eaters (a small cat, say) to polish off this delicacy.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTabasco Habanero Pepper Sauce, 5 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nAssuming you're a hot hot sauce fan, and can handle the vivid character of Tabasco Habanero, it's excellent on just about anything but ice cream.  The first time I had it (like 10-15 years ago), I remember used about two drops on a burrito and couldn't even go to work the next day, but now a couple of teaspoons per meal really hits the spot.  This is a pretty unique product, since it not only has actual classic Tabasco sauce in it for that beloved old-time hot flavor, plus a generous amount of Habanero peppers: it's actually a Jamaican style sauce.  That means that it has all this sweet, mild tropical fruity stuff in it, like bananas and mangoes, and then adds Habanero liquid electric fire to put a Caribbean blaze into almost any possible food.  Seriously, if I was forced to eat a cardboard box, with enough of this condiment, I would probably enjoy it.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['good', 'flavor', 'like', 'get', 'product', 'really', 'one', 'fine', 'fresh', 'little']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nPS Seasoning &amp; Spices French Fry Seasoning Variety Pack 5.5 Ounces Each (5 Flavors); Steak Fry, Chili Cheese, Parmesan &amp; Garlic, Buffalo Wing, &amp; Sweet Potato - Gluten Free -No MSG - Add Great Flavor to Your Meals Without Adding Calories!\nReview:\nI was so excited to receive these!! I love adding seasonings and flavoring to my foods. I make french fries for the family at least once a week so these were perfect instead of just plain french fries with ketchup all the time. So far, I have tried the Parmesan & Garlic and the Sweet Potato on french fries. They were both delicious. The sweet potato one tastes a lot like the actual sweet potato fries you would order in a restaurant. The Parmesan & Garlic was just delicious but we are a garlic loving family so I expected nothing less than to love it. I also tried the Buffalo Wing one but I actually sprinkled and mixed some into my bread crumbs when I breaded boneless chicken breast. It wasn't an overpowering taste of barbecue, but it added a really good taste to it. These are going to be great to just play around with and add to many different things and the 5 different ones that come with this set, gives me to opportunity to do so. I'm looking forward to trying them on some grilling as a seasoning for my meats. We also make homemade potato chips and thought they would be great to sprinkle on those as well since they are perfect for french fries. I was very impressed with these and me and my family are LOVING them!! I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

All you do is take a frying pan and put an inch of oil in, when oil is hot at about 350 drop these little wafers in and they will instantly grow to 3 to 4 times their size. They poof up and that is it, just remove them from oil and serve. Be careful to not make oil too hot as these burn easily.

When opening it , it has a strong smell much like soap or perfume. I tasted it straight up and thought it was weird and not something I would like. I then decided to make rice with it.  I used 2 cups of this with 1 cup Basmati rice and about 1/2 lb of  peeled raw shrimp, 1 tablespoon freeze dried shallots(Harmony house brand) , threw everything in pan and cooked it for the 10-15 minutes that the rice needed and wow!  It came out excellent! The flavor of coconut is there along with cilantro and slight hint of curry and tiny bit of heat.\n\nI also used this as a base for an Indian chicken curry and have to say it made it much better than usual. I prefer the Indian style curry to Thai and this is just perfect in it. As a soup base I would recommend equal parts of homemade chicken stock as this stuff is overpowering otherwise. By the way I used Patak's mild curry paste with this. You can spice it up and add more heat as you like as the others are just too hot for my taste. The price is right and I like this size, you can refrigerate the leftovers or freeze it in small container.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNongShim Bowl Noodle Soup, Spicy Shrimp, 3.03 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nOK, not as good as the spicy seafood one.

It is very flavorful and has already become a favorite at our house.  It is also a good tea to mix with black or green tea if you want to add some caffeine.  Since it's caffeine-free, it's very versatile.  It might even make a good lemonade style cold drink.  I'll test it out.\nHappy Sipping!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Kashi Vive Probiotic Digestive Wellness Cereal, 12-Ounce Box (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI tested out this cereal this morning. The taste was fine. It didn't have a lot of appealing crunch to it, however - more of a dull crunch. I would like to see if Kashi offers a similar cereal with more protein, since I found that this cereal actually made me hungry in a shorter period of time as compared with when I eat a piece of toasted Mestemacher whole grain German bread (also available on Amazon)slathered with Smart Balance and ground chia seeds (lots of good fat).  The serving size of Kashi Vive is 1 1/4 cups with 170 calories per serving, 12 grams of fiber, 2.5 grams of fat, 10 grams of sugar and 4 grams of protein.  Total carbs are 43 grams with net carbs of 31 grams, so still a healthy dose of carbs.  Mestemacher sunflower seed bread in comparison is densely packed with whole grains, 140 calories per slice, 3 grams of fat, 0 grams of sugar, 6 grams of dietary fiber, 23 grams of carbs, so 17 grams of net carbs and 5 grams of protein. The bread also has 15% of iron which is naturally occurring due to the whole grains.  By comparison, Kashi Vive has 8% of RDA of iron and 20% each of calcium and Vitamin D.  It has whole grain and sesame flour, but is not 100% whole grain.  It also contains wheat bran, rice and yellow corn meal.\n\nIt's all about moderation, and this cereal is great as another means of adding fiber, calcium and Vitamin D to your diet.  You may find this cereal at your local Big Lots for $2.80 per box.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWholesome Organic Raw Blue Agave Nectar, Syrup, Low Glycemic Sweetener, Non GMO, 23.5 oz (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI have been using Raw Agave Nectar as a sweetener almost exclusively for a number of months now.  I am even enrolled in the automatic subscription program, however I am in the process of re-thinking my decision. First off, there is quite a bit of information on the Internet that points to the fact that agave nectar is really a manufactured  and not a naturally occurring product - agave syrup - and that it is really a form of high fructose syrup.  There is also a concern about the plant source and how it could be potentially harmful to some individuals.  This product is expensive, and if you use it regularly, you may find that you are using quite a bit even if it is sweeter than sugar.  And if you are using a lot, shouldn't you be concerned about what you are really ingesting?\nGo to [...] for some insight into this.  Could it be that the sweetener that I have grown to love (and it tastes great - like a maple syrup substitute) and that I use primarily throughout the day in tea and in yogurt/kefir is worse for me or no better than table sugar?  Should I be frowning when my son uses pancake syrup and I choose to use raw agave \"nectar\"?\nI guess the old saying still rings true - if it sounds or tastes too good to be true, then maybe it just isn't as good as it appears to be.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nTofu Shirataki Noodles 10 Bags Angel Hair Shape\nReview:\nI bought 3 pasta shape varieties of these 8 oz. 2-serving bags of noodles in liquid in the refrigerated tofu section of our local grocery store for $1.99 per bag yesterday.  I am puzzled how they can be sold and shipped since the front of the bag states \"perishable - keep refrigerated\".  I opened the bag and smelled the noodles, and they did have a rather strange, strong odor.  I immediate poured the noodles into a strainer and then rinsed them under cold water.  I put them in a sauce pan with a small amount of Lorivo expeller-pressed peanut oil and let them sit for a while, stirring occasionally.  I decided to add Guilin chili sauce, garlic powder, powdered ginger, a small amount rice vinegar, water, 3 - 4 tsp. coconut sap sugar and 1/2 large can drained bean sprouts.  I warmed this mixture for awhile - maybe 20 or more minutes.  It worked!  I created a palatable side dish with a good- tasting broth and appealing consistency.\n\nI served this side dish with broiled tuna, mahi mahi, and a Spring greens salad mix with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.\nI wish that these noodles were available in larger sized bags at a lower price per serving, but $1 per person for two modest serving sizes per bag isn't outrageous unless you compare this with the cost of regular pasta.  I added the bean sprouts because the noodles alone didn't look like enough food for 3 people, and I thought that adding bean sprouts would offset any texture issues with the noodles. This recipe has now worked out twice with no real concern about cooking time for the noodles. Maybe the vinegar is the key, but the noodles are just like any other noodles when prepared this way and they make a great noodles with Asian-style broth meal or side dish.  And finally ... a use for those canned bean sprouts!\n\nUpdate:  I have now mixed these with baked tofu and Asian-style sauce. That combo worked out great.  Also I took the wide noodles, rinsed them and then put them in spaghetti sauce to simmer.  They tasted fine. Texture-wise, they will always be somewhat slimy and slippery and not al dente like well-prepared pasta, but otherwise, they worked out well. Just remember - just 40 calories - in an entire bag! And next to no carbohydrates!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNature's Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil- Pure, Cold-pressed, Organic, Non-GMO, Gluten-free- 16 Ounce\nReview:\nThis coconut oil is an excellent multi-purpose product.  I have used it for cooking, broiling, eating by the spoonful and as a skin moisturizer and massage oil.\nLast night I put a few pats of this coconut oil on salmon with a salt and herb mix.  I broiled the salmon and it tasted amazing.  The coconut oil definitely enhanced the flavor.\nI have been using this oil for frying eggs as well.  It does not seem to burn as quickly as olive oil or butter and it also seems that less is needed for frying - probably since it's easier to use small amounts since it is in solid form.\nThis coconut oil also worked well for sauteing tofu and broccoli with Bragg's liquid unfermented soy.\nIt's also tasty on a baked potato and I find that I can skip the salt and still enjoy the flavor.  You can also add it to rice or rice and beans or french fries for a tropical splash of flavor.\nI combined this coconut oil with olive oil to saute vegetables for a pasta dish and it worked beautifully.\nIt has mild, fresh flavor and a little seems to go a long way.\n\nApril 19, 2012\n\nStill loving this coconut oil.  It tastes great so you could literally eat a spoonful or two if you were hungry and needed instant energy.\nI packed it for a trip to Florida.  It was solid when I arrived, but liquified once I hit the warmer weather.\nIt also works great in a hot bath for instant moisturizing and it's the perfect after sun moisturizer.  It smells so good that you could use it as a very mild perfume and moisturizer just by rubbing it into your arms and legs until the oil is absorbed - seriously!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHealthworks Chia Seeds Raw Pesticide-Free, 2lb\nReview:\nThe chia seed is probably one of the most versatile, nutrition-packed, economical diet foods available. There are virtually no side effects - all of the good and none of the bad.  You can make chia gel to store in your refrigerator and eat alone or mixed with yogurt or other food.  The chia seeds will keep you from feeling hungry and provide an excellent source of hydration and sustained energy.  You can also add chia seeds to salad dressing or sprinkle them on foods.  Chia seed gel is tasteless so it can be used as a fat substitute for baking as well.  Chia seeds can also be added to fruit smoothies as a high fiber, low-carb source of protein and good fat.  Wouldn't it  also make sense to keep a package of chia seeds in your car (well-wrapped of course) along with water in the event that you were stranded?  Unlike flax seeds, chia seeds should not go rancid if kept dry.  Chia seeds as compared with flax seed contain more nutrients and have no offensive taste or odor.  Raw Food World offers a very good value for purchasing in small and medium quantities.  The double-wrap packaging is excellent and re-usable, the chia seeds are food-grade clean and fresh, and delivery is very prompt.  Check out the Aztec history of chia seeds.  A great addition to your \"good fat\" or \"nut and seed\" diet!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBragg Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar, 128 Ounce - 1 Pack\nReview:\nHi, I had read about the benefits of raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar for years and finally decided to try some several days ago.  After a few days of usage (and this could be coincidental, but unlikely), the psoriasis behind my ears and in my ears has gone away and the psoriasis on my scalp has virtually disappeared as well. I did use a small amount of topical cream on my forehead, but nowhere else.  I have a fairly mild case, but this could be a breakthrough for combatting this skin disease I've lived with since I was a teenager.  I am not sure if I can at this time say that apple cider vinegar helps with psoriasis, but it's worth a try.  My psoriasis continues to stay very \"subdued\" since I have been using the ACV, but I am also limiting my intake of yeast-containing and wheat products to see if this also contributes to psoriasis flare-ups.  I have not wanted to take any drugs for my psoriatic arthritis and I have used any creams very sparingly often going for months without using anything.  The other interesting thing about apple cider vinegar (called ACV) is that it doesn't seem to upset my stomach as you would think it might when mixed with water and a little agave nectar or ground stevia leaf.  I can even take it at night before bed.  I usually mix a tablespoon in about a cup or more of water, add some natural sweetener and drink it down. It's actually refreshing, and has a similar taste in my opinion to kombucha.  I then rinse my mouth out with water as a precaution to prevent tooth enamel erosion.  Today I mixed ACV with Bragg's Liquid Aminos in some stirfry.  It was tangy and tasty.  Check out all the blogs about ACV and psoriasis among other things.  There is a theory that people with psoriasis have too much alkalinity and ACV corrects that.  If you don't drink mass quantities, it can't hurt you, and, who knows, it might \"cure what ails ya\".  Good Luck!  I will follow with an update. Please note that you need to buy apple cider vinegar with the \"mother\" such as Bragg if you are going to ingest it - not inexpensive store shelf apple cider vinegar that you find in the condiments section.  Bragg is very reasonably priced in larger quantities.  Note:  I just received my order from the Vitamin Shoppe, and vinegar in the large gallon plastic bottle somehow leaked out some in the cardboard box onto the enclosed brochures.  I called Vitamin Shoppe and they are providing a replacement immediately.\n\nUpdate:  I used the apple cider vinegar, but after several days - and maybe it was because I was on the phone while I was eating  very hot applesauce -  my throat became raw and sore, so I decided to discontinue the cider vinegar for a few days not knowing if hot foods and liquids were the culprit or the addition of vinegar to my diet - always diluted and no more than a tablespoon in water 1 to 2 times per day.  I will try the vinegar again soon, but I will be curious to know if anyone else experiences the same thing. I drink a lot of hot tea, but I have been cooling it down some.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Gluten Free Hearty Whole Grain Bread Mix, 20-ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nUpdate:  I have now worked with this bread mix several times and I have reached the decision that it is just not versatile enough for creative bakers like myself who love to improvise and have a base from which to work, but still not feel limited in terms of options.  The addition of onions and caraway seeds to this mix severely limits the options and appeal of this bread mix.  I managed to sift out the caraway seeds and sesame seeds, but still some of the caraway seeds got through.  I love caraway seeds, but for some reason, the caraway seeds are overpowering in this mix. Adding onion was also too limiting. Onion powder can easily be added by the person making the bread.  I had a bit of success making a loaf of savory bread.  I used baking powder, ground canned chick peas, eggs and some herbs and a small amount of parmesan cheese.  At least it's edible and it will make a good side bread.\n\nI also added grated zucchini and that made the bread moist. Overall it's probably one of the better ways to use this mix of which\n have three more packages.  But again, I sifted out many of the seeds.\nOriginal Review:  I bought this mix at a reduced price at our local Natural Food Market. I was looking for options for making Gluten free muffins and bread. This morning I prepared blueberry muffin mix the same way I usually do with an additional egg and the muffins rose perfectly.  My husband and I detected a different flavor to the muffins and when I read the packaging it said that there were caraway seeds in the mix.  The flavor and texture of the muffins is very complex, dense and intriguing.  I like the nuttiness of the texture. The muffins came out a rich brown color and seem suitable for the coming colder weather. Who is only after I read the reviews here that I found out that that the mix contains onion powder. That's honestly a little disappointing because it would make a much more versatile mix if the onion powder was left to the individual taste preference and could be added into the mix when preparing the bread or muffins or whatever. The consensus isn't in yet as to whether or not the majority of people would like the taste of these muffins but I rather like the taste and the hearty texture.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['mix', 'also', 'good', 'bread', 'oil', 'per', 'seeds', 'flavor', 'small', 'would']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nGood Earth Green Tea, Jasmine, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis is good tea.

Challenge: Find a decaff that is satisfying. Answer: Caribou decaff! I really enjoyed the regular version of Caribou (with caffeine). So, I thought, maybe take a shot at the decaff version?\n\nI have tried a number of decaff K-cup coffees. Some have been okay whereas others were pretty weak and didn't have a smooth taste. Caribou has a good coffee taste and is very satisfying. Overall, this represents one of my favorite decaffs for my Keurig coffee makers. Thus, Caribou is satisfying in both the regular and decaff versions.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPeet's Coffee Major Dickason Blend Single Cup Coffee for Keurig K-Cup Brewers 40 count\nReview:\nA very nice blend! It does have a complex flavor, as advertised. The side panel notes: \"Rich, complex, multi-layered; like a relationship with an old friend.\" Apparently,  Key Dickason was a regular patron of the original Peet's cafe. He shared his own blend of coffee with Mr. Peet; the blend was tweaked and here you have the result!\n\nThe flavor is complex and rich. This is a deep roast coffee--which I like.\n\nI judge this to be one of the best K-cups that I have tried.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWolfgang Puck Coffee, Chef's Reserve Colombian Decaf (Medium Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nOur Keurig coffee maker was a great Christmas gift last year. One of the pleasures of this device is the experimentation with various coffee blends. Some have worked well; others have not. Some are too mild; some are a bit \"off\" on taste.\n\nThis Wolfgang Puck product is one of the more successful experiments with the Keurig machine. It has a rich taste and still remains smooth. Not too strong a flavor, but it does have flavor.\n\nSo, the two coffee drinkers in my household are quite pleased to drink this brew.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['taste', 'product', 'one', 'coffee', 'nice', 'good', 'pretty', 'heat', 'use', 'like']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nGarden of Eatin' Black Bean Corn Tortilla Chips, 7.5 oz.

Some of the family loved these and say they are worthy of 5 stars.  I find them too rich.  They are not bad.  They are just not my taste preference.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the very crunchy style of cheese straws made by Trader Joe's or John Macy's (both of which are available on Amazon).  They, too, are very cheesy with a nice bite of heat, but they are not as rich and heavy in taste or texture.  Mom likes their taste, but prefers the softer texture of the shortbread-style straws.

These shrimp are sustainably wild caught so you don't have to worry about shrimp raised in a cesspool of antibiotics, bacteria etc.  They are wonderful and the price is right.\n\nI noticed a lot of reviews mentioning a fishy taste.  Because canned shrimp are cooked during the canning process they can taste very strong.  Canned shrimp should always be rinsed!  Empty into a fine mesh collander and *gently* rinse under nice cool water.  Shake gently a couple times and then tap them out on a couple of clean paper towels.  The flavor of these when rinsed is absolutely 5 stars.

Oregon Fruit Products has been in business for many years and (I believe) they are committed to high quality.

Most of us know that MSG occurs naturally in several foods we eat (tomatoes being one of them). There is a big difference between the MSG that occurs naturally in food and the MSG that is created in a lab to make things \"taste good\" (Even rotten meat can be made to taste good when sprinkled with chemically produced MSG).  When an item occurs naturally in a food, most of the time it can be used properly by our bodies (Sugars in fruits and vegetables for instance).  If you are someone who is avoiding *added* chemically derived excitotoxins/neurotoxins which some studies have shown to cause headaches, gall bladder problems along with a plethora of other symptoms you might not want to purchase this curry.  If you don't have a problem with MSG and are one of the many that claims \"I'm going to die of something anyway\" then this product might be \"just what the doctor ordered\".  For me, unfortunately, I had to end up throwing this away after reading the label.  I make almost 100% of what I eat from scratch from ingredients I have sourced but thought this might be a nice treat... my mistake.

Leaving the germ and bran layer intact intensifies its fragrance and nutty flavor while retaining the highest nutritional value. This nourishing whole grain rice has a lovely supple texture - unlike the chewy and bland taste of some brown rice.\n\nPerfect in dishes that will showcase its delicate fragrance, Mekong Flower is nutritious and flavorful.\n\nPerfect for all cuisines, it can be used steamed plain, in a pilaf, stir-fry, salad or pudding.\n\nMekong Flower is chiefly grown on small family plots by households belonging to the Damrei Romeal Organic Rice Cooperatives in Takeo, a province dominated by rice fields and sugar palm trees. Cooperative members are using a set of growing methods, called the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), which enable smallholder farmers to harvest more rice from their traditional varieties using less water, seed, land and no chemicals. Researchers have found that the major aromatic compound in rice is increased in response to water stress. With SRI, farmers drain their paddies periodically, which may explain why Cambodian consumers are saying that SRI-grown 'Phka Malis' is more aromatic and better tasting. Visit our SRI section to learn more about this amazing system that is transforming the rice-growing world.\n\n# Cooks in 30 minutes\n# Whole grain and heart healthy\n# High in fiber, trace minerals and vitamins\n# High in phytonutrients and antioxidants\n# 3rd year transition, organic certification\n# Fair trade\n# Gluten and wheat free\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

That being said, I tried this Mac & Cheese made with rice pasta and was seriously underwhelmed.\n\nFor one thing, there weren't that many servings, especially if you are making this a main part of your meal.  Secondly, the cheese mix was very bland.  I had to doll it up with pepper and even some garlic salt before I could eat any of it.  Even then...there is no way this tastes in any way, shape, or form like regular Mac & Cheese.\n\nThe rice pasta cooked up nicely, which is a plus, but I would never use the cheese mix again.  So I guess I might as well, at that point, buy my own rice pasta and mix up my own cheesy mixture to go over it.  Takes more work, but why use something convenient like Mac & Cheese in a box if you don't end up enjoying the end product?\n\nDefinitely a pass.  Sadly.  If Annie's takes it back to the drawing board and makes the cheesy mix something tastier I would be willing to give it a second try.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\n Peanut Butter &amp; Co.

The white chocolate flavor paired with the peanut butter is marvelous.  However, if you are looking for an overwhelming chocolate flavor then this might not be for you, because its a subtle mix.\n\nI've used this on waffles, pancakes, toast, crackers and even made wraps out of it.  You really don't need to add jam when you use this flavored peanut better.  In fact, except for raspberry, jams don't always go with this flavor combo.\n\nThe peanut butter is nice and smooth and not too sugary.

I also bought the White Chocolate one at the same time.  I actually prefer the White Chocolate flavor slightly over this one, but the maple-flavored peanut butter is pretty good.  I think it's actually tad sweeter tasting than the white chocolate one.\n\nI have used this on toast, in wraps, and on crackers.

The only thing I find missing with this one (and the other) is that I tend to like crunchy peanut butter, but for a smooth one...this comes in a close second to the Peanut Butter & Co White Chocolate in my opinion.\n\nI think the chocolate flavors might appeal more to kids, and the maple more to adults.\n\nI aim to try this one out when making peanut butter candy for the holiday season.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Lakewood Organic PURE Black Cherry Juice, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nThis black cherry juice is postively wonderful tasting.  It isn't too sweet or too tart and honestly tastes like you're eating black cherries...a terrific treat!  I also deeply appreciate that its organic and doesn't have all those added sugars like so many other juices out there.  Sure, this is more expensive, but its well worth it.\n\nCherries, like blueberries and blackberries and the like, are really really wonderful for your health.  I either drink this straight or mix it with sparkling water and make myself a tasty and good-for-you black cherry \"soda.\"  It is also a nice juice to use for making punch for a party.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTinkyada Brown Rice Pasta, Spaghetti with Spinach, 12 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI have tried many different kinds of gluten free pasta and Tinkyada absolutely makes the very best.  Not only does it cook like regular spiral pasta, but if you don't tell anyone they really can't tell its not gluten pasta.  I have a recipe I like to make that calls for spiral pasta and despaired of finding anything that would work, but I tried this one and it was great.  I took it to a picnic and, as I said, if I hadn't told the people it was gluten free (for my gluten free friends) they wouldn't have known.\n\nThis gluten free spiral pasta also does come in the veggie colored spirals, which is how I make a favorite pasta dish.  But it works just as well with these regular spirals, if not looking quite so colorful.\n\nI cook these spiral noodles as recommended on the package, but I also pull some out to check for the appropriate level of doneness, as I prefer them not to be mushy.  Rinse them off and cool down and add your chopped veggies, olives, pickled artichokes, maybe some pepperoni and onions, etc and some kind of dressing such as Italian and then you can keep in the fridge. You can also add some cheese if you want just before serving.  Makes a great potluck dish.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGlutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists, 14.1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nMy biggest problem with these pretzels is their price.  They are quite expensive for a bag of pretzels, especially in comparison to regular bags of pretzels.  That being said, my second biggest problem with these pretzels is in trying not to eat half the bag in one sitting.\n\nThese gluten free pretzels have the same texture, crunch, and flavor of regular gluten pretzels, so if you are trying to go gluten free and miss your pretzels, these are pretty much the main choice.  I eat them as is or put them out at parties when gluten free friends are coming over.  You can use them with any dip you might normally pair with pretzels.  I can also see using these to make chocolate-dipped pretzels for the holidays or as a pretzel-based crust in some desserts.\n\nI'm quite happy with these, price or not.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nGhirardelli Chocolate Baking Chips, Semi-Sweet Chocolate, 12 oz., 6 Count\nReview:\nI must admit that I also have been known to pull a bag of these out and snack on them or add a handful to vanilla ice cream.  They honestly taste great alone, but where they really shine is in your cakes, cookies, and other desserts.\n\nGhiraradelli melts nicely and has a great smooth chocolate flavor, much more subtle than Nestle or Hershey's chocolate chips.  Not that I don't enjoy Nestle or Hershey's chocolate, but Ghiraradelli seems a tad less sugar-sweet and so seems to taste more like rich dark chocolate.\n\nI sometimes mix these in with some Bittersweet chocolate chips in cookies and they are my go-to chips when melting them down to make chocolate cake batter.  I have also used these to make ganache for frosting cakes and desserts.  I've also melted down these chips to make the coating for truffles.\n\nHighly recommended.  I rarely go without a package of these in the cupboard.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWOW BAKING COMPANY Cookies, Ginger Molasses, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI've tried several of the gluten-free products from this company and I think this cookie is my favorite.  The cookies are soft, wonderfully textured, and have a great flavor.  For ginger-molasses cookies they are not overly spicy, but they have these great little tidbits of ginger inside them.  The primary flavor is a nice blend of molasses and spices, however.\n\nMy only issue with them is that, if you don't eat them right away, even with the re-sealable bag, they tend to get hard around the edges.  I didn't have that issue with the lemon cookies from this same company, so I'm not sure what gives.  They still taste great, but if you want them to be uniformly soft then eat them as soon as possible once the bag is opened.\n\nNot enough of an issue to take away a star, though, especially since so many other gluten-free choices suffer from being too dry and these cookies start out so moist and soft.\n\nVery much recommended...\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'good', 'chocolate', 'one', 'flavor', 'also', 'taste', 'make', 'nice', 'really']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nGlucerna Crispy Delights Nutrition Bars, Chocolate Chip, 4 Count\nReview:\nthe taste was great, and it's low in sugar.

The price purchase is high-dollar.  The (hazelnut) chocolate has multiple flavors. Too many in my opinion, i.e., too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the food. The different flavors compete with each other for taste (dominance).  The nut overwhelms any chocolate and the cracked mixed nuts on the outside of the chocolate add distraction.\nIt ends up (in my opinion) as a soft (gooey) sweet 'something' with complex flavors.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nHills Bros Cappuccino, French Vanilla, 16 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIf you follow the instructions on the box, you WILL be disappointed! To make it taste as 'rich'\n as a cappuccino should taste, you have to DOUBLE the amount of mocha. It's very difficult to mix w/o making a mess. No matter how you make the brew you're going to have to break up a bunch of lumps of it; that didn't get mixed into the water, and that will cause a mess. Doing it inside a cup/mug you are going to have residue mocha marks all over the sides and top edges. You can't help it IF you wish to just drink a good cup of hot choc.\nThe best way I was able to use to accomplish the recipe w/o the mess on the sides of the mug, etc., was to put the steaming hot water in a blender, then set it on mix, putting the cappuccino slowly; you don't want the mix to hit the bottom! Once you get all the mixture in the hot water, and setting it on stir/blend, place the top on quickly and hit the fastest button you have on your blender.  Keep it there until you see no powder on the sides or the bottom, and no lumps in the water.\nI made the mixture, usng the double mixture w/hot milk, coz' if you use water, as they say, all you are going to get is muddy water (in my opinion). Right after I see the mixture is about hot choc. should look/a little 'thick' not watery, I immediately pour the mix into a mug and place the balance in a container w/easy spout and stick it in the fridge.\nWhen you take the remainder of the mixture you have left in the fridge, no matter how well you blended it, some of the cappuccino will have settled on the bottom. You will have to shake the container vigoriously, turning it upside down, then put it in your mug(s) and 'nuke'.\nA good cup of hot choc, I like, is somewhat a little thicker than milk, and leaves a froth on the top (so you can add your marshmellows; however, this brand, cappuccino, isn't going to work w/the addition.\nNow, all that I have written is what you will have to do no matter the brand name or flavor, size of mixture, etc., you are going to have the same issues that I have written.....that is what you get when you go 'instant'.\nThe ole' fashioned way of making hot choc. is my preferred method. You get your small pot, pour the milk into it and get it to boiling. Slowly had your hot chocolate. You stir in the pot using the same method I have written and you are going to have a good cup of hot choc.\nHot choc. should be made w/whole milk, but not h.and h.  Hot choc. is a cup of 'joy' for any time you wish to feel special....whether it be by yourself, wiith pet, or family. It's special. Taking the time to do it right makes the occasion even more enjoyable...if you don't hurry.

(Pack of 16)\nReview:\nIf you're planning on purchasing the Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Peppermint Cups hoping to get something as minty as a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/York-Peppermint-Patty/dp/B000NME632/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">York Peppermint Patty</a>, you might be a little disappointed. Unfortunately the mint kick in the Newman's peppermint cups is a little lacking; but otherwise the taste is actually pretty darn good. The dark chocolate shell provides a nice mild bitterness which complements the mint that is present, yet it doesn't overwhelm it like many milk chocolates do by overloading you with sweetness.\n\nEach individually wrapped packet of cups is actually filled three cups which are smaller than the cups you might find in a Reese's Peanut Butter cups package. The weight of each individual package also suggests that each serving size is smaller - the Newman's packages weigh in at 34 grams, Hershey's lists Reese's as 43g. This may be due to peanut butter weighing more than the mint goo inside of Newman's, I have no idea - but I think by volume the Newman's are simply smaller.\n\nMy batch of chocolate did have an unfortunate chalkiness which I usually associate with \"old\" chocolate - the ones that have been sitting on the shelf for a little while. The Newman's did not have any type of \"best by\" or \"made on\" date printed on the package that I could find so I have no idea if this was just how they were supposed to taste or if I did indeed get an older batch from Amazon. In either case the chalkiness was faint and didn't really detract too much from the final taste, but you did definitely get that weird powdery feeling.\n\nOk, I know this review sounds pretty negative but I don't want to leave you with that impression. Really the only issue I had with the Newman's Peppermint cups was that I really wanted them to be more pepperminty. I would compare the \"mint level\" of these cups to about the same as you would get from eating one of those red-and-white swirled peppermint hard candies (or a candy cane) - I was really hoping for something more on the level with an Altoids (or stronger) mint. This chocolate is also not for someone who's looking to curb a sweet tooth as there's really not a lot of sweetness in the cup - I suppose you would call this more of an \"adult candy\". Less on the sugar, more on the mild flavors. That being said, the mild mint and the slightly bitter dark chocolate make this an excellent candy which I can easily recommend, the USDA \"Certified Organic\" stamp is just icing on the top.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Yes, I absolutely did read the most critical review before buying but had no idea the caking problem could be sooo bad!  I don't live in a damp climate, yet not even the tiny desiccant packs that I resort to using will keep it from caking. And, yes, I know better than to sprinkle the jar's contents over steaming food.  Yet, I currently don't have onion powder in my little shaker jar, I have hard BALLS of onion powder.  I'm writing now because I found the contents of the smaller of the two larger jars I store the bulk of it in had solidified into one hard mass whose chunks I broke it into will be dissolved to go down the drain.  Actions like that defeat the purpose of buying in bulk.  Unsurprisingly, the onion powder in my main storage jar, whose lid I couldn't remove without the aid of a bottle opener, is so much better indicating this is great onion powder as long as you don't open the jar.  That makes me wonder if those who left positive reviews haven't had it very long or use it so quickly that its fine particles don't have time to enthusiastically unite in organic solidarity.\nRating:\n2.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Upon arrival, I was instantly disappointed. What? A thin foil envelope of cereal? This was a very high price point for the product.\n\n  However, I am updating my review because I want to point out that this product is sold for $8.99 on their website with a discounted price for shipping on multiple items.  That price puts it right in line with a very fair price point.  If you go through Amazon, you pay for the convenience and that's okay as well!\n\n  It was time to taste test. I got out the measuring cup and poured my first serving.  Looked okay, smelled okay.  I'm afraid it was downhill after that. I personally did not have a taste for this particular product.  My love for coconut must not be that deep!  I understand we all have our own tastes and some are acquired.

When growing up, my mom always had chips on her storm prep list. There she was getting gas, filling up containers of water, making sure there was cash in the house, etc. It always made me laugh when she purchased a bag of chips for the house! That was on her storm prep list!  During a recent hurricane, I had these sent to my sister. She was able to pass them out to neighbors who were all helping each other clean up and rebuild the destruction. They were a welcome sight! The chips were fresh and the individual bags made it so convenient!  Utz chips have been around for years and their name equals quality!

I also want to add that the price per pack is significantly less when purchased in in quantity here at Amazon. Use Subscribe and Save whenever possible for additional savings.

It was smooth, creamy and sweet-tasting an instantly dissolved in hot liquids. I used it in my coffee and organic cacao drinks and it was better than half and half or  milk, by a long shot. Then the next batch I ordered was bad, even though the expiration date was not until 2016! The cream and liquid had gone sour and curdled, meaning they separated into a pulp and clear water and the water tasted off. It would not dissolve in coffee. Amazon refunded me and I ordered another batch. It came in different packaging (and also a 2016 expiration date) but was the same pulp/water consistency and sour taste. Although very convenient in small boxes, as it lasts and does not go bad, provided it is good when you first receive it, if you only use a little each day, but watch out if you get a 25-pack order, like I did, and they are all trash. That's just a waste of time and money and an upsetting experience.

Next, put real blueberries from my freezer in to the batter. The package said their dried berries would \"plump\" up. Nope, they just sorta rode the baking process out, the same size as they went in.

Raw seeds are flexible.  Most of the time, I  just eat them raw, because I'm on a salt-restricted diet.  On the rare occasions I want them roasted, I can do that wihout adding any salt.  When making them up for guests, I can add sea salt before roasting.  That's what I mean by \"flexible\".  Raw seeds can be kept  refrigerated for 1-2 months in a tightly sealed container without loss of flavor, but frozen can be kept for a year.\n\nNot only are they flexible, but they are outstandingly good!  I use them a lot in vegetable salads, but sometimes I just eat a handful or two as a light snack. If you want to dry roast your own, here's how I do it: Heat oven to its lowest temperature(160-170 degrees F.  Spread seeds in a single layer on a cookie sheet and roast for 15-20 minutes.  Higher temperature will cause break down of fats, creating free radicals you don't want.  (Commercially roasted are generally heated to much higher temps)  Remember, too, that roasted seeds have a shorter shelf life than raw.  So there you have it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSpicy World Shredded Desiccated Unsweetened Coconut, 2 Pound\nReview:\nI ordered the wrong product.

I bought a small amount in a local store, and it was good, so then I researched prices, locally and on Amazon.com.  I have only used almond flour so far for baking gluten free cookies, but have some other recipes I want to try, which means that I will be using it in larger amounts.  Not only was the price better (plus  Amazon's Prime program two-day delivery), but I found that Anthony's Almond flour tasted richer (fresher?).

(Everyone had dill weed, which is not at all the same!) It's a good, high quality product, but the jar may be more than most people would use in a year or so.  If you use a lot of celery seed, it's still the best price around, and I would certainly recommend it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Soy Flour, 16 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nBob's Red Mill products are truly the \"best in class\" for flours.  They have both Gluten-containing flours (think: wheat, rye, et al) and gluten-free flours, (think: soy, rice, bean, etc) both are finest quality.  They also guarantee that there is no crossing of grinding equipment for both types, so you can be assured of the purity.  I don't really need gluten-free, but I bake things for a friend who has celiac disease.  The slightest hint of gluten in her food causes her severe problems.  She has had NO trouble with anything I have made for her.  She trusts me and I trust Bob's Red Mill.  'Nuff said.

I was able to make it according to the directions, and I didn't have to \"double-up\" the way some coffees need you to. I finely ground the beans in my grinder and used my french press.

Dark Chocolate was always one of my favorite treats before coming a Type 2 diabetic, so it is great being able to have it again in a sugar free version. There is a little bit of an after taste with these but dark chocolate is usually bitter so it isn't really an issue for me (but my wife says she notices more than I do).\n\nI should mention that eating too many of these (more than 3 or 4) does cause me some \"gastric distress\", so you might want to try them at home before eating a bunch while out in public.\n\nRecommended\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFiberPlus Antioxidant Bars, Chocolate Chip, 5-Count Bars 1.2 oz(Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThe Kellogg's Chocolate Chip \"FiberPlus Antioxidant Bars\" are surprisingly good tasting and are very filling. My wife bought me these to use as snack bars since I try to keep my total Carb intake as low as possible, and the high fiber content gives these each of these about 17 Net Carbs. They also have 120 Calories and about 2g of Protein.\n\nThe flavor is a lot better than most of other high fiber snack bars I have tried and these will become one of my regular treats.\n\nHighly Recommended!

My entire family [From my GrandMother on down to my own children] grew up on this and it is the best instant hot cereal on planet Earth!  I think this cereal is either being discontinued or going to another part of the country.  Either way I hope and pray that does not happen.  I live in the north Bronx area of NYC and I had to order this from Amazon.com because I couldn't find it in Pathmark, Target, Big K, Walmart, Sam's, Super Stop N Shop, Met's Food,Keyfood, The Finefare two blocks down from me, The Hispanic  stores [everywhere] don't carry it, BJ's and Costco do not have it either.  I was looking for this like a crackhead speedwalking with a couch on his/her back in the winter would after selling a $10 DVD player for a fix. I was like Maypo, Maypo, I gotta get my Maypo! I had a family relative go back down to the south Bronx and get two boxes from a store there that still carries it. Also I found one Stop N Shop in New Jersey that carries it. [That's why I chose Amazon!] Even though it is cheaper to get it from That store.  I will keep Amazon in mind if it should vanish completely.  Again, Amazon RULES!!! Oh and I do not work for Amazon.com or the makers of MAYPO either for all the haters out there.

(Pack of 3)\nReview:\nAs far as taste goes this is the best coconut oil I've tried. It has a slightly sweet flavor and melts very easily in coffee. I started using this daily by putting one tablespoon in my coffee. Imagine my surprise when I stepped on my scale and was five pounds lighter. I'd heard that coconut oil helped to increase the metabolism but I didn't realize eating one bottle of coconut oil would help me lose five pounds. It seems ironic that you could lose fat by eating fat but that really seems to be what happened. I also noticed my brain functioning better and I seem more alert and in a good mood. This coconut oil can be used for medium heat cooking as well. It is unrefined, organic and virgin. What more can you wish for? I'll be buying this again.\n\n~The Rebecca Review\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTazo Organic Baked Cinnamon Apple Herbal Infusion, Caffeine Free, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nAs someone who has formerly raved about Tazo's Teas I can say that my first experience with this tea was less than satisfactory. Using two teabags with 12 ounces of water produced a flavorless tea that didn't even have the hint of cinnamon let alone the fragrance of apples. Realizing that the weakness of the tea was the reason for my dissatisfaction I tried brewing the tea by using four teabags and 12 ounces of water. This produced a very acceptable tea with a full-bodied taste and the delicious fragrance of freshly picked apples. The ingredients in this tea include: African Rooibos, cinnamon, natural flavors, apple and chamomile. While this tea is not a five-star tea it is at least slightly comforting in the winter and if you brew it for longer than you would normally brew tea then you might find it to be delicious instead of disappointing.\n\n~The Rebecca Review\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nNature's Path Organic Chewy Granola Bars, Sunny Hemp Plus, 7.4 Ounce Box (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI hate making breakfast so these bars are perfect for winter mornings. Why save the flavor of pumpkin and spice for only the holiday season? These are delicious year round. They do however contain quite a bit of sugar so maybe they should be a treat and not a staple. Either way I'm happy when I eat one because these are a source of Omega-3. I can't see why anyone would say these are bland. They are bursting with flavor. My box says best before OCT 2012 so it is a fresh box. I could see how these would not taste good if they were stale.\n\n~The Rebecca Review\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNewman's Own Organics Organic Premium Chocolate Bar, Dark 54% Cocoa, 2.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nSo many dark chocolates are bitter or sour. Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate is as near perfect as a dark chocolate can be. It is creamy and dreamy and will give you the most seductive chocolate experience of your life. It really is that good. I also like that it is not overly sweet but just sweet enough to satisfy your craving. The vanilla flavor is also very subtle. Usually I'd say try a bar before you buy 12 but this time I'm saying buy 12 so you don't run out.\n\n~The Rebecca Review\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNumi Organic Tea Golden Chai, Full Leaf Black Tea, 18-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI'm used to drinking much stronger flavored chai teas so this one seemed like it wasn't spicy at all. You can barely taste the ginger. I think this tea would be much better if they added some peppercorns which is traditional. What this tastes like is a weak black tea with little flavor. I normally love Numi teas but this one seems too weak for me and I used two teabags per mug. So if you like stronger chai teas this may not suit you. It needs a lot more spices in my opinion.\n\n~The Rebecca Review\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nALMOND JOY, Chocolate Coconut Candy Bar (Pack of 36)\nReview:\nPart of my husband's job is to spoil his clients by bringing them cakes or candy or sometimes even lunch. I usually know what he is buying because he brings home the empty boxes (like Twinkie boxes) for recycling. I then of course have to look at the empty boxes wishing he would have saved me one treat. Well finally he did remember to bring me two Almond Joys. I must say they are one of my favorite chocolate candies. The crunch of the almond goes so well with the smooth chewy coconut all encased in a bliss of melting chocolate.

This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure.\n\nWhen holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the \"dark brown sugar\" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue.\n\nRecently I've been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy.\n\nThis is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar.\n\nSucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is \"green cut.\" This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium.\n\nIf you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking.\n\nIf you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can't be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level.\n\n~The Rebecca Review\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSwiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix, Sensible Sweets, Light, 8 count,0.29 ounce, (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nDear Santa,\n\nSince you read my reviews\nI thought I'd tell you the news\nI don't have a fireplace this year\nBut never you fear\nA fireplace DVD I'll be running\nAnd Christmas tunes I'll be humming\nKnock three times on the back door\nI'm sure that won't be too much of a chore\nDiet Hot Chocolate I'm making for you\nChocolate Oatmeal Cookies will also be new\nDon't forget presents for the cats\nThey will all be wearing little red hats\nSo Santa dear for you I'll be waiting\nAll those special presents I'll be anticipating\nI hope you don't mind that I wrote you this poem\nWell it seemed easier to reach you than by phone\n\nlove,\nme\n\nP.S.

This cultured ghee has been tolerable. The following is a suggested explanation on the product website:\n\n\"Why Cultured Ghee? Milk contains lactose, a natural sugar which gives it that delicate sweet taste. In order for the body to breakdown lactose into its basic components of simple sugars called glucose and galactose, an enzyme called lactase must be present. Many people lack this valuable enzyme in their digestive system causing a common digestive problem known as lactose intolerance. In order to metabolize lactose, lactase must always be present. During the natural bacterial fermentation process of milk or cream, lactose is converted into lactic acid. This makes for a much more digestible product for many people. Remember, generally ghee does not cause a problem with lactose intolerance. This is because during the ghee making process, the lactose is removed even if the butter used to make the ghee was not made from fermented cream.\"\n\nThe product website also states: \"Fermentation process produces flavor compounds such as diacetyl, giving this product a more buttery taste. Many people prefer the taste and aroma of freshly fermented foods.\"\n\nDiacetyl however is not entirely safe. In particular, its vapors are dangerous, as is noted on Wikipedia. Chronic exposure to its vapors is associated with lung disease and Alzheimer's. Technically, diacetyl can be removed, but there is no indication of PureIndianFoods doing this. Other similar compounds as a result of fermentation may also exist, but I can't be sure. As such, you probably do not want to heat this product much, or you may breathe in the diacetyl vapors. Eating the limited amount of diacetyl should probably be quite fine, however.\n\nMy LDL cholesterol rose substantially after eating this product for a few weeks. This is not unexpected considering the saturated fatty acid profile of the product. Although my HDL cholesterol also rose, I would rather not get in the LDL danger zone. Of course this is not enough evidence for any connection, but one may very well exist. If you decide to use it regularly, I recommend keeping track of all available lipid level indicators routinely.\n\nOn the positive side, vegetables do taste better with ghee. I didn't cook with the ghee, however, and only added it later.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nWholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia Packets, 1000 Count, 1 Case\nReview:\nThe inulin in it will make you regret it after your bacteria have used it as fuel as released generous amounts of waste gases.

I add it to burgers, braises, rub it on meats going on the grill, use it in soups and gravies and just generally use it anywhere that I am using beef. It ups the beefy flavor and makes your sauces and gravies sing with taste. For a long time I couldn't find it, I had originally picked up a few boxes of the cube form when I was on a road trip and haven't found it anywhere else since, when I finally used up the supply I had I was having withdrawals and tried every other product out there but they all fell short on the flavor that this has. I mentioned it on a group I belong to and one of the other members sent me the Amazon link to it in the canisters, I ordered it immediatly and couldn't wait until it arrived, it is exactly the same taste as the cube form and I am once again a happy cook, I even went back and ordered another six pack of the canisters and signed up for auto delivery of it for the future. What usually happens is when I find something we really like, it then stops being sold and I can't find it again for a long time. This time I will have a stockpile of a dozen canisters so I am set for quite a while. You also can't beat the Amazon price of the six canisters, consider that I paid almost two bucks for the pack of 8 cubes that I had originally bought and the price at Amazon is like getting it almost free compared to what I paid for 8 little cubes and each of these canisters is almost eight ounces of the product.

It was nice to buy a box now and then to remind me of Japan.  But now, they are showing up in Walmart and Costco.

If they had received whole cookies they would have been leaving great reviews like I am.  These are rich and delicious.  I have a family cookie recipe we call \"Almond Crescents\".  They look different, but they taste almost exactly like these wonderful cookiers even though we usually use finely chopped almonds when we make then.  These have chunks of pecans in them.  They really do melt in your mouth if you let them last that long.  Very buttery tasting.  They are crumbly, but if you are careful you will get every bite and not make a mess.\n\nFor once, I haven't looked at the calories.  It's the holidays.  I don't care.\n\nI bought my tin at Costco for a lot less than they are being sold for here.  You pay something for the convenience of mailing, but it's not worth it if they come as a can of crumbs.  I would probably still eat them and love them.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStarbucks Veranda Blend Light Blonde Roast Ground Coffee, 12-Ounce Bag\nReview:\nMy son likes taking a break from the stronger, bitter coffees with Starbucks Blonde blends.

No, you won't feel like you are eating something prepared in a good Thai restaurant, but it does taste far better than food in a bad Thai restaurant.  Not too hot and not too mild.  It's surprising because I don't usually like these Knorr rice side dishes very much.\n\nI think a lot of people must like this Thai curry flavor because I have a difficult time finding more than one or two packages at a time at any grocery store.

The difference is that the cream or butter is much thicker, has whole coconut in it, and a very strong coconut flavor. You would not use the coconut manna for cooking. It is used more as a spread (which you wouldn't usually do with coconut oil) or can even be eaten by itself or made into a candy (because it is slightly sweet). It can be added to smoothies or used in many other creative ways. Think of it like whole coconut meat in a creamy form.\n\nThe reason I did not give this coconut manna five stars is because it is packaged in a difficult way. First of all, the container is plastic. In order to use the coconut manna, the container must be heated gradually to a very warm room temperature (say 80 degrees, I'd think) or else put in hot water for 30 minutes, stirred, and left in hot water for 30 more minutes. This is very inconvenient, plus the plastic container is not good for all of the repeated heatings.\n\nOther than that, it's a great product. It is very slightly sweet and tastes strongly like coconut. The consistency is a bit gritty or grainy due to part of the coconut flesh that is powder and has been reconstituted, but I found that fine, not off-putting at all. It's great all by itself, added to smoothies, or put into the freezer in molds for a whole foods raw candy.\n\nRecommended.\n****\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nThe Good Bean Chickpea Snacks, Sea Salt, Gluten and Nut Free, 2.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\n*****\nThese are my very favorite snacks, and I like this flavor. My favorite flavor is the the smoky chili & lime followed by the sweet cinnamon. Still, these are good! They are crunchy too. If you like to munch on simple wholesome snacks, you'll like this one, I think.\n\nEach bag comes with two servings in it for a total of (if you eat both servings, which I do) 280 calories, 4g fat, 46g carbohydrates, and 14g protein. This snack is gluten-free and uses non-gmo garbanzo beans. The ingredients are roasted chickpeas, evaporated can juice (ie, sugar), coarse salt, gum arabic, expeller-pressed canola oil (non-gmo), and Vitamin E. Half of the package (or one serving) isn't that much food, plus then you have the problem of keeping the rest of the package crunchy--if you leave them out in a bowl they will be not so crunchy the next day. I'm not sure why they add the sugar, but the taste is really fantastic without being sweet, so maybe it keeps them from being bitter.\n\nSometimes if I just want to have a delicious snack and I'm hungry and able to handle the carbs, I have these. They take a while to eat (they can be a bit hard on your teeth as they are very, very crunchy) and fill you up, plus if you drink lots of water (or other beverage) with it, you'll be really full afterwards.\n\nThey can be purchased alone in a six-pack here or as part of the sampler set. I have noticed mixed reviews here, so they are not to everyone's tastes; if you're not sure you'll like them, you can always order them as part of the sampler.\n\nHighly recommended.\n*****\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBare Natural Apple Chips, Cinnamon, Gluten Free + Baked, Single Serve Bag - 1.7 Oz (10 Count)\nReview:\n*****\nThese apple chips are tart, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.\n\nThese particular chips are only just barely sweet, mostly tart. If you want sweet apple chips, you can buy Fuji apple chips from the same company that are just as crisp and good. I like to mix both together for a sweet-tart combo.\n\nI would recommend (and it's way more economical) to buy these in bulk. If you like tart apples at all, and you like your chips crispy, then you have nothing to lose.\n\nNote: Each of the many dried fruits that are prepared and processed by Bare Fruits--each one is different--some are chewy, some crispy, but all are natural and vary as the natural fruits vary. In my opinion, their brand would tend to appeal to people who like things without added sugars and preservatives and whose taste buds and teeth can handle less processed food. The apple chips are very easy on the teeth, though...just so you know, not every product is like that\n\nHighly recommended.\n*****\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Green Tea Super Antioxidant - Helps Reduce Free Radicals - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\n*****\nWhat a wonderful tea this is! Herb-y tasting in a good way, and slightly sweet (from the licorice root) with lemongrass overtones and jasmine reminisces. This Green Tea Super Anti-Oxidant from Yogi Tea is one of my favorite teas. It has everything to make it a perfect everyday green tea. It is made from Organic Lemongrass, Organic Green Tea Leaf, Organic Licorice Root, Jasmine Green Tea Leaf, Organic Alfalfa Leaf, Organic Burdock Root, Organic Dandelion Root, Grapeseed Extract, Irish Moss Powder, and Emblic Fruit (Amla) Extract.\n\nGreen Tea Super Anti-Oxidant comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.\n\nAccording to Yogi Tea, this tea is 80% organic and is intended combat the damage of free radicals in the body that accelerate aging. It contains 21mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee).\n\nYogi Green Tea Super Anti-Oxidant makes me glad every day that I stopped drinking coffee and switched to teas---it's that good! If you've only tried commercial brands like Stash and Celestial Seasoning, and you think you don't like tea because they taste fake and full of strong flavorings, then you owe it to yourself to give this tea a try. If you enjoy Stash and Celestial Seasonings, love their strong flavors, and disagree with me, you may not like this tea as it is subtle and a very different tea-drinking experience. You'll know what type of tea drinker you are!\n\nHighly recommended.\n*****\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Green Tea Super Antioxidant - Helps Reduce Free Radicals - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\n*****\n\nThis Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.\n\nI am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.\n\nYogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: \"Green Tea Decaf Kombucha uses the same delicious recipe as our Green Tea Kombucha but is naturally decaffeinated. Our organically certified CO2 decaffeination method removes only the caffeine while leaving all of the beneficial polyphenolic elements of Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) intact. This method also maintains the antioxidant properties and delicate flavor of our delicious, organically-grown Green Tea.* Unlike other green teas, this special organic Green Tea has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. This formula incorporates the natural antioxidant properties of Green Tea with a concentrated, purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm). This extract is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs and is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea. For centuries, practitioners of herbal medicine have used Kombucha to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach.* This convenient form of Kombucha can be taken daily for maximum health benefits.\"\n\nYogi Tea's use of \"Kombucha-Pure\", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.\n\nNote that Yogi Tea also makes a caffeinated version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea does include caffeine.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n*****\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Green Tea Super Antioxidant - Helps Reduce Free Radicals - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\n****\nThis Green Tea Energy from Yogi Tea is a \"natural energy boost\".  It's an unusual, rather herb-y tasting natural herbal tea made from organic green tea leaf, Asian (Panax) ginseng, organic lemongrass, organic spearmint leaf, ginseng-eleuthero extract (Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolium, Eleutherococcus senticosus), and kombucha . The taste is very difficult for me, and the kombucha comes across extra strong. I predict that you'll either love or hate the taste of this tea; try it first before you buy it in large quantities.\n\nI am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Green Tea Energy comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices.

It contains 28mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee).\n\nI gave this tea only four stars because the taste is so hard for me to handle. It is, however, a quality tea, and if you like it, there are many benefits to be gained.\n\nRecommended, if you can stand the taste.\n****\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nThe Good Bean Crunchy Chickpea, Smoky Chili/Lime, Gluten and Nut Free, 2.5 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\n*****\nThese are my very favorite snacks, and this flavor--the smoky chili & lime--is the one I like best.

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.\n\nThe ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.\n\nThe manufacturer writes: \"Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.\nCertain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.\"\n\nI must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.\n****\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCORAZONAS Heart Healthy Original Whole Wheat &amp; Fiber Snack, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)\nReview:\n*****\nThis is a healthy and delicious chip, approved by both my junk food loving husband and me (I eat healthfully). Corazonas are a high fiber (3g) and low salt chip perfect for heart patients---with only 115mg of salt. You can actually see the oats in them, and I enjoy that they fill you up better than conventional commercial chips.\n\nAlthough each serving of chips has 7g of fat, note that they are made without trans fats and with healthy fats instead. If you are on a diet that minimizes all fats, you'd of course want to avoid them, but if you believe that certain fats (in this case expeller pressed high oleic safflower, mid-oleic sunflower, and/or canola oil) are fine in moderation and enjoy the full fat taste, these are the chips for you.\n\nThe 7oz large bags are larger, but they taste so good that they are addictive, and I like prefer these chips pre-measured into smaller quantities; thus I like the 2oz bags. So, if you're like me, buy this item, otherwise search for the larger bags. I like the plain Corazonas even more than the Jalapeno Jack version, which we have also tried, because they are wholesome and taste good on their own.\n\nCorazonas claim to be the only chips containing plant sterols, which they say is proven to reduce cholesterol.\n\nHighly recommended.\n*****\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['tea', 'organic', 'teas', 'like', 'numi', 'green', 'taste', 'natural', 'flavor', 'ingredients']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S Kitchens Baking Bar, Unsweetened Chocolate, 4 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI eat a square most evenings as a tasty sugar-free snack.

I usually have a hard time stretching but after a week of drinking this tea, I felt almost like an athlete as far as my joints were concerned.  The yucca root extract, cat's claw bark extract (uncaria tomentosa alkaloids), and devil's claw root extract in it certainly help with relieving any joint pain.  Also, I notice that I have fewer allergy sneeze/running nose attacks that I usually have and fewer colds.\n\nIt's an excellent tea if you want to relieve your joints and a great value for your money especially with Subscribe & Save.\n\nNote: if you have any loose herbs, muslin bags such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cotton-Muslin-Bags-4x6-Inches-25-Count-Pack/dp/B009OFKLE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cotton Muslin Bags 4x6 Inches 25 Count Pack</a>&nbsp;are great to pack them in without having to deal with trying to remove loose herbs in your teas and/or if you want to try different mixes of herbal bagged teas to get different medicinal effects or want to try different new herbs.  The bags help to easily remove the herbs, even if bagged and you don't accidentally drink any of the herbs which can be pretty yucky tasting.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nThe Republic of Tea Double Green Matcha, Gourmet Blend of Organic Green Tea And Matcha Powder (50 Tea Bags)\nReview:\nI love Republic of Tea's rooibos teas. I bought mine at Whole Foods.  Republic of Tea's teas quality rival Numi's but I think this rooibos tea is even higher in quality than Numi's since you get \"double\" the dose of usual rooibos so that you get a deeper taste of rooibos and you can see and smell the red rooibos powder lightly dusted off the teabags.  And the packaging is compact and attractive, great as a gift.  What I like about rooibos is that it doesn't have that yucky tasting flowery herbal taste of hibiscus, rosehips, etc that teas like Celestial Seasoning are notoriously known for.  Also, you don't have to feel like Superman trying to break into their teabags (like Numi's) since there are no enclosed individual protective packets around each tea bag.  Rooibos teas are nutty and mellow in taste.\n\nRooibos is healthy, great for skin ailments and calming for anxiety/nervous tension (which is why I love it so much), and it has no caffeine.  I double my health with it by adding raw unprocessed honey but it's really already slightly sweetened so that you don't need a lot of sweetener.  The tea is even better iced.  If it weren't so expensive, I'd get it more often but am forced with the lower cost alternative with Twining's rooibos teas which has a more \"hay\" taste/smell.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNumi Organic Tea Rooibos Chai, 18 Bags, Caffeine Free Herbal Teasan, Organic Rooibos Tea Blended with Chai Spices (Packaging May Vary), Premium Organic Non-Caffeinated Rooibos Chai Tisane, Red Tea\nReview:\nI was 1st introduced to Numi teas when I was drawn to the artistic, beautiful packaging of Numi's rooibos tea (the version with the artistic drawing of elephants in an african savannah) at Safeway supermarket as I needed a small food item but that had an expensive-look to serve as a \"community\" gift for everyday munching or drinking for coworkers at work for our small kitchen/computer/lunchroom at a prestigious company. After finding their rooibos tea so wonderfully tasting as well as relaxing to my nerves as I get anxious and nervous, rooibos tea has been my #1 breakfast tea to drink in the morning.\n\nTheir rooibos is much milder than you find with the more affordable Twinings tea but rooibos tastes a little nutty and you don't need sugar since it has a very mildly sweet taste. I, however, will also add organic raw honey to it to give me the benefits not only of the herb but also the benefits of the organic unprocessed honey which makes it a complete healthful breakfast tea for me.\n\nThere's a VERY TINY cut in the corner to indicate where to rip the teabag package but what I don't like about Numi teas is sometimes, the cut is not there and so that same small paper-plastic packaging that holds each tea bag is difficult to open OR when you rip it at the cut end, the rip still doesn't result in the opening of the tea bag pkg - it's protective with tough plastic on the inside and you NEED scissors or else you won't be able to open it unless you're Superman.\n\nBut what i love about their teas is that, like another reviewer posted, they don't taste like the usual flowery herbs (like licorice, flowery herbs/roots/leaves, mint, hibiscus, rosehips, etc.) which is what i hate about Celestial Seasonings Tea and why i moved away from Twinings blackcurrant tea when they changed the formula. So you get the benefit of the herb in the tea without the yucky flowery herbal tastes/flavors.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Surf Sweets Gummy Bears, Nut Free, Gluten Free, Dairy Free, 2.75 oz. (Pack of 12) \nReview:\nAs another reviewer posted and the package states:\n\n\"Organic fruit juice, Fortiied with Vitamin C, natural colors and flavors, free of Corn Syrup and GMO's, nut-free, and gluten-free\"\n\nIf you like Black Forest non-organic gummy bears (and I'm one of them), these would have to be almost indistinguishable from them - soft and slightly chewy but NOT incredibly chewy like haribo (which I hate) or yummyearth, but unlike yummyearth organic gummy bears whose sweetness you can taste just from the outside of the gummybear, surfsweet's tasty sweetness is buried in the gummy bear like Black Forest.\n\nIt's 90% organic and \"Certified Organic by Quality Assurance International.\"  Ingredients, as exactly stated on the back of the package, are: \"Organic Tapioca Syrup, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Gelatin, Organic Grape Juice Concentrate, Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Colors Added (including Black Carrot Juice Concentrate, Turmeric, Annatto), Natural Flavors, Organic Sunflower Oil, Carnauba Wax.\"\n\nOf course, the packets of gummy bears are tiny with only ABOUT 10 gummy bears which total only 80 calories.  You don't get many gummy bears per small packet.  But then, they're ORGANIC, corn syrup-free, GMO-free, nut-free and gluten-free.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNatural Nectar Natural ChocoDream, Belgian Cocoa Spread with Hazelnuts, 12.3-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nYeah, the pkg says the Cocoa is Fair Trade Certified and it's made in Belgium and it has no trans fat and nothing artificial but it's first ingredient on its list is sugar and it has palm and/or canola oil.

If you've tasted Reese's, then you won't be disappointed.  Usually when I buy organic, the taste isn't really that great, but Justin's was even better than Newman's (which is like almost liquidy dripping -not that tasty- peanut butter coming out of a melting chocolate shell.)  Justin's is a firmer tasty peanut butter filling in a firm tasty chocolate shell.  It's organic, vegan so a better alternative to Reese's but still tasty.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['tea', 'like', 'taste', 'rooibos', 'nbsp', 'organic', 'great', 'teas', 'add', 'honey']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nAnnie's Gluten Free  Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar Macaroni &amp; Cheese, 12 Boxes, 6oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nversus making your own gluten free mac and cheese (or any mac and cheese for that matter).

These are packaged in individual serving bags for portion control and easy portability.  The almonds are coated in chocolate and then they have a dusting of red powder on them that taste like raspberry. They are a little messy to eat if you touch them with your fingers because the red powder goes everywhere. There is a lot of extra red powder in each pouch.

The flavor is dense chocolate but there is a bit of a chalk taste.\n\nThe bars are tiny, at one ounce per bar. From the photo on the box you would assume that the two pieces shown were one bar that was broken in half hence the broken off end part that is shown -- but actually what you see there are two separate bars with some crumbs removed from one end which is really, really misleading. Look at the other reviews for photos of the actual size of the bar compared to the packaging.\n\nThe one ounce bar has 120 calories and 35 grams of fat.\n\nThey are gluten free, dairy free, nut free, and soy free. They are non-GMO. They contain xanthum gum and gum arabic in case you need that information.\n\nI rate these 2 stars = I Don't Like It due to both the taste being not that great and the small size being not of good value.

I liked the taste of these salted cashews, they were a just-right saltiness level for me. I am allergic to soy though, and I don't need extra oils added into the cashews. I stared to wonder if I was wrong in my thinking so I did some research online and found that indeed some cashews use a salt water brine with no oil, and homemade recipes call for olive oil with salt. I am rating 3 stars = It's Okay as I don't like the oil choices in this product due to highly allergenic soy, the peanut allergy issue for those assuming cashews would not contain peanuts. We usually buy raw cashews or organic salted cashews.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSoFit Fruit and Protein Squeeze, Mango Orange, 4.2 Ounce (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nThis is our family's  first use of a snack of this type. You unscrew the cap and consumed this fruit pure, it is not a liquid juice but has more of a consistency of baby food. This is made from pear juice , fruit pure of blueberry raspberry, strawberry, and apple. It contains way dairy for the protein and honey for sweetness. It contains 20 g of carbs, of which 17 g are sugars. There are 6 g of protein. It is 100 cal.  It is gluten-free and is non- GMO.\n\n It can be served at room temperature or chilled and it is shelf stable to be stored at room temperature. I felt the flavor was a strong fruit taste such as you may have tasted in a protein smoothie powder product or  fruit flavors of a workout  electrolyte  replacement drink.  It does not taste like fresh real fruit to me. I personally wouldn't choose to eat this but my teenage son who is an athlete who is on a high-protein diet  of six meals a day liked the flavor and enjoyed this type of new to us snack food.  This son of mine refuses to eat dried fruit as a snack so perhaps this type of food product is a way to get some fruits into someone as in on the go snack food.  It's hard to rate food products when one person like loves it in another doesn't I will say 4 stars = I like it.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Certified Organic, non-GMO, Vegan Hazelnut Spread with Cocoa, Chia and Flaxseed, Classic Chocolate, 13-ounce\nReview:\nThis is a healthier alternative to Nutella and the consistency (spreadability) is better than Jason's as is the taste. Nutella was the first chocolate hazelnut spread I ever tried back when it was the only one on the market in USA. It was super sweet and made with corn syrup. I stopped eating it due to the unhealthiness of it and because to me it started to taste more like canned frosting. Jason's was the next I tried. Jason's is less sweet but needs a lot of stirring which is a challenge and it separates easily and can have some grit to it, it's not super smooth. Now I have tried Nutiva and it is amazing. The consistency is just like creamy peanut butter, no grit, smooth and spreadable. It has a deep chocolate taste and a good hazlenut flavor and it is not sickening sweet. This has 40% less sugar than Nutella.\n\nNutiva's ingredients that are notable are first, it's organic. Second, it contains sustainable non-problematic (no gorilla controversy) palm oil and coconut oil which help it have a smooth consistency. Mine arrived with no pooling or separation of oils. It also has chia oil which boosts the omega 3 count which Nutiva uses to promote this as a healthy food but let's not get carried away. This is what it is: a dessert like chocolate hazelnut treat, I am not looking to justify eating this treat by saying it's a health food. Nutiva is now my favorite chocolate hazelnut spread, it's a treat not a daily food for me. Highly recommended, 5 stars = I Love It.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Schr Gluten Free Chocolate Hazelnut Bars, 3-Count (6-Pack) \nReview:\nCrisp thin wafers with hazelnut in between plus dipped in chocolate.

They are a special treat.

I had no idea what they would taste like: the taste is coconut.\n\nThis is a raw food product, dehydrated at under 105 degrees, this is considered a live food. The ingredients are coconut, sprouted sesame seeds, and dates (all organic).\n\nHas no: GMOs, trans fats, or cholesterol.\n\nThese have a good flavor and a sweet taste, they don't taste un-sweet despite having no sugar or added fruit juices.\n\nOddly I find all the super cookie products by Go Raw to be filling and I actually often eat about 8 which is less than half a serving. The serving size is 18. They help satisfy my taste for something cookie like and something sweet, I am trying to eat grain free and to reduce sugar intake as I am pre-diabetic.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Schr Gluten Free Penne, 12 oz. Box, 5-Pack \nReview:\nTook a chance on this as the quest for as close to normal pasta as possible while being gluten-free is a constant quest. This does not disappoint! It tastes completely normal and like white flour wheat flour. It has a dark color but it tastes like a white flour plain taste. Other GF pastas have a taste of nuttiness or something bitter but this is great.\n\nOne discrepancy, I bought this a couple of weeks ago and my package says cook 5-6 minutes only (the product description here today says double that time). After 6 minutes it was perfectly cooked, al dente just a bit and it also did not clump up in the pot, or while draining, or on the plate. It did not fall apart at all.\n\nIngredients are: buckwheat, sorghum flour, and chickory root flour listed at the back and the full disclosure also says: rice flour, corn flour, lentil flour, cane sugar syrup (last ingredient on the list). Made in Italy, Labeled gluten-free, wheat-free, lactose-free. If you have questions it says to call customer service at 201-355-8470 or email at info at schar dot com.\n\nI rate this 5 stars = I Love It.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Organic, non-GMO, Premium Ground Chia Seeds\nReview:\nToday I used 3 tablespoons to make Chia pudding which means that I added it to coconut milk and then refrigerated it until it gelled. There was a loud crunch and there was a gray and black rock in it, which I threw away thinking it was a fluke. Then I found the second rock which you can see in the photo ( the first rock was twice the size).\n\n I chose to use this brand because it is non-GMO, certified organic, and certified gluten-free. I thought that meant this would be a quality product.  I called Nutiva today, and reached an American worker who just responded that I should return it to the store for a refund.  She asked where I got it from and I told her Amazon.com. I told her that I was upset that there were two rocks,  and then I think someone there would like to know that there's rocks mixed in with the Chia seed. Then she said, \"Oh if you want you can send us an email with a photo with the lot number so that we can check it out.\" She was very nonchalant. I was shocked.\n\nNutiva is a brand I will be avoiding.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nOatmeal Packets by thinkThin, Instant Protein &amp; Fiber Hot Oatmeal for On The Go- 10g Protein, 5g Fiber, Vegan - Madagascar Vanilla with Almonds and Pecans, 1.76 oz Packets (6 Boxes/6 Packets Per Box)\nReview:\nThis is a 10 grams of protein instant oatmeal. You can use boiled water or it is microwaveable. The dry contents look like a regular oatmeal but when it plumps up you can see it is more, better. It has whole oats, steel cut oats and quinoa as the fiber. It also has dried fruits that plump up. It has cane sugar to add sweetness but it's not overly sweet. The protein is soy. There are 190 calories. This is a better alternative than the overly processed oatmeal packets that have been sold for decades at the grocery store. This is for people who need more protein or want more protein to help with a weight loss program or for athletes trying to get more protein all day long.

It imparts beautiful color and gives food a delightful, smoky, barbeque taste. We've had great luck using this to add a smoked bacon flavor to meatless dishes, but it's also great for making chicken and beef taste bacon wrapped. This one is spicy hot, but not hot like cayenne or crushed pepper, so If you enjoy spicy foods you will probably find this one delicious.

I'm glad I did. As a hot breakfast cereal, it has a nutty flavor and a consistency similar to MaltoMeal, but is much better for you! The taste took a little getting used to (it's best with some milk and brown sugar) but I now like it quite a bit. I've added it to my breakfast mix, and alternate it with oatmeal. I've also started mixing in a tablespoon or two of flax seed from time to time. It also goes really well with fresh berries, or even frozen blueberries if you thaw them out first.\n\nWhile not quite supplanting oatmeal as my hot cereal of choice, Kamut has proven to be well worth the purchase; tasty, healthy, and organic. What more can you ask for from a product purchased on a whim?\n\n*****UPDATE 07/15/2010*****\n\nI tried making the \"Pharaohs Muffins\" recipe on the back of the package and loved it! I added chopped dates, raisins, and ginger, as well as a pinch of cinnamon. I also omitted the butter and sugar, and instead used apple sauce. The muffins turned out extremely well, and I'll be making them again. My wife also loved them, as did the coworkers I shared them with. They were pretty surprised to find out they clock in at 145 calories and have virtually no fat! So give them a try--they are worth it.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nGatorade Performance Series Nutrition Shake, Vanilla, 11-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese Gatorade nutrition shakes are easily the best tasting energy/nutrition/protein shakes I've ever tasted. The consistency is nice and smooth with zero chalkiness, which most energy shakes are ruined by. This one is just perfect as far as flavor and consistency.\n\nTo other reviewers saying the shakes have too many calories and not enough protein: these are not intended specifically as protein shakes. That's why they're called \"Nutrition\" shakes. If you want a specific protein shake, there are many of them available. I look at these as a light meal replacement or as an after work out energy replacement.\n\nAn interesting note: The cans are made of steel not aluminum; they are much heavier and stronger than aluminum cans which means they can be stored in a gym back and not accidentally get burst open.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGolden Valley Natural Buffalo Jerky, Original, 3-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nI've always thought buffalo jerky is much better tasting that beef jerky, as well as being leaner, and hence better for you. This buffalo jerky doesn't disappoint in the flavor department. It is slightly sweet, and has a very nice texture. However, some of the portions were a little dry and hard for my taste. There are also the occasional pieces of fat that I found in one bag. That is the disadvantage of buying 8 bags at a time online; you can't visually inspect what you're getting and not select bags that contain too much fat. You can contact Golden Valley and they will replace any bag that has too much fat for your taste, but expect 2-3 weeks before they'll deliver the replacement bag. Still, better customer service than most companies!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nRishi Tea Organic Black Tea, Earl Grey Loose Tea, 3.3-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI've always enjoyed a good cup of Earl Grey (especially when coupled with a good book) but have not really gotten loose leaf before. This Rishi Earl Grey is very nice, not overly heavy with no licorice undertones that I really find unappealing in some Earl Gery varieties. The tea takes four minutes to steep, and when done is quite aromatic. I would recommend this one without reservation.\n\n*****Update 10-10-2009*****\n\nI had to come update this review to express how much I LOVE this tea. It's easily one of the most enjoyable teas I've experienced (I'm drinking a cup of it as I update this review) and it always makes me happy when I brew a cup. This is a lovely tea!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTraditional Medicinals Organic Chamomile Herbal Leaf Tea, 16 Tea Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nTraditional Medicinals makes some really nice tea, and their organic peppermint is one of the best. It is strong; none of that weak fare you get at your local grocery store. You can really taste the peppermint oil on your tongue, almost as if it were brewed from fresh peppermint. It is not sweet; add some honey or raw sugar if you like it that way. Excellent for your digestive track and memory, peppermint tea is a wonderful study aid and will help you stay focused without getting the jitters of caffeine.\n\nA first class tea, and easy to recommend to anyone who enjoys herbals.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFruit Harvest Cereal, Strawberry Blueberry, 12.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is one of my favorite breakfast cereals. I think what distinguishes it most is the quality of the freeze-dried fruit. When combined with milk, the fruit rehydrates quite well, tasting neither soggy nor chewy like so many others.\n\nIt might not be the healthiest cereal available, but it is low in sugar, tastes great, and beats eating Grape Nuts or granola every morning. If you want a real treat, mix in some fresh blueberries...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nReeses Puffs, Peanut Butter, 22.9 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI'm at risk of obesity and cardiac failure because of this breakfast cereal. Not far down the ingredient list you can find \"crack cocaine,\" which gives these puffs their signature taste and addictive quality. I eat these for breakfast. I eat them as a snack. I eat them for desert. I hoard them from the other members of my family. These are high-risk behaviors that have started to concern those who love me. But they are all wrong. I don't have a problem. I have tasty Reese's Puffs. This \"Family Size\" is really an \"Individual Size.\" Because I am not sharing, not with you, not with anyone. I will shovel these tasty chocolate and peanut butter puffs down my gullet until I die a very happy man, likely not far in the distant future. So take your opinions and condemnation elsewhere, breakfast confection hater. Enjoy your flavorless wheat sticks and low fat yogurt in the dark comfort of your empty, soulless existence. I will chow down on my Reese's Puffs until I collapse face-first into my cereal bowl.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKa-Me Noodle Box, Pad Thai, 11.6 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nKa-Me makes a lot of different rice/noodle dishes, some of which are really quite good for prepared meals. This variety, however, is not their best. The noodles are ok, but the Szechuan flavoring is not to my taste. It's a bit generic and a little too salty. I much prefer their Red Curry rice meals which are very, very good.\n\nStill worth getting to mix into the lunch rotation, but will never be a favorite of mine.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nGhirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Chocolate Mocha, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nGhiradelli might not make the best chocolate in the world, but their chocolate mix is my personal favorite. It is rich and mixes easily without the residue in the bottom of the cup that lesser brands suffer from. The mocha flavor is very good with a strong coffee flavor that doesn't overpower the chocolate. This is simply great hot chocolate and well worth getting if you enjoy mocha. It also mixes very well in milk shakes!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nV8 Vegetable Juice, Low Sodium, 46-Fl Oz Bottles (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nNutritionists recommend that you get a serving of vegetables with every meal, but how to accomplish that with a breakfast has always been a tough one for me since I don't like starchy vegetables like potatoes, and aside from cutting up a tomato, few other things go well with yogurt, egg whites, oatmeal, or any of the other stuff I like in the morning. A simple glass of V8 works perfectly. I've always loved V8 juice for that reason, but found it just a tad too salty. The low sodium version has made V8 perfect in my opinion. It has more flavor than most tomato juices, with a nice hint of celery seed. (It also makes a mean Bloody Mary!). Amazon's price for a 12 pack shipped free is very competitive, especially if you sign up for a subscription. Whether you get it from Amazon or somewhere else, it's just as good. Get yourself some.

We normally buy the standard Gatorade mix from the grocery store, but were intrigued with the new carb-recovery drink.  So, he put it to the test.  For flavor, he states that this drink tastes pretty similar to the original orange, which is refreshing.  Those who like standard Gatorade may find this a little on the overly-sweet side, as it is higher in carbs and sweetness than the \"original\" drink.  For flavor alone, that was our only caution and the reason for withholding 1 star.  However, after one particularly difficult workout (a long, sweat-soaked round of shoveling after a PA snow storm) he thought that the flavor and sweetness were fine.\nHis personal recommendation was that this drink did a better job than the standard Gatorade of getting him back on his feet hydration-wise.  We have often found that after a grueling workout he battles dehydration for the rest of the day, which also leads to exhaustion.  In my years as a personal trainer, I have learned that the body maintains hydration best when it is accompied by a moderate dose of carbs because it helps the water stay in the body longer, thus making it more available to recovering muscles.  Generally speaking, he felt that his total recovery from the workout was significantly faster and better than with the standard sports drink, and the flavor is good if you're not taking anything else sweet at the same time.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

With hazelnut, the crunch and flavor has a pleasant exotic texture.\n\nThe hazelnut flavor is not subtle. For me, this is a good thing, and, as a result, I can devour two bars faster than I should.\n\nDistribution is still weak in the United States, but can be found increasingly in larger cities. Usually, then, it is found only in international grocery stores, though it pops up in eclectic grocers from time to time. It has been around 100 years. Whether or not Kraft will change the recipe has yet to be seen. For now, the texture and taste are better than Hershey's and Nestle. It is a smoother, creamier basic chocolate, although they also make varieties which include yogurt, nuts and a version with Oreo Cookies.

However, after a visit with my daughter during which we made a variety of home-made pizzas, she demonstrated what an excellent pizza sauce it makes. She spreads it on the dough, with no other sauce, and tops it with prosciutto; then when it comes out of the oven sprinkle chopped arugula over the top - delicious and easy home made pizza.\n\nThere are many other uses for the Kirkland Chopped Garlic - toss it in a stew or soup, saut it with fresh spinach, put a dab in an omelette, add it to fresh home-made tomato sauce/pizza sauce. It works well in any cooked dishes; however for un-cooked dishes which require fresh garlic, I still do it the old fashioned way. The Kirkland Chopped Garlic is not as pungent and tasty as fresh garlic and doesn't have that unique, sharp aroma and bite.\n\nDon't be put off by the large 48 oz. plastic jar. While it seems like a huge quantity, at least a third of the volume is water, and if you do a lot of home cooking, you will consume it before the \"use by\" date. Best of all, you will never be without garlic when you need it.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

The MM has been great, and the taste of the RE is very good (although we like the MM best). Our problem with it is, we must have gotten a bad batch. We've had four of the K cups so far expel just about the entire contents of the K cup in grounds, and we're not halfway through the batch.\n\nWe re-read the Keurig instructions to be sure we weren't doing something wrong, and we're not. This is apparently a defective batch. Now, I know based on previous Amazon experiences that Amazon would replace this in a heartbeat, no questions asked; but we've already drunk half the coffee and I just don't think it's fair to expect a full replacement when only a small percentage of the product is unacceptable. But at the per-cup price, even one defective K cup is a real drag--not to mention the trauma of downing those mud-thick grounds first thing in the morning when you're not anywhere near being awake yet!\n\nHopefully, Timothy's will do a little QA and find out what's going on with their production process that would allow this kind of thing to happen. Because we really do love their coffee.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Of course I try to duplicate that restaurant Oriental taste as much as possible. I watch many cooking shows on TV and on SEVERAL of the shows, chefs used Five Spice Powder Seasoning. Thus one has so many positive reviews, I decided to try it for myself.\n\nThe results for me is just amazing and I found my Oriental dishes have much better flavor as I am now using thus spice regularly. In addition to using it for Oriental dushes, I tried this in my spaghetti and even in my a Taco meat. Wow, these dishes had more flavor and much zestier!\n\nHowever, what you need to know us that this Seasoning is very, very strong. When I cook with it, I just use a very tiny pinch of it. That way it is not overpowering in her dish.\n\nThe taste of is is sweet, sour, hot, yet comforting. In my opinion, it brings to my dushes the question What is that special flavor in this food? Since I add just a tiny amount of this seasoning, the food is a delight I have really received compliments.\n\nOne more thing: Thus spice is in a glass jar and closes up well to lock in the marvelous flavor.\n\nHighly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNu-Salt Substitute Shaker, 3 Ounce\nReview:\nPersonally, I love the taste of salt, and love to eat salty foods. Hence, I found myself eating too much salt and my fingers began to swell, especially the first thing in the morning. So I realized that I was eating and retaining too much salt! Then a couple of weeks ago, I was in my local market and noticed the Nu-Salt Salt Substitute and decided to give it a try. The taste I find is very pleasant and very similar to that of salt. Moreover, I noticed is now that I can sprinkle lots of this on my food and this satisfies my need for that salty taste, and my fingers no longer swell. And best of all, I lost 4 pounds due to water weight that came off!\n\n**May I suggest that you DO NOT use this while you are cooking foods, instead, wait until the food is cooked and at the table then add this Salt Substitute. It goes much further and last longer this way.\n\nThis is a superb product and if you love the taste of salt like I do and you are on a restricted salt intake diet, this is the product to buy!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFiber One Chewy Bar, Oats and Peanut Butter, 1.4 Ounce, 5 Count, Pack of 12\nReview:\nFor many years before I tried this Fiber One Oats & Peanut Butter Chewy Bar, I was Peanut Butter Candy Bar junkie! For that matter, anything with peanut butter in it was just want I wanted. However, I realized that I need more fiber. So decided to give these chewy bars a try and this is what I found:\n\n1) They are sweet enough to make my sweet tooth happy.\n2) They have plenty of peanuts and peanut flavor to suit me.\n3) Love the chewy texture, it is more like eating a regular candy bar, but I do not feel the guilt.\n4) These are a necessity for me as I keep one in my purse at all times to keep with me as I have low blood sugar and have to eat often. This keeps something in my stomach until I can eat a regular meal.\n5) Fiber: At 4.5 grams, this is a nice serving. And it works well for me as I eat other foods with fiber during the day.\n\nGreat product!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHormel Compleats Swedish Meatballs, 9 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis is the best of the Hormel Compleats line of foods! Great tasting also! For me, a few weeks ago I picked up nearly every variety of the Hormel Compleats at my local store just to see which ones I prefer. This one the Beef Pot Roast is wonderful and my favorite of this line. For me, I add some garlic powder, a little black pepper and maybe seasoned salt to enhance it. Then I eat this with 2 slices of bread for a really nice lunch. Keep in mind this is FAST FOOD/Convenience food yet it still tastes good for that type of food. Does it taste like homemade? No, but more so than other brands I tried. For a quick lunch at work or at home and one that will save you time and money, consider this.\n\nRecommended!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNissin Chicken Cup Noodles, 2.4 Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nWonderful lunch and it fills me up - so tasty! This soup I picked up at my local market to try out as they were on sale for just 50 cents for one soup. Bought 5 of them and brought them home to try out! So this soup I highly recommend this soup for these reasons:\n\n1) Noodles fit easily into a tablespoon or soup spoon!\n\n2) Plenty of noodles in this soup.\n\n3) Rich chicken flavor (no chicken pieces or veggies in this but still a wonderful flavor).\n\n4) Filling! So for me, I added a few crushed crackers into this for added filling ability.\n\n5) Makes a wonderful lunch and it takes just 3 minutes in a microwave to heat this up!\n\nHighly recommend this!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nQuaker Oats Quick Oatmeal, 18-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis oatmeal reminds me of the kind my mother and grandmother made for me when I was a child. This Quaker Oats Quick Oatmeal tastes so much better then the Instant kind! It still has that same taste and texture that I remember. What I do to make it even creamier is to add extra milk in place of the water. After it is cooked, I add just a little more milk and if they are available some fresh strawberries. For me this makes a wonderful and healthy breakfast all year round.\n\nHighly recommend this!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPillsbury Angel Food Cake Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis Pillsbury Angel Food Cake is such a light and fluffy cake!

There were no cupcakes left as everyone ate at least one cupcake and some had two! While I bring refreshments each time I visit (like cupcakes or brownies), they all told me that this was the best cupcakes they ever tasted. I agree as I ate one myself and it was so hard to eat just one!\nOh and one more thing: To keep it simple, instead of a frosting, I sprinkled a light coat of powdered sugar atop each cupcake and baked each cupcake in a paper liner.\n\nVery highly recommend the Pillsbury Angel Food Cake Mix!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nROTEL Original Diced Tomatoes and Green Chilies, 10 Ounce\nReview:\nSince I live this Rotel Original, I had to share with others how wonderful it is!

I do make it very strong using the 8 cup setting while grinding it for about 3 cups in my big mug. I typically add a dash of liquid Coffee Mate, and with this I wanted 3 dashes.\n\nIt's not bad coffee, it just had a different taste that I didn't care for. In 35 years I've tried a lot of coffees and I can like Folgers Columbian to espresso, I prefer it dark roast and I'm not real fussy about coffee like some are.\n\nI won't tell you not to try it, because this blend may suit you fine, it just had a something about it's taste that didn't work for me.

Just because how the heck could I do a real review without doing it. Just like when I used a little creamer though, this coffee is so smooth that it's like the difference between drinking good bottled water instead of from the tap it's so smooth.\n\nIt's pretty dark without the bitter taste that you can get from dark roast at times. Please don't think me crazy, but I use the recommended amount of coffee for 8 cups to make 17 ounces for my morning mug that goes in a 20 ounce mug, so that it's very full with an ounce and a half of creamer like Coffee Mate added, but I often use the cans of evaporated milk also.\n\nIf the coffee isn't good when it's made strong like this, it can be brutal to drink. But the Love Buzz (I like the name too) the Love buzz isn't bitter and it's so free of acid that it seems impossible. I expect acid when I make it so strong and that's why I normally use a dash of creamer.\n\nMy French press is at my other home where I'm not, so I've been using my Gevalia drip with the metal screen as a substitute. This works out pretty well and I've held off on picking up another press, because I've already been here longer than planned. I want to fly back with a bag of the Love Buzz just so that I can press it though because I want to try that so badly.\n\nSo I've got more on the way because as of today, throughout my 35 years of drinking coffee this is my new favorite, just the best.\n\nDon't even think about if you maybe want to try it, it can't be everyone's favorite, but I don't think that you'll be disappointed.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNestle Carnation Instant Nonfat Dry Milk, 25.6-Ounce\nReview:\nI like this dry milk, because I rarely purchase fresh milk.\n\nWhen used correctly it can be substituted in recipes and depending, you probably won't know the difference from skim milk, whole milk is another story though. When mixing this up, first follow the directions and then I add more until it has too much taste from this, and then I just add a little water. I think that it amounts to about 10% more of the powder to taste it's best for me. The actual amount will vary depending on how much you're making, but for my use, I'll often start with 12 oz in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BlenderBottle/dp/B00MVMCUK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BlenderBottle</a>.\n\nBut even when custom blended and left to get cold and mixed again, this is not a good drink to me, and fresh skim milk will also cost less. The price here isn't really all that good, although it's too much when purchasing it in the local grocery stores also.\n\nI'll recommend this purchase for uses like mine, when you sometimes need a little milk and rarely have fresh in your refrigerator.\n\nBecause if you too seldom have a carton of milk in your fridge, this is truly a welcome sight in your cupboard when you need just a little milk right now.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSpice Jungle Five Peppercorn M&eacute;lange - 4 oz.\nReview:\nGreat pepper combo, it turns your food into something like you've never tasted before, or umm, you know what I'm saying here, it's different.\n\nThis isn't as spicy as black pepper to me, but that's alright, because it's having a party on my taste buds and I have a row of hot sauces.

I think that the regular Oreo is just lacking a little, and when I tried Double Stuf, I had to force myself to quit eating them.

I don't eat sugar, artificial sweeteners, refined grains, red meat, or artificial anything, and this cereal tastes sweet and crunchy and nutty to me. I usually eat it with a handful of chopped walnuts, cut up a banana or peach, and add almond milk. It's low on the glycemic index, which is also an enormous plus if you're trying to eat healthy.

You can add various milks and sweeteners, but mostly I take mine straight and think pleasant thoughts.\nBut I'm at a point in my life where sleep isn't a sure thing, and I won't use drugs to make me sleep that would have catastrophic side effects, so I take a cocktail of supplements that are (knock wood) helping me slip into that nether world of dreams and rest, but it comes slowly if at all, and I've tried several herbal blends of chamomile, passion flower, etc., without much success.\nI found this one, while searching for something else and decided what the heck, and ordered it. It's not instant, as in something that will conk me right out, but if I drink it an hour or more before bedtime, it takes the edge off the day. Linden Flower appears to have a ton of benefits, everything from taming high blood pressure, to clearing mucus and yes, treating insomnia.\nI thought I'd look at some other Linden teas, but the Lemon Balm and Hawthorne in this one seem to work together, so I'm not going to try anything else just yet. Also it's organic, which is pretty high on my list of priorities. The taste is about like all herbal teas, grassy, and I definitely don't wake up feeling drugged.

It's definitely helping my digestion issues, and I'm sort of addicted to chewing it. It's not like the gum we usually chew, and there's a bit of a learning curve. You have to test each of the tears by chewing down on it carefully to see how moist or dry it is. Some will break into tiny shards, and some will be so sticky you'll spend the better part of the day cleaning it off your teeth. I've found that what works best for me is to save a little piece of my gum from the previous day, start chewing it to get it softened back up, and then add a piece or two of new Mastic Tears to it.

I'm post menopausal, and I'm trying to get my HRT on a moon phase schedule, so I plan to begin drinking this only on the 4th week of my cycle to see if it will help balance my hormones, which have been a mess since my surgery nearly 20 years ago, even with compounded bio-identical hormone cream.

She knew that I have a Keurig 35 B30 Mini Brewer (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Keurig-35-B30-Mini-Personal-Single-Serve-Brewing-System-Black/dp/B001CTXWM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Keurig 35 B30 Mini Personal Single-Serve Brewing System, Black</a>) at work.  I make at least two cups of coffee in the morning and sometimes one in the afternoon if I'm feeling sleepy.  (I work two jobs and I am sleep deprived.)  I've had this Keurig brewer for at least three years and I couldn't live without it.  However, disposable K-Cups are expensive; this is why I purchased the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Keurig-My-K-Cup-Reusable-Coffee-Filter/dp/B000DLB2FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>).  At the time, I thought it was wonderful.  It is a three-piece unit.  A removable filter sits inside the reusable K-cup which has a top that screws on.  Also, the Keurig brewer's filter holder has to be removed in order to insert the Keurig Reusable Filter.  There is always the possibility that this filter holder could be damaged or lost.\n\n  On a daily basis, I've been using the Solofill Reusable K-Cup for over seven months.  It is much easier to operate and clean than the Keurig Reusable Filter.  Also, the coffee tastes just as great; I use my favorite Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored&nbsp;].  There are never any grounds in my coffee.  My only concern was that the plastic hinge that connects the lid with the reusable K-Cup's body would eventually break but it hasn't.  There are not any visible cracks, tears, shreds, etc.  It looks nearly as good as when it was given to me as a Christmas gift.  I no longer use my Keurig Reusable Filter, but I haven't thrown it away in case my Solofill Reusable K-Cup is lost or stolen.  Several times I've accidentally left it in the break room after washing it.  I could afford to buy another one.  The Solofill Reusable K-Cup costs the same as a Keurig Reusable Filter.  If you own one of the many varieties of Keurig single-serving brewing systems, then I highly recommend buying the Solofill Reusable K-Cup; it is easy to use, saves money and is very durable!\n\nJoseph B.

It looks like coarse white sugar dyed brown, or dark brown sugar that's loose and dry.  It smells like the husk of a coconut and tastes sweet and nutty.\n\nI baked a batch of cookies - half using regular sugar cane sugar, the other half using coconut sugar.  Then, I asked the family to compare without telling them which was which.  They chose because they had to, my husband asking if it was a trick question.  In the end, my daughter like the coconut sugar cookies.  My husband and son chose the white sugar cookies.  Like the rest of my family, I honestly couldn't tell the difference.\n\nI made chicken wings in the oven.  It's a recipe I've used for years using soy sauce, honey, and sugar.  This time, I substituted coconut sugar.  Here, the difference was noticeable.  I could smell and taste the bolder, nuttier flavor.  I didn't tell the family I had changed the recipe, though, and no one commented on it.\n\nI'm going to keep experimenting with coconut sugar.  It's not going to replace my sugar cane sugar, because there are times when I don't want that nutty flavor or brown color coming through.  It's a definite green light for cookies, as no one can tell it's even there.\n\nThis product was provided for review by Viva Labs.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nOrganic Chocolate Chip Pancake and Waffle Mix by Birch Benders, Whole Grain, Non-GMO, 16oz\nReview:\nI served these to my family last night and they got an overwhelming thumbs up  for their hint of cinnamon.  One bag can feed a typical family, but my family's not typical because my husband can eat A LOT, so I had to make an additional 7 pancakes after using up the whole bag.  It's very easy.  Just add water.  Those are the best kind of pancakes.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSpectrum Culinary Organic Unrefined Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 fl. oz.

I'm using it on my skin and lips, which makes me smell like the tropics.  The only problem is I can't seal up the packet.  There's way more in it than I'll ever need for one application.  Still better than dipping my hand in a tub, though.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSpectrum Culinary Organic Unrefined Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 fl. oz. (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nI was looking forward to something the size of a jar of hand cream.  What I got could compete with a can of Crisco.  But lard, this is not.  Nope, it's too runny to be lard, and too thick to be oil.  I guess I could use it for cosmetic purposes, but that would mean dipping my hand in it.  Instead, I fried up some sausage.  This stuff heats up well and fries great.  I'm no fan of coconut flavors, but this didn't taste like coconut at all.  I like it, but I wish it came in a squeeze bottle.  It's about the right consistency for that.\n\n_____________\n\nUPDATE 5/19/16:  After cooking up some foods with milder flavors, yes, I can taste the coconut.

I told my husband the kids won't eat it.  That's okay, he said.  He'll eat it himself.  Well, what do you know?  I underestimated the whole family.  Even my pickiest eater son has munched on his fair share.  My daughter says she likes them.  My husband is keeping his promise, and yes, I'm doing what I can to help out.  These are soft, chewy granola bars, not the crunchy sort.  All that chocolate makes them more cookie than whole earth healthy, but then they're only 100 Calories or less per each.

Who cares?  They were way delicious.  He even finished off two packs on our plan ride--and they are exactly the size of snack packs we get on planes.

They have a delicious, tart flavor.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNavitas Organics Cacao Nibs, 8 oz. Bag &mdash; Organic, Non-GMO, Fair Trade, Gluten-Free\nReview:\nFor those who want to get all the benefits of dark chocolate without any processing, this is for you. These are raw, natural \"nibs\" of cacao. They aren't sweet like chocolate candy, and they can take some getting used to, but you don't need to eat a lot of this food to get the health benefits, only about a half teaspoonful of them per day.\n\nOver the last four years there have been dozens of scientific studies analyzing and confirming substantial health benefits from a small amount of dark chocolate consumed daily. The latest findings from a Harvard study released in early 2011 indicate that as little as 6 gm. of dark chocolate (about 30 calories) is a sufficient daily \"dose.\" That means you need very little of pure chocolate like these nibs.\n\nThe original German studies in 2007 used&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ritter-Sport-dark-chocolate/dp/B000PAM5DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ritter Sport dark chocolate</a>, but I haven't so far been able to discover which kind of Ritter's dark chocolate was used by the researchers. However, since Ritter's only makes two types, 50% cacao and 71% cacao, this product's content of cacao goes far beyond the parameters of the dark chocolate used in that study.\n\nThe health benefits of dark chocolate are due to the flavonoids contained in cocoa. Flavonoids act as antioxidants in the body, which both prevent and reduce inflammation. Over many years of medical research, inflammation has been found to contribute to or directly cause a host of diseases, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and cancer, as well as autoimmune diseases like arthritis.\n\nFlavonoids are found in the pigments of fruits and vegetables which give them their color. The darker and deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the greater the amount of flavonoids it contains. Cocoa is derived from the dark-brown cacao bean, which is the fruit of the tropical tree, theobroma cacao. In any chocolate product, such as this one, the higher the percentage of cocoa/cacao, the more flavonoids the chocolate contains.\n\nDark chocolate such as this product is better for your health than milk chocolate because it contains more antioxidants, which are good for you, and less sugar, which is not good for you--especially if you have diabetes or are struggling with your weight.\n\nThe FDA defines categories of chocolate based on how much cocoa/cacao is in a given product:\n1. Unsweetened chocolate with no additives is 100% cocoa. Most all brands of unsweetened baker's chocolate fall into this category. Their ingredient list will state simply, \"chocolate.\" This product is unprocessed cacao.\n2. Bittersweet chocolate contains 35-99% cocoa (35% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. There is a large range of products in this category, and the product names reflect the amount of chocolate they contain. Unsweetened chocolate is very bitter, and the more cocoa in a product, the less room for sugar, and the more bitter it will be. In order to avoid frightening off customers who are used to sweet chocolate, marketers often substitute the words \"dark,\" \"extra dark\" or \"intense\" for \"bitter\" if that word is not paired with \"sweet,\" for example as \"bittersweet\" or \"extra bittersweet.\" This product lies at the top of this range.\n3. Sweet chocolate contains 15-34% cocoa (15% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. It is sometimes also marketed as \"dark chocolate,\" even though it has a much lower percentage of cocoa solids than bittersweet, which can cause consumers, in such cases, to purchase a product with less cocoa in it than they realized they were getting. Everything else besides the cocoa and milk solids is essentially sugar.\n4. Milk chocolate is only required to have a minimum of 10% cocoa, a minimum of 12% milk solids and 3.39% milk fat. The rest is sugar and milk.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSincerely Nuts Dried Pineapple Chunks - Two Lb.

I was interested to see that this flour has far, far less fat in it than ground up coconut flakes. I can only assume that this is because the coconut pulp that is dried to be ground into flour has first been squeezed to remove coconut oil, which is sold separately.\n\nI use this flour in muffins, soup, and vegan ice cream. It tastes almost as good as ground up coconut flakes for these three purposes, and it saves a lot of calories.\n\nMy recipe for a really creamy, delicious, tropical ice cream is:\n\n1 ripe mango, peeled\n1 ripe banana, peeled\n5 large frozen strawberries\n1 cup fresh or canned pineapple, pre-frozen in ice cube tray\n1/2 cup coconut flour\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract (I make my own)\n1 teaspoon stevia powder\n1-1/2 to 2 cups frozen ice cubes (I freeze green tea that I have sweetened to taste with stevia)\n\nI blend all the non-frozen ingredients in my Vitamix first. Then I gradually add in the frozen ingredients, blending on high until it is well mixed and the consistency of a Dairy Queen Blizzard. Yum!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGarden of Life Greens and Protein Powder - Organic Raw Protein and Greens with Probiotics/Enzymes, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Chocolate 22oz (1lb 6oz/611g) Powder\nReview:\nThis is a high-quality, meal-replacement supplement. It tastes pretty good for a vegan product. Every vegan protein powder I've ever tried has been really awful tasting. This product does have a somewhat grainy texture, however, it mixes well using a mini-whisk or a fork, and of course there is no problem at all if you use a blender. I mixed it into room-temperature, purified water, and I did not feel the need to try it at a later time with herbal tea or almond milk to improve the taste, as I do with regular, vegan protein powder. It tasted fine just with water.\n\nThis product is certified USDA organic and non-GMO. It is vegan, Kosher, dairy-free, and soy-free. It also contains probiotics, enzymes and fiber. It is sweetened with stevia, and has no bitter aftertaste. In short, there are no bad ingredients at all and plenty of excellent ones.\n\nThis product is fairly expensive, at about $1.50 per serving, but that's not too bad as far as healthy, meal-replacement products go. I found it quite filling.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Natural Products Organic Bac'Uns Bacon Flavored Soy Bits - 1 lb\nReview:\nThese are a delicious, organic version of soy, vegan, fake-bacon bits.

I had not used mini chips before, and they work great for better distribution of chips throughout the chocolate chip cookies I made. Below is the recipe I used, which is one I developed for myself after a lot of experimenting with ways to avoid using sugar yet still have cookies taste sweet. I have included some pictures of the cookies I baked as well as what the dough looks like when made in a food processor. I will definitely purchase these chocolate chips again!\n\nVegan Chocolate Chip Cookies\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees.\n\nMix these dry ingredients together well or sift them together if preferred:\n\n2 cups whole wheat pastry flour\n2 tsp. stevia\n1 tsp. baking powder\n1/4 tsp. sea salt\n\nPuree in food processor:\n\n1 medium, peeled and cored apple (or 1/2 cup applesauce)\n60 gm pitted dates\n1/2 cup coconut oil\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract (I make my own)\n1/4 cup maple syrup\n\nGradually add in 1/2 of the dry ingredients to the pureed mixture in the food processor.\nRemove the pureed mixture from the food processor and place in a bowl.\nStir in the rest of the dry mixture and add last:\n\n1 cup Enjoy Life Semi-Sweet Chocolate Mini-Chips\n\nFor convenience, I use my toaster oven rather than turning on my regular-sized oven (easier to deal with and uses less electricity). As stated above, I preheat my toaster oven to 325 degrees. I use a 1-tablespoon-size melon-ball scoop to measure out balls of cookie dough onto a greased silicone baking sheet which is specifically sized for a toaster oven. I press the cookie-dough balls flat. I then bake the cookies on the toaster-oven rack on its top level for 9-10 minutes. The cookies have a moist and chewy texture.\n\nThis recipe makes about 44 cookies at approximately 75 calories each.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMrs Dash Garlic &amp; Herb Salt Free Blend, 6.75-ounce\nReview:\nI'm a big fan of all of the Mrs Dash spice blends, but this is my all-time favorite.

I'd have to ask, \"compared to what?\"  I have been paying $55.00 for another brand and yes, that brand tastes less chalky to me, but still Vega is doing what I need it to do, it fulfills all the requirements I had,and so as long as they don't change up the formula, I most likely will continue to buy this product.\n\nI also forgot to mention it dissolves very easily, not many protein powders do, at least not without a blender or bullet type device.  The Vega Protein & Greens dissolves easily with just a shake or two.  That's a nice PLUS.\n\nUPdate:\n\nThe price has gone up $9.00 since I bought the first one.

I'm a coconut oil fanatic.  The one thing I DO NOT use this type oil for is my essential oils.... I buy a cheaper version for that one application.\n\nIsland Fresh Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, so far, has passed all my tests of what I will buy more than once....

But if you're \"willing\" to try other items to sweeten things, then certainly I think Stevia Supreme is worth a try.\n\nI found out about this product fist by doing a Google search on Truvia, and read a great article about that. . . and that's where I found out about Stevia, and why it's a \"dietary supplement\".\n\nSo. . . I came to Amazon.com and found Stevia Supreme.  I read the reviews and decided to try it. . . and I'm glad I did!\n\nWhen I first put some on my finger and tasted it. . . YUCK!

A handful of almonds or a banana are easy to store in my desk, but don't always sound appealing. Chocolate fudge, though? It always sounds good. So, I was a bit skeptical about these Sensa Chews simply because I was worried I'd eat one and then end up still hungry and end up eating another and another and another. My first look at the individually wrapped chews in their packaging only added to my concern. They look quite a bit like those Storck&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/RIESEN-Chewy-Caramels-Chocolate-2-65-Ounce-Pack-of-12/dp/B006JWQG1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">RIESEN Chewy Caramels, Chocolate, 2.65-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>. They're wrapped in the same type of parchment type paper, have the same color, and are similarly sized. When I was feeling junk food cravings coming on between lunch and dinner, I unwrapped one of these chocolate confections....and instantly knew that overindulgence would NOT be a problem.\n\nThe taste of these chews isn't awful at all, but it's also not the taste of chocolate fudge. It's not even like a weak tootsie roll. It's a hint of something akin to chocolate without actually being chocolaty. That said, it's not bad, and it doesn't have any aftertaste whatsoever. What it does have is a sort of weird texture. Don't ask me how I know this, but the texture of the chew is actually quite like the texture you get when you're chewing a wad of gum and then take a bite of peanut butter (seriously, I don't know how I know this texture, but it's what instantly came to mind). The chew is very soft and very easy to chew, but it almost immediately starts to disintegrate as you are chewing. It goes from almost smooth to incredibly gritty, then sort of dissolves. And, while it's easy to chew, it's not a quick chew. It doesn't hurt the jaw at all, but it does require maybe a minute or two of chewing to fully dissolve. The package carries a warning label that you need to drink it with at least 8 ounces of water or risk choking, but I found that it went down quite easily enough (and I always take one with a full bottle of water so that I just don't have to worry about it).\n\nAs far as suppressing my appetite, I think the Sensa Chews worked pretty well at this. Granted, I was still hungry, and still wanted something to eat after taking one, but it was more psychological than physical. And when I did eat afterward, I think I didn't gorge like I might do when I've gone all day without eating and then suddenly have a chance to get to something. Honestly, I might also be just as satisfied with a banana or a handful of almonds, but those get boring after a while, and despite my best intentions, I never remember to bring them to work with me (or the banana turns black or the bag of almonds that are supposed to be for emergencies end up getting all eaten on the same day I bring them). In any case, these chews are quite simple to keep in my desk and handy as well. I like them well enough, but I do wish that there were other flavor options besides the chocolate and berry available; I'd be willing to give them a try.\nRating:\n3.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Always ready, you don't have to think to soak them the night before.  They can be tossed into just about any vegetable dish for protein and flavor. They love garlic and good olive oil for seasoning.  If you like dips, they'd make a great base.  At just over $2.00 a can, the Amazon price on these is great, too.  No BPA in the can, and Eden Foods is a wonderful little company that I feel good supporting.  (No, I don't own or work for Eden Foods.  Don't even know anyone who works there.

I hesitated to review this for selfish reason because I want it to be in stock when I want to order more. I am so excited that I could find it on Amazon.  Previously, I would only order my olive oil from a company in California, but for this olive oil I overcome my environmental scruples and buy something shipped in from another country. I am an experienced cook. I am blown away by the flavor of this olive oil.  For those having trouble will spillage, pull the spout up straight until it is fully extended before you twist off the cap.  This is a good, useful cap.

The flavors are coconut vanilla, double chocolate, wild blueberry and original.  When I was preparing these I immediately knew these mixes were different than the Hungry Jack mix you add water to.  I normally serve Hungry Jack, so my kids were in for a surprise!  Maybe if my kids had the Bunnery Natural Food pancakes first before they ever tried the Hungry Jack mix, these would have been better received.  This mix is a healthier version of Hungry Jack and includes oats, sunflower seeds and millet.  It's very hearty! The directions on these mixes have you add 2/3 cup of milk, an egg and 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  I'm fine with that, but even after adding these ingredients the mix seemed really thick!  So I added a bit more milk.  They baked nicely and were very thick!  I would make them smaller next time and it yielded 6 pancakes for me, instead of 5 pancakes like it says on the back of the package.\n\nHere are some of the family comments when they were served:\n\"I thought these were blueberry pancakes.  I don't see any blueberries.\"\n\"These are crunchy!\"\n\"I'm stuffed.\"\n\nThese pancakes are very filling and have 6 grams of protein in them, so these are \"stick with you\" pancakes and that is a plus for me, since it seems like my kids are always hungry.  The blueberry, coconut vanilla and original pancakes would be improved if you added fresh or frozen blueberries.  The chocolate flavored mix might be better with some chocolate chips added.  These are healthy pancakes and they taste like it too.  With a little doctoring up, these mixes will be a hit!  We will try them again as I like to encourage my children to eat healthier food.\nRating:\n3.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It's not bad per se, I like bitter but this spice did not seem 'rounded' and pleasant on its own to me.  There's no aftertaste that I can detect and my food still tastes good using it, but I can tell it's not the usual brand I buy.\n\nI bought this to get bulk for the money since I blow through Turmeric at a ridiculous rate.  I use A LOT of the stuff, in just about everything savory to assist with joint health and because I love the taste of turmeric.  I also love the color it imparts to food.  I will finish the package but will likely try another brand the next go around.\n\nIf I had to pick between having this and none, I would buy again.  Because of the price point, I likely will buy again, many times, just not as a first choice.\n\nI will update this review after I've had a chance to try the tea recipes listed in other reviews.

Because it's 100% coconut water, no sugar added and not from concentrate (tetra packs), it tastes so good.  I don't mind pulp, but I like the ease of not having to strain the water to give to my finicky toddler.  There is no pulp in this particular Zico Natural Coconut Water 6 pack.\n\nThe 2% does make a difference.  I didn't even know my old brand was not 100% until I tasted how good and better Zico was.  I then grabbed a container of my old brand and read the ingredients.  I was surprised that I was paying for 2% water in each container.\n\nI periodically buy coconuts from a local, natural food store so I am familiar with what virgin coconut water should taste like.  I appreciate that processing of Zico Natural flavor seems minimal.  It feels like it's hydrating the moment I swallow it, whether room temperature or cold, just like the coconuts I 'tap' myself.\n\nZico Natural flavor tastes so good, expensive though.  I search for sales at Amazon and my local grocery stores, then stock up!\n\nHope this helps.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nO.N.E. Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI love coconut water and have been drinking it regularly for at least 5 years but probably more.  Lately, I buy the near expiration date coconut water for the affordability and because with Zico, it still tastes good (so far).  I must say though, that my recent purchase of this O.N.E coconut water in the 11.2 oz aseptic containers tasted so bad that I had to force myself to drink it down.  The expiration is not until August, 2013, which is 2 months away.  Still, I had to mix one container of this with 2 11.2 OZ containers of sweetened coconut water just to get it palatable enough to get it down.  The Zico on the other hand, expires this month, but still tastes good.\n\nI will not order this particular O.N.E brand again, at least not close to expiration.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nLundberg Eco-Farmed Sweet Dreams Brown Rice Syrup - 21 Ounce - 1 Pack\nReview:\nNew to brown rice syrup.

NOW brand left the tea clear.\n\nI prefer the NOW brand in hot tea but prefer this for baking, cooking and as a topping (sweet potato, krispy treats, popcorn, greek yogurt, etc.)  It has a more complex and buttery background which is better suited to such applications.\n\nDELICIOUS.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHonest Tea Organic Fair Trade Pomegranate Blue Gluten Free, 16.9 Fl.

They smell wonderful, I plan to make a Calendula infusion oil with them.

Make sure THOROUGHLY DRY, INTRODUCE NO MOISTURE OR THE RISK OF MOLD AND MILDEW IS HIGH.  Put any amount of the flowers you want in the jar (most use 1/2 - 3/4) and cover with a good carrier oil (olive oil, sweet almond oil, etc.)  Let sit in a window that gets sun for about 6-8 weeks or until the oil is a nice, golden yellow.  Some recipes say to shake the mixture every once in a while.  When the oil looks good to you (orangish-yellow), strain over cheesecloth into a sterile jar.  Voila, calendula herbal oil.\n\nI sent my mother a bag, and she is making the oil.

The salt really *is* black and as you take pinches of it from jar to sprinkle on the food, it will turn your fingers black as if you had handled charcoal. It is absolutely delicious on fish and seafood, and I never eat my salmon with anything but this Das Foods salt. Das Foods salts, all I have purchased, are all fine quality and this is one of the best lava salts I've had.

This works wonderfully on all my others, Cranberry apple, cranberry hibiscus, blueberry aa and others. I did the double bag with this, expecting a good distinct flavor like the others give me for two bags. Nope. It was very watery and insipid. It had a vague lemon taste, but so weak and watered down.\n\n I was so excited to try this, I love a good lemon taste in anything. This was horribly disappointing and I have to say, my sister agrees. I gave her a box from my six pack. I will try three bags per cup and see how that is. I hope it will be much better, as I am stuck with five boxes of this tasteless lemon water.\n\nUpdate:  I tried to three-bag it in mug. I got much more lemon flavor, which would have been great had there not been a lot more mint flavor. I. Hate. Mint. Tea. Who does that? Mint and lemon?

She knew that I have a Keurig 35 B30 Mini Brewer (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Keurig-35-B30-Mini-Personal-Single-Serve-Brewing-System-Black/dp/B001CTXWM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Keurig 35 B30 Mini Personal Single-Serve Brewing System, Black</a>) at work.  I make at least two cups of coffee in the morning and sometimes one in the afternoon if I'm feeling sleepy.  (I work two jobs and I am sleep deprived.)  I've had this Keurig brewer for at least three years and I couldn't live without it.  However, disposable K-Cups are expensive; this is why I purchased the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Keurig-My-K-Cup-Reusable-Coffee-Filter/dp/B000DLB2FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>).  At the time, I thought it was wonderful.  It is a three-piece unit.  A removable filter sits inside the reusable K-cup which has a top that screws on.  Also, the Keurig brewer's filter holder has to be removed in order to insert the Keurig Reusable Filter.  There is always the possibility that this filter holder could be damaged or lost.\n\n  On a daily basis, I've been using the Solofill Reusable K-Cup for over seven months.  It is much easier to operate and clean than the Keurig Reusable Filter.  Also, the coffee tastes just as great; I use my favorite Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored&nbsp;].  There are never any grounds in my coffee.  My only concern was that the plastic hinge that connects the lid with the reusable K-Cup's body would eventually break but it hasn't.  There are not any visible cracks, tears, shreds, etc.  It looks nearly as good as when it was given to me as a Christmas gift.  I no longer use my Keurig Reusable Filter, but I haven't thrown it away in case my Solofill Reusable K-Cup is lost or stolen.  Several times I've accidentally left it in the break room after washing it.  I could afford to buy another one.  The Solofill Reusable K-Cup costs the same as a Keurig Reusable Filter.  If you own one of the many varieties of Keurig single-serving brewing systems, then I highly recommend buying the Solofill Reusable K-Cup; it is easy to use, saves money and is very durable!\n\nJoseph B.

I got a bag of Pamela's by accident (a place I order supplements and organic foods online mistakingly sent me a bag with my order), and I'm not one to throw away food so I made pancakes and wow...they were really good. I have my own pancake recipe (made with fresh ground wheat) that we love, but these were seriously *almost* just as good. You would have no idea they are not \"regular\" pancakes just by looking at them or tasting them.\n\nI'm a very from scratch type cook and make pretty much everything (breads, ketchup, crackers, etc.) myself, but let me tell you, I will keep a bag of Pamela's around for when I'm feeling like a bit lazy and wanting a quick breakfast for the family. Highly recommend!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCelestial Seasonings Victorian Earl Grey Tea, 25 Count\nReview:\nI like the flavor of this tea. It has a pumpkin taste that's not covered up by the spices. With that being said, I'm removing two stars because of the bitter aftertaste of stevia. I wish they would leave it out completely. I have to add sugar to cut the bitterness, and for health reasons I prefer not to add sugar to tea. Because of having to add sugar, unfortunately this won't be a tea I drink very often, which is a shame since its the only pumpkin tea I can find that actually tastes like pumpkin rather than chai.\n\n***Updated: So I'm through one entire box of this and my opinion has been downgraded a bit. Each cup I enjoyed less and less. Of course that's because a friend gave me a few bags of Bigelow Pumpkin Spice tea which blows this out of the water and no bitter aftertaste. So while I think this tea is worth a try (we all have different tastes afterall), it's not one I will be buying again.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nStash Tea Jasmine Blossom Green Tea, 20 Count Tea Bags in Foil (Pack of 6) Medium Caffeine Tea, Green Tea Blended with Jasmine Flowers\nReview:\nJasmine green tea is a favorite of mine and this one is pretty good.

I tried it the way I usually make my coffee and it was great, but then I decided to add another packet of Splenda and now it is to die for.  It's a little pricey but well worth the extra. It has a true chocolate flavor. If you are someone who prefers dark chocolate flavor then just add less sweetener.  This is a nice alternative to hot chocolate for me. Although it is strong on chocolate it doesn't take away from the coffee taste.

My boxes have all arrived in excellent condition, maybe that depends a lot on the carrier. (Mine are delivered by UPS, in our area if something is delivered by USPS - local mail - packages seem to get thrown around a lot.  The taste is excellent. At first I thought I might be indulging a little bit, but the truth is by comparison of buying half n half at the grocery it is actually cheaper considering the times I throw away part of a quart.  If I buy it by the pint, I find I have to go to the grocery too often and being disabled this saves me that extra trip.  I keep a container full of these in the refrigerator because I like cold half n half in my coffee to cool it down more quickly.  I was concerned at first that I would not use these up within three months; but I do and occasionally decide to add a little half n half to something else I am preparing.  At 10 calories per little container, I really am not adding too many calories to what I am preparing. Particularly I like it added at room temperature to a rice dish when serving it.  (this is when I am glad that some of my containers are not refrigerated)  These are perfect, real half n half for my coffee.  Not so much for tea as it makes it too rich and I am one who prefers milk in tea but I have found if I add as much water as I add half n half it usually works out. In three months I would spend a lot more money on half n half from the grocery so it is really a saving, not just a convenience.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStash Tea Decaf Chocolate Hazelnut Tea 18 Count Tea Bags in Foil (Pack of 6) Individual Decaffeinated Black Tea Bags for Use in Teapots Mugs or Cups, Brew Hot Tea or Iced Tea\nReview:\nFirst I wish Amazon would separate the reviews for Stash teas based on flavors rather than lumping them all together.

I tend to prefer black and white teas.  Mighty Leaf's Green Tea Tropical is one significant exception for me.  I love this tea.  I often find that green tea tastes too grassy or plant-like for me- not the case for this tea.  Green Tea Tropical has a good, fruity flavor, and it's exceptionally smooth, and not at all bitter.  I suspect this might have a bit more flavor than your average flavored green tea, which may be a plus or minus depending on your tastes.  For me that's a good thing.  Even though the flavor is strong, it's delicate and well-balanced.  This tea does not taste like a giant fruit salad, though the fruity notes are certainly distinct.  Now, for the rating.  The reason I gave this 4 stars is that this is a *very* expensive tea.  More expensive than some other gourmet teas.  Yes, it's a very nice cup, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay the price for it, when there are some other very good teas on the market at much lower prices.  It's clear that some of the money goes into teabag construction, as the bag itself is very high quality.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Despite the cost, they are a good deal for anyone who can't eat wheat or gluten.  They taste delicious, and as several others have noted, are just as good, if not better than regular pretzels.  It's hard for me to find these even in the Twin Cities, so I will very happily be buying them through Amazon.  I have tried and used many Ener-G brand products over the years.  These are among the best.  I find their breads dry, tasteless, and unappealing in the extreme, but the pretzels  are awesome.  Other brands have an off taste, but not these.  They are wonderful and I will buy them frequently. Even my gluten eating family enjoys these, so I hide them!

If you haven't had blue raspberry Jolly Ranchers they are a great hard candy that is colorful, flavorful, and has the perfect combination of sweet and tart. I'm assuming that most people have tried them, so Ill spend my time on reviewing the packaging. I absolutely love the size for a party.  I didn't count the candy, but the nutrition label says each serving is 3 pieces and it contains ~139 servings. That's over 400 pieces of candy; All in one bag! No need to buy or open multiple packages. It's perfect for my use (filling a pi&ntilde;ata) or would be great for Halloween. Each piece is individually wrapped.

She has had Earl Grey from around the world, even returning from a recent trip to England where she had many opportunities to have Earl Grey. Her response after tasting this tea was, \"This is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted in my whole life.\"\n\nThis tea can be made strong and flavorful without becoming bitter. The flavor is perfect and clean in both hot and iced. I cannot complain about any aspect of the tea.\n\nIt comes loose leaf. We brewed it in a Teavana PerfectTea tea maker. Here are our recommendations for the perfect cup using 200 degree water:\n  -HOT: Use the recommended 1.5 teaspoons of tea brewed for about 4 minutes.\n  -Iced:  Use 3 teaspoons brewed for 5 minutes.\n\nThe problem with many black teas is that they get bitter especially when brewed for ice tea, because you need a stronger tea so it doesn't dilute. We didn't have that problem at all with this. Tattle Tea has become our tea of choice from now on for Earl Grey.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeanut Butter &amp; Co.

If you watch \"Good Eats\" on the Food Network, you've seen Alton Brown praise steel-cut oats and dis rolled oats (the \"Quaker Oatmeal\" stuff). I personally love rolled oats, but if you don't, don't let that stop you from buying the McCann's. The texture, the taste, the \"oomph\" are nothing like your ordinary breakfast oats. Where rolled Quaker oats are a bit slippery and thin, these steel-cut oats are much firmer with a lot more tooth and a much heartier, nuttier flavor.\n\nBe aware that you have to invest a little time to cook this cereal -- half an hour on the stovetop. Or try boiling the water the previous night, turning off the heat, and then putting the oats in to sit overnight. Then finish cooking them in the morning for 10 minutes or so. There are other shortcuts, too -- try a Google search. Whichever way you try, you may be spoiled for other hot cereals forever.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It has only 60 calories per tablespoon compared to 120.  It has a nice tang to it and a very agreeable texture.  It does have a lighter mouth feel than the full fat version, but I actually prefer that.  Too me, regular mayo can get pretty heavy too easily, and I don't like that overly fatty taste.\n\nI like that it is made with eggs from cage-free hens.  I'm aware that cage-free is still not ideal, but it is a step in the right direction.  Hmmmm, I just reread the label.  It says, \"We are on a mission to use 100% cage free eggs in everything we make, and we are pleased to say that we are well on our way.\"  So, is this made with 100% eggs from cage-free hens or not?\n\nI like that it is made with olive oil, but be aware that olive oil is the second oil used.  Soybean oil is the predominant one, something not discerned by looking just at the front of the package.\n\nI like the bottle design, not having to use a knife or spoon to get out a dollop of mayo.  The plastic seems very lightweight, less material to go into recycling bins.\n\nOverall I really love the taste of this product, and its lower calorie count.  I gave it 4 stars instead of five because:\n\n1.)  It's made predominately with soybean oil instead of olive oil and that is not made obvious by looking at the label without also reading the little ingredient list.\n\n2.) It is not clear whether this specific product is made with all eggs from cage-free hens.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I don't know if it is the plastic jar that it is in that has tainted the flavor or if it is just the oil itself, but this oil has an edge to the taste of it that is off some how, almost as though it is slightly rancid.

As others have mentioned in their reviews, the flavor is great and the ingredients/nutrition are better.  Hold on, though:  there's a \"but\" coming.\n\nRemember the flavored instant oatmeal we ate before we knew what \"organic\" or \"gluten\" meant?  Brightly colored \"banana\" bits held onto their fake yellow color and their cubic shape long after the hot water mushified the oats for us.  We ate fake crap, and we liked it.\n\nWe're older and wiser now, and want real bananas:  real bananas that we re-hydrate ourselves with our steaming hot filtered water for optimum health and enjoyment.\n\nExcept that rehydrated banana bits don't stay in bit form.  Nor do they rehydrate to sliced banana consistency.  Nay!  Rehydrated banana bits taste like delicious, wholesome bananas, and have the consistency of runny snot.\n\nThat's right:  runny snot.\n\nI love everything else about this oatmeal, but when I want to feel snot run down my throat, I'll go out and contract the common cold, thank you very much.\n\nBased on other reviews, this doesn't throw everyone.  Based on other reviews, you might love this oatmeal and shrug off the banana snot texture without a second thought.  But if you're a huge texture snob, I thought you might want to know what you're getting into.\n\nI will shudder and finish the rest of my banana oatmeal one snot-filled bowl at a time (unless I can't take it anymore, at which point the food bank gets a wholesome and delicious donation), but I won't purchase this again.  I think I'll slice bananas into gluten-free oatmeal the next time I feel a bananas-and-cream craving.\n\nBest of luck with your oatmeal experience, and thank you for pausing to read a different perspective.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nKaren's Naturals Organic Just Blueberries, 2 Ounce Pouch Organic All Natural Freeze-Dried Fruits &amp; Vegetables, No Additives or Preservatives, Non-GMO\nReview:\nHey, these are good!\n\nOk, I wasn't terribly surprised by how good these are:  I love freeze-dried fruit, I love blueberries, and I've never detected an \"off\" taste in Just Tomatoes products.  Some freeze-dried fruit smells and tastes like a factory for some reason, and seems to be a brand-specific problem.\n\nThese are nicely crunchy and nicely flavorful, but have a tamer flavor than some other dried food.  They taste a little cooked:  like homemade blueberry jam, actually, which is what I pretended I was eating.\n\nThere are only 2 servings in the nice big pouch, even though it felt more like 8.  I love that it's hard to over-indulge on these.\n\nThey stain my fingers!  I was surprised that berries without juice can do that, but these do!\n\nThey're a little smaller than Kix pieces.  I did get one bad or burnt one in the whole bag (I didn't spit it out to check, sorry!), but unless I find more in subsequent orders, I wouldn't worry about it too much.\n\nHope you enjoy these as much as I do!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBetter Oats mmmMuffins Old Fashion Instant Oatmeal, Blueberry Flavor, 5 Pouches per 7.55-oz. Box (Pack of 3 Boxes)\nReview:\nThis is delicious.  Steaming fresh blueberry muffins with that dipped-sugar crust top flavor with only 2 minutes of microwave time and no mixing?  Amazing.  Mine blew up in the microwave and the tiny office kitchen smelled like a whole rack of muffins baking even though there's no oven in there.\n\nOf course, the \"natural and artificial flavors\" help.\n\nI would ignore the artificial flavors and continue eating this convenient breakfast favorite if not for the my wheat-senses tingling.  I handle gluten better than most celiac sufferers, but this oatmeal really set me off.  Many of the other \"Better Oats\" deliberately have wheat in them.  This doesn't, but I suspect it has a fair bit by accident.  My condolences to other wheat-free folk, as this is quite possibly the most delicious oatmeal I've ever eaten.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBare Natural Apple Chips, Cinnamon, Gluten Free + Baked, Single Serve Bag - 1.7 Oz (10 Count)\nReview:\nWhen I had more time, I dehydrated apple chips and my coworker/friends gobbled them up and went looking for more.\n\nI have significantly less time now, and I'm trying to lay off eating sugary dried fruit all day, but I couldn't resist buying these with an Amazon coupon.\n\nApple Cinnamon flavor:  way better than some truly funky tasting freeze-dried fruit we've had lately.  Funky Monkey comes to mind, but it's unfair to pick them out because I can't remember the other one that was also so bad I threw it away without even offering it to the college students, who will eat practically everything.\n\nSea Salt Caramel:  The added caramel flavor is pretty subtle.  If you want to eat some caramels, you'll be disappointed.  That said?  These are pretty good!  The flavor isn't consistent, so you get the occasional Mmmmmmm piece in a sea of normal-tasting (and still delicious) apple chips.  I was going to avoid the extra sugar in these, but they're 46 grams of sugar to the plain one's 42 grams.  Not a huge difference, there.  They're also 200 calories/bag compared to 180 calories/bag for the plain ones.  If the sugar or calorie count is really important, however, you'll need to read your own bag.  These things change!\n\nThis has a *little* of that factory-floor taste, which I presume is nitrogen or another low-humidity, low-oxygen air replacement, and it dissipates pretty quickly.  I recommend letting it oxygenate for a minute or two before you dig in, as nitrogen is harmless but can taste really \"off\" to us.  (the same concept applies to letting a nitrogen-packed steak air in the fridge for 15-30 minutes before you cook it).  Of course, dried-to-a-crisp fruits will get soft and lose their crunch if you leave them out, so consider resealing the little bags in a sandwich bag or a small plastic container, squeezing out as much air as you can without crushing the chips.  I have now tried all flavors, and the Sea Salt Caramel is the only one that had any trace of this initial unpleasant flavor.\n\nChili Lime:  This stole the show at game night last night.  Everyone wanted to try it, even the paleo kids who usually eschew cane sugar.  The consensus:  \"Wow, that is really weird, and really GOOD!\"\n\nAdmittedly, I could taste the lime but not the cayenne.  I am on my own in this: the other gamers all tasted it and loved it.  I'm unlikely to buy these very often, but I'll have to try adding lime and cayenne to my homemade apple chips.\n\nFuji Apple Flavor:  Sweet, crunchy, good.  I reached for this for some sugar cravings, and I didn't regret it!  I love that the whole bag is <200 calories, so I can feel like I'm really cheating, but it's actually not a terrible health choice!  I expected Fuji Apple to be my least favorite flavor because it's the plainest and I usually prefer granny smith's tartness, but this was actually my favorite!\n\nGranny Smith:  I tried to save this for a friend's birthday because we both love Granny Smith the best in my homemade chips or when eating regular apples, but it was sitting on the table, and I caved.  It's good!  It's much less sour than I expected, and less sour than my own dehydrated granny smith apple chips, but it's still sweet and tasty, just not very sour.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNature's Path Organic Chewy Granola Bars, Sunny Hemp Plus, 7.4 Ounce Box (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI had to double-check the expiration date: Yep, expires a year from now. Still, it smells and tastes like oil gone bad. There's soy. There's flax. There's something sweet. But it's all drowned out by the taste and smell of the bad oil. I opened two bars to be sure, and passed one to my coworker to smell. \"Yeah, gross,\" she said. \"I usually eat stale stuff, but I wouldn't eat that!\"\n\nAlthough I purchased this exact product locally, I did not buy it from this retailer.\n\nI'm surprised and disappointed - their pumpkin granola cereal is my favorite cereal!\n\nI much prefer Cascadian Farm's crunchy pumpkin granola bars, but they're hard to find.

WOW. They are crazy, crazy sweet and satisfied any candy craving I might have. They were so sweet that I was able to share my bag and nurse it through a day instead of gobbling it all down half-conscious of what I was eating. There was no subtlety, but I loved them. A++.\n\nThe mango OJ was also sweet, and tasty. It got stuck in my teeth every time: annoying, but not bad. I'd eat it again.\n\nThe bananas? Meh. Boring. They were the least sweet, the least flavorful, and the least interesting of the bunch. Some of the packages had a really yucky artificial taste to them, like a factory. It was bitter and unpleasant,and varied by package. I kept referring back to the packaging to see if there were unfamiliar ingredients (there weren't) or if it advertised being packed in a non-oxygen atmosphere that would have an off flavor to it. I tried airing them out, which didn't seem to help much.\n\nThe apples were ALL gross. Factory, factory, factory. Some of my coworkers shared my distaste, and some didn't seem to notice it at all, but every package was the same.\n\nIn the future, I'd order the pinepple guava, but no other flavor in this variety pack. Leave the factory IN the factory, please, and don't flavor my food with it!\n\nThe crunch was universally good for all of these products, by the by. It's very satisfying, but you can get it in any sufficiently dried food. All freeze-dried food and many bake-dried foods will have it.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nChoice Organic Twig Tea, 1.1 Ounces 16-Count Box (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI was introduced to kukicha when I purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Haiku-Japanese-Kukicha-Twig-100-Organic-16-Count-Tea-Bags-Pack-of-6/dp/B00121BQJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Haiku Japanese Kukicha Twig, 100% Organic, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, which was a tea experience unlike any I'd had before.

It's the best or second-best mint chocolate tea I have ever found in teabag form.  David's Tea in canada has a nice one, and there are some loose leaf cacao nibs with mint that are excellent, but for the availability and convenience, this wins.\nStrawberry Chocolate - my new favorite, even better than the mint.  Sweet and mild and delicious.\nCoconut Cocoa - I didn't try it, because I'm gluten intolerant and this one contains roasted barley.  My coworkers were unimpressed.  I'm surprised - I expected it to be quite good.\n\nThe packaging is lovely for trading, sharing, and gifting.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTrident Sugar Free Gum (Spearmint, 18-Piece, 12-Pack)\nReview:\nThese are a favorite of mine!

We not only feel better, but we are finding that we are looking better too.

It's a tradition that spans generations with time honored brewing techniques.  However, caffeine isn't the best friend of growing children - especially those who have been diagnosed as ADHD.  We've been using Luzianne's decaf tea for years in a 50/50 ratio with the regular Luzianne tea bags.  If you're at all familiar with the south you'll know that we tend to take iced tea rather seriously. When I was growing up my mother made iced tea from Lipton tea bags but when I discovered Luzianne tea there was no going back to Lipton!\n\nWe make our iced tea in this manner:\n\nSteep a quart to a quart and a half of water almost to boiling. You don't want to use boiling water as it will singe the tea and create a bitter flavor. As long as the heated water is steaming, it's hot enough. Add 1 family sized (or 2 regular sized bags) of each variety of Luzianne tea (caffeinated and decaffeinated) to the water and allow it to steep all day and come to room temperature. If you're making sweet tea, add a bunch of sugar (this is a personal preference measurement) to the bottom of a gallon sized pitcher, then add about 2 cups of the room temperature (or warm) tea and stir to dissolve all the sugar. At this point, fill the pitcher with ice. Pour the brewed tea on top of the ice and stir gently to combine. Add water as needed to fill your vessel. Your tea will be clear, sweet and refreshing with no bitterness or after-taste.

I just love peanuts!!  We had a family cookout this weekend and I passed them around for each of us to try and the the overall vote was fantastic.  A great product from a great company.  I think the fact that the peanuts weren't ground up to small pieces added to the richess of the product.  The peanut size in the bars was half a peanut and there are loads of them.  Planters didn't use a pea shooter to put the best of their product together.  Some products will stress a certain item only to have very little in there.  Not so here.

They aren't bad but I could not taste any of the cinnamon flavor they are supposed to have.  The seaweed itself is backed with a thin layer of dried brown rice to help hold it together better.  You cannot taste the brown rice and as for the seaweed it tastes like a strong spinach.  That's the closest comparison I could come up with to try and give you an idea of the flavoring.  You can eat 1/2 the package of these and there is only 80 calories to it.  Nice light snack that doesn't taste too bad and will take the edge off of your hunger pangs.

It's really a pain having thought you took the wrapper off only to find that there were two on it.  No problem here with this.  Nice tasting chocolate and the size is just right for an after dinner piece of candy to go with your coffee or tea.  Price is comparable with all the other candy bars out there so maybe you should just give these a try.  Remember Easter is coming and these would be great in the baskets.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBoost Compact Complete Nutritional Drink, Very Vanilla, 4 Fluid Ounce 4 Count(Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThese Boost drinks are half the size of the regular ones but with the same nutrition as the bigger ones.  I did like this and will continue to drink the pack I got even though I'm not a chocolate drink person but I the only thing I can say that sticks out a bit that I might mention is that it tastes a bit on the chalky side.  No overly so but enough to make you have to get used to it.  It does disappear after your finished quite quickly so that's a plus.  I personally love protein drinks for that little get up and go that it gives me especially when I need it.  To rate these against some of the others, I would say it's comparable or better.  Great size to stick in the purse too for an on the go Boost!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSide Mates Pearl Couscous, Tuscan Medley, 6 Ounce (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nThis has to be one of the easiest side dishes to make no doubt about it.  I do however cook mine a bit longer as I like it a bit softer.  The flavor on this one was okay but a bit on the bland side.  I added a bit of sauteed peppers, mushrooms and onion along with a bit of hot sauce and was feeling much better about the taste.  Would I buy this one again, probably not but I do like the rest of the line okay and would buy the other flavors.\n\nThis box makes a nice side dish that is fast and easy for three people as long as you have another side as well.  I would be able to make this and add a bit of meat and some other fav ingredients at the end and make a meal of it for myself also.  It is a bit on the starchy side so if you don't care for high starch or are on a starch free diet take this into consideration.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCelestial Seasonings Victorian Earl Grey Tea, 25 Count\nReview:\nIf you're out there looking for a tea that can rival coffee than this is for you.  I like my black tea strong and hearty and this is my favorite.  Just a wee bit stronger than Irish Breakfast IMO and with a great flavor.  I am a bit picky when it comes to teas and coffees but had to give this one an A+++ for every catagory.  You won't be disappointed.  Also, you can actually find this on most grocery store shelves compared to some other brands and the price is compariable to others.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBarilla Italian Entrees, Tomato &amp; Basil Whole Grain Penne, 9 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nAm I surprised, YUP!  I have had a few other brands of something on a similar theme and they just didn't cut it but this was really good.  The pasta could have been just a bit more cooked but the sauce was delicious and cried with flavor.  Portion size was great especially when you have a bit of bread and cheese with it.  Cooking instructions were right on and the dishes the sauce and pasta were in were just perfect.  Right amount of sauce for the pasta and it was the easiest meal I've had in some time especially one that I liked.  Would I buy this again, you bet.  I will make this a emergency staple for the house so that if I can't cook or am short on time it's here and quick.  Couldn't ask for more from a brand name I truly like.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['bit', 'like', 'flavor', 'really', 'great', 'one', 'make', 'would', 'good', 'get']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nGood Earth Green Tea, Jasmine, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis is good tea.

I then mixed well and poured it into a sterilized mason jar.\n\nI LOVE the smell of the Coconut manna, but then I love the smell of all coconut.  I normally use coconut oil in quite a few recipes and this is a slightly different experience as it includes the actual coconut.  The problem for me is that the ground whole coconut tastes and has the texture of....ground whole coconut.  Adding the coconut oil for creaminess isn't changing the gritty to smooth.  It changes the velvety texture of the oil to gritty, pasty (think really really thick peanut butter).\n\nThe only way I use it is making fresh peanut butter or almond butter in the VitaMix using just the nuts and a spoonful of Manna.  Said peanut butter on sandwich with banana or used in peanut butter cookies is borderline sinful.  This is the only thing I've found tastes good with this product.  I use coconut oil for everything else.\n\nI was adding it to various recipes but have found that the earthy/dirty (hard to describe) taste of the ground coconut just doesn't work with much.  In addition, it doesn't work well in smoothies in the vitamix as the manna never fully dissolves or incorporates in the drink.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSahale Snacks Cranberry Almond With Black Pepper &amp; Orange Zest Bar, No Artificial Flavors or Preservatives, 4 count\nReview:\nI have had hit and miss success trying sahale products, with my favorite being their snack blends.\nI love their creativity and inventiveness (which sometimes goes over into sheer weirdness).\nWe keep these type of bars around solely for emergency snacking and meal replacement (mostly in our cars) to keep us from snacking on even unhealthier items.\nThis variety pack was definitely filled with unusual flavor combinations. The bars are TINY, barely over an ounce (think snack candy bar size from hallowwen mixes for reference).\nThey average about 200 calories each, all have some type of nuts as first ingredient, have about 10 grams of sugars and 5 grams of protein.\nAll oh them were good, but none were great, and none will be reordered by either of us.\nOverall, we found them to be too chewy, gummy and sweet.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKember's Gluten Free Taco Seasoning, 4 oz.\nReview:\nWe eat a fair amount of taco seasoned meats in various menus so i was happy to see this gluten free blend\nIt arrived prompty and is packaged in a glass jar, excellent!\nThe flavor of the mix is excellent!\nThe price is way too high...it takes 1/4 cup mix per pound of meat, and the container appears to have about one cup of mix, maybe one and a quarter cup tops\nI would like to see this offered in a 16 ounce container at a much more attractiv price per ounce\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNurturMe Organic Quinoa Squares, Cheddar + Broccoli, 5 Pouches (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIn the good/better/best world of nutrition I think these snacks fall into the good category,\nIf your child won't eat whole foods and 'needs' their snacks delivered in mini-packages these are a good choice.\nEach package has about 8 smallish squares of snack, about 1/3 ounce of food.\nI am not a fan of mini packs of food because of the waste and receptiveness of package sizes.\nBut there are times where those little packages are handy.\nThe squares taste good, you can taste the cheese and broccoli which I like and there isn't any bitter/off taste that happens with a lot of self-labeled 'healthy' snacks. We all liked the texture of the squares as well.\nMy 2 year old grandson is a great and adventurous eater and likes real food so I wasn't surprised he liked these.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPamela's Products Gluten Free Whenever Bars, Cranberry Almond, 5 Count Box, 7.05-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThere are many other reviews that go into great detail regarding calories, ingredients etc.  I will not repeat that info here, but will limit my comments to taste/value/\"worth it\" factor.\nI thought these tasted just ok.  They would never be my first or second tier pick for a snack.  They are too small for meal substitute and contain too many calories for a snack for anyone watching weight.  I found the mouth feel of these to be unpleasant.  The taste is ok...none of the individual ingredients shine.\np.s. Someone with a chip on their shoulder has gone through the reviews for this product and given almost everyone of them an unhelpful feedback--and this includes a huge variety of detailed reviews.

I really do.\nI LOVE cocktails, but sometimes i just really want to get them in my hand and not squeeze, measure, and create. So, i periodically give new mixers a try.\nI have yet to find a mixer (other than some locally crafted bloody mary mixes) that tasted very good.\nThis one was so awful that I threw it out, with my lovely expensive bourbon I am sad to say. Bourbon with some form of ginger and a twist of lime is my go to, so it was a no-brainer picking this ginger lime flavored mixer.\nMy first impression was that I had just dumped four packets of sweet n low, which i abhor into my bourbon. I didn't taste ginger, and i barely tasted lime. I tasted nothing but sickly sweet (which i might have tolerated better if it was a cane sugar sweet) yuck.\nIn the spirit of fairness i poured a half shot of vodka into another glass and tried it with that. NO\nThen with club soda as on the box. NO\nI appreciate the creators attempts to make a So-called healthy mixer. But now i know that monkfruit, stevia, unnamed fruit and vegetable juices and unnamed natural flavors do NOT belong in a good cocktail.\nDumped it all out and recycled the glass.\nCreators, i am really sorry to give this bad review.

I want to be, I just have trouble with the tastelessness of water and thus fall into the trap of guzzling down sodas both for the caffeine and for the taste.  Which is a habit I'd really love to stop.  The problem with most drink additives though is the ingredients.  All those fake sugars and I figure I might as well be drinking a soda.  So then I saw True Lemon at the store and the advertisement that it was 100% natural.  So I thought why not try it?  And I'm glad I did.\n\nI started off with a little box of 10 packets of the Raspberry Lemonade to see how I would like it.  For drink additives it was pricey, but no more (and actually a little less) than if I had bought a case of the same amount of soda.  So I won't complain about the price especially considering this is better for me.  They came in little packets that were long and tubular shaped and easy to get open.  You just pop the top of your water bottle and pour the contents in, getting a little show in the meantime of the powder coming up like smoke from the bottle.  Hey, it doesn't take much to amuse me.\n\nThe taste is pretty good.  I think I taste more of the raspberry and sugar than they do the lemon, and that's why this product doesn't get more than four stars from me.  I would have liked to have had it be a bit more tart instead of just smooth and sweet.  But it's still not bad.  It goes down smooth and one packet is enough to flavor 17oz of water quite strongly.  It also turns the water a nice pale pink color.\n\nAs said before I was strongly attracted to this product because of its ingredients.  Instead of artificial sweeteners, stevia is used.  It also has lemon juice and other natural flavors.  Nothing in the ingredient list looked too bad so I'm happy.  And according to the box its only 5 calories, which isn't too bad either.\n\nDefinitely a product I'd try again, and I'll probably end up trying their other flavors as well.\n\nReview by M.

They used to sell these wonderful chocolate bars at my local Walgreen's but for some reason they stopped carrying them at all the stores in my area so I went to search for them on Amazon and here they were!  I was a little hesitant to purchase them at first because of the price but then I did price comparisons on the Internet and I figured that it was cheaper to buy them here than anywhere else, including many of those so-called \" candy \" stores that charge you and arm and a leg for the old classic candy bars you grew up loving.\n  Oh Henry! bars themselves taste unlike any other chocolate bar ont he market.  While not unlike a Snickers bar or a Baby Ruth bar in the way the peanuts crunch while you're chewing it in your mouth, the chocolate is better made, more mild and less sweet than a snickers bar and not as rich or as sweet as a Baby Ruth bar.  These bars are made by the famous Nestle company based out of Switzerland ( who also make baby Ruth ) bars and Nestle is a fine chocolate-maker, I'll give them that one for sure!  In fact, to me Oh Henry bars are not unlike a piece of candy you'd buy freshly made at a See's Candies store or something like that.  Fresh, aromatic, crunchy and just plain good.  I FEEL SO SORRY for the Amazon customer whose box of Oh Henry! bars came old and expired cos mine were fresh, chewy and just plain good.  I have already eaten 7 packages and I don't plan to eat anymore for a while but I know when I need to order another box ( which will be soon, you can bet on that ) Amazon.com is the place to go for them.  Also try Goo Goo Clusters Sumpreme if you like Oh Henry bars, they are a chocolate bar made by a candy company based out of Tennessee who produce a superior chocolate candy bar.  Well done Nestle, and thanks again Amazon!  UPDATE:  March 24th, 2011:  I HAVE ORDERED 3 MORE BOXES OF THESE AMAZING CHOCOLATE BARS SINCE THE TIME OF THE WRITING, THE MOST RECENT ON FEBRUARY 21st, 2011.

She claims they even help her to breathe better but that point is debatable. At one time she had me believing that cough drops were good for her overall breathing but I came to find out that what she really likes is hard candy in any form or shape. I conducted a brief experiment with her: I bought her a large bag of regular candy, like 20 lbs of variety type candy, and stopped giving her cough drops. Well, it seems that what she mostly wanted was hard candy in her mouth and she never once asked me for the cough drops while she had this sizable bag available. At her age and according to her doctor she should get away with almost anything so I did not sweat the situation. Her dental work is, of course, expensive for she is addicted to sugar in the form of hard candy. Getting back on track: while she was enjoying YummyEarth Organic Candy Drops, Wild Peppermint, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4) she praised them daily. I liked the amount on each bag and the many kind and encouraging reviews I found prior to purchasing this item. 4 Stars and when the faithful bag of candy disappears in time record I will give her the last two, which I am sure she will go back to endorsing the healthy properties of this cough drop, wild peppermint and all!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nYumEarth Organic Pomegranate Hard Candy, 3.3 Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nDecent candy but a little steep priced. 3.5 Stars\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Kodiak Cakes All Natural Frontier Pancake, Flapjack and Waffle Mix, Original, 24 Ounce (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nI am just dreaming because I haven't been camping since my Army days, but this would be the perfect start of the morning with a strong brewed coffee and powder milk for the kiddies. I was really pleased with my first batch of Flapjacks (I had never heard of that term, or if I did it did not stick), and was able to enjoy them thoroughly. Or should I say we, for I refuse to eat alone if I can help it. I normally make my own batter, an old family recipe that requires accurate measurements, plus a few ingredients, and more steps than one. When I am patient and careful, they are very good indeed, but as of last my so called pancakes have taken a turn toward the mediocre kind, and when I came across this great product called Kodiak Cakes Frontier Flapjack & Waffle Mix, 24-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), I was very intrigued to say the least. So I purchased after reading the knowledgeable and glowing reviews by the well respected amazon reviewers, I never had seen so many enthusiastic reviews for Flapjacks (I love that name), and after reading the nutrition box to see how many carbs they were all about, I was gladly surprised and encouraged by the findings.\nBoxes arrived, cabin like, outdoor like packaging, so much in fact, I was thinking of a mini camping trip on the backyard to add to the overall effect, perhaps myself cheating a little bit and going to my King Size where I reach deep levels of sleep without a hitch, but making sure to be the first one up to start the Flapjacks. I almost felt like hiding the boxes, and pretending it was all my skillful ways that made it happen. Enough to say is that I was able to put out an outstanding short/large stack of double fluffy (these did not flatten at all, even left overs remain inflated the next day) Flapjacks. Everyone agreed I had taken the concept to a higher level, and for a minute or two I took all the credit, when a sneaky little spy discovered the boxes. Add great syrup, Smuckers Sugar Free for the sugar intolerant, and regular Maple or your preference for the rest, quality butter (worry about heart attacks a little later), and eat them while they are hot!\nThe real beauty is that for regular Flapjacks all that is required is plain clean water from the streams, or the refrigerator in our case, and follow closely the sound advice found in the their website, kind of like the big no no's of making flapjacks, one of the most important: do not over steer the batter, do not overcooked, do not flatten (leave them be!), etc. I wanted to take the credit, but really, it belongs to Kodiak Cakes Frontier Flapjack & Waffle Mix! Will do the Waffle mix, but for now I am lazy and happy to use be using plain old water like in the old frontier! 4.5 Stars!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAl Dente Carba-Nada Egg Fettuccine, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nStill debating whether Dream Fields Pasta is better than Al Dente Carba-Nada Egg Fettuccine, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6).

Call me naive, call me a pasta lover, but I am firmly bought on the idea that this is a low carb pasta and prefer to not dispute the fact or second guess it. I love pasta, always have, always will! But since time does take a toll and careless living does have a consequence I ended being basically blocked from regular pasta. By basically I mean, that once I got a little smarter, I realized that most of my eating habits would have to change If I ever was to conquer my limitations. It was either or and going back to my many meals of italian origin, be that canneloni, lasaga, a la bolognesi, tutu di mare, pesto, I can go on and on and get hungry at the exact same time. The point is that Dreamfields Pasta (with such a beautiful name it can be the pasta of dreams) offers me a way out or should I rephrase and say: I way in. Man Oh Mama Mia, pasta a la alfredo, just with parmesan and butter (for me I can't believe it's not butter for the rest the real deal from the cow's mouth!) pasta primavera...I better stop! I am getting emotional and my eyes are heating up! With the upcoming Wonderfully Exciting FIFA World Cup 2010 and the beautiful first days of Summer Dreamfields Pasta appear like the saviors in a market that mostly ignore the needs, of perhaps the few, but never the less active, dedicated, and deserving as anyone else to enjoy life at its fullest! I hope this is the best of all world cups ever and I give 5 Stars to the only kid in town!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEZ-Sweetz (2.0oz - Liquid Sweetener 800 Servings/Bottle) (Original, 1 Pack)\nReview:\nBy weird I mean: here is a bottle that has this sugar replacement that cost a pretty penny and it measures in drops. Yes, two drops from this container equal one packet of splenda? And the container, supposedly, has 800 drops which is quite a statement that in true honesty I can not dispute because it would be really tedious to count every single little drop that pours out from the plastic dispenser. Okey, that aside let's go to the part in the title of my review where I also say: It works! I tried it in my regular daily coffee and must say the taste is very agreeable and I compare it mostly to Splenda (which has been the choice for the past year or more) and it certainly is as good, if not better. No weird taste that I been able to tell and with the added bonus that it has zero zero zero, I think it makes a strong case for consumption. Heard that Splenda does have carbs and calories compared with this EZ-Sweetz. So I like it and now I am trying to see how long will it last compared to the price it cost to buy it. And since it has no impact whatsoever in the glycemic index (don't I sound very informed?) that is a plus to be considered. Perhaps is not even expensive if it lasts for at least a month or more. I found the product by accident and intriguing from the gate go so I was running low on Splenda and instead of going back to Costco and purchasing another 1000 packets I bought this one. The only reason I gave it 4 Stars is for the value factor but in everything else that it is supposed to do, it does with shinning colors. Thankful to the fine, and I mean fine, reviewers in amazon which I have learned to value and trust their helpful opinions (most of the time, anywhoo) and who knew EZ-Sweetz (2oz - Liquid Sweetener 800 Servings/Bottle) existed in the free world? Not me, that's for sure and thanks to amazon and reviewers alike now I have one standing pretty in my kitchen ready for cereal, tea, coffee and why not? Maybe even for baking. 4 Stars but surely 5 if it last like 800 drops?\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['one', 'stars', 'like', 'good', 'little', 'taste', 'product', 'would', 'time', 'coffee']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nGood Earth Green Tea, Jasmine, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis is good tea.

The foil resealing bag actually seals airtight unlike other bags that do not seal well since they are cheaply made. I will definitely purchase other Azar products. Also this product is actually cheaper than buying non-toasted sliced almonds at my local grocery stores (Food Lion and Farm Fresh).

I really did not know what to expect for a nutty flavor, but was pleasantly surprised. I plan to use them as a nut substitute when I make banana bread. I was concerned since we were having such warm weather this past week that they would turn rancid during shipping, but they arrived fully sealed, fresh tasting, and thus far I have no shell complaint. I have also started using Nutiva's organic hemp oil for salad dressings and Pacific' hemp milk to decrease my use of diary. All products have proven enjoyable winners.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNext Organic Brazil Nuts Dark Chocolate Covered, 4-Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI ordered these from Amazon, but they are not listing it as a verified purchase which is odd. I only mention this as I tend to believe the verified purchases eliminate the \"shill factor.\" The nuts were delivered in perfect condition on a hot day. These candies are delicious and if you can resist not eating at least half of one package as a single serving, you have more self control than I! Organic dark chocolate covered Brazil nuts are difficult to find at a reasonable price. Now I wish I had purchased more while they were on sale. The nuts are fresh tasting medium sized covered in a glossy dark chocolate. This chocolate does not readily melt on your fingers, such as non-glossy chocolate typically does. I am enjoying these heavenly treats (5 pieces for 219 calories).\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNature's Path Organic Oats, Steel Cut, 30 Ounce Canister (Pack of 6) (Packaging may vary)\nReview:\nI'm a long time fan of McCann's oatmeal and a new fan of Country Choice (CC). The McCann's is cut larger so is a more chewier product. For those converting to steel cut oats, the finer cut of CC might make the transition easier. I could not tell a flavor difference between the two. Also for one serving I use one cup of boiling water w/ 1/3 cup of oatmeal. Here's my comparison based on Trader Joe's pricing:\nMcCann $4.99/28 oz., metal can, non-organic\nCountry Choice $2.99/30 oz., cardboard canister, organic\nSurprisingly the CC has 5G of protein vs. 4G for McCann and 4G of fiber vs. 3G for McCann based on  c. dry of each. Clearly CC is the best value, particularly since it is organic and made in the USA. BUT when Amazon has the coupon code deal, it's more of a coin toss and personal preference.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCountry Choice Organic Snacking Cookies, Iced Oatmeal, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIf these had not been organic I'd only given 2 stars. I'm used to eating Nature's Path organic ginger spice cookies which is the one I'm using to compare. The NP ones have a stronger ginger flavor which I prefer. The crunch factor (hardness) is about the same. The price point is the biggest factor. The NP at $32 w/o coupon for 12 9 ox. boxes are approx. 4.75 pound (the last case I bought had a coupon so were $22 or 3.26/lb). These are about 6.50/lb. at Amazon's current price. I probably won't buy these again as I'll stick w/ Nature's Path. That said, I did give this brand's chocolate mint cookies 5 stars and I do plan on purchasing those again as well as trying their chocolate chip and oatmeal cranberry.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nYS Organic Bee Farms - Organic Honey, 16 oz gel\nReview:\nThis is not your typical honey. Granted its organic and cream colored although it is not creamed honey. It is \"pure\" honey in the truest definition. The texture is solid, dense, somewhat waxy and velvety smooth with a pleasant floral taste. It describes itself as a gel, but I think it is much denser and although one gets a 1# jar, it is a small weighty jar. It softens easily on a piece of warm toast which is heavenly (no butter needed) or simply enjoy eating a spoonful by letting it melt in your mouth for a sensual treat. Due to its cost, which I think it is worth every cent, I won't be using it in tea. I'll continue using Rain Forest organic honey also sold on Amazon for that purpose. I think of this American/Canadian made honey as a true health food as it has numerous benefits. If you ever purchased the creamed South of France honey in the pail that Amazon used to carry, this honey's flavor and texture(when softened)will remind you of that incredible French honey. This is now my favorite honey. I encourage you to visit YS Organic Bee Farms website for additional information as they are a remarkable company. Also to comment on Swanson, the company that sold it, they were quick to fulfill and ship the order, both jars were well packed, they thanked me for my order a couple of times and sent a coupon for $5 off a future order which can be used in a direct order w/ them or on Amazon. So you know I'll be reordering this delightful honey and a few lucky friends may also receive a jar.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBack To Nature Jumbo Cashews, Sea Salt, Roasted, No Added Oils, 10-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI've liked most of the Back To Nature (BTN) products I tried and this is no exception. These are about 40% whole cashews and 60% halves. They taste fresh and are lightly sea salted. There are no added oils. I wouldn't call them jumbo though, as they are the same regular size of any other brand on the market I've tried. Since usually it is the Kirkland brand from Costco I buy, I will say BTN's taste much better, but they are also considerably more expensive. I will savor these 3 bags due to their high caloric content. Yum.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNewman's Own Organics Microwave Popcorn, Butter, 9.9-oz.

The pyramid shaped flaky crystals can be sprinkled on for light as air like salt crunch or broken between the fingers as it gets sprinkled on anything and everything. Grilled veggies never had it so good. Salted Caramel is beyond luscious with this added in. I use this in place of most salt in my cooking even tough I have about ten vials of various salts ranging from Grey Hawaiian Lava, Pink Himalayan, Bamboo Jade, Hawaiian Red Alaea to a Black course grind  ( great with lemonade) on my counter, I cook a lot so I go a bit nuts with this stuff. This is worth the buck and lasts a while, I say try it once then see how you feel about it, I use this as my daily basic cooking salt but it's really so much more as the taste and texture surpasses anything else salt related that I have ever bought.\n\nI also buy their peppercorns which are really zesty and the gorgeous pinkish smoked salt, this is so good that it best my usual stand by, Kosher salt which is nice and delicate but doesn't have the crunch and flavor of Maldon.

I don't know anyone who can resist the cozy boxes with cheery, charming artwork pleasing to the eye, all printed on 100% recycled cardboard, with the tea bags being large and very plain as their taste once dropped in the hot water is worth the bag looking the way it does while the cover art on the box really make this a better tea than some of the brand out there in their fancy boxes and shiny labels, that taste flat and bitter.\n\nMadagascar Vanilla Red is a caffeine free blend of Rooibos, Natural French Vanilla Flavor and Vanilla bean. When sugar or honey or even milk are added it tastes like the sweetest, almost chewy vanilla one can sink their teeth into whenever a sweet craving kicks in. I swear it reminds me of the Madagascar Vanilla I use in all my baking for the intense and heady sweet aroma and it tastes like a bakery treaty in a cup and since it's healthy, easy to find and inexpensive it makes me a very satisfied customer. If I drink it plain, no sugar no nothing it tastes like a delicate exotic tea with a breath of sweetness, and this is one of the very few teas I can drink plain, quite a feat in my eyes.\n\nI heartily recommend it for any tea fan, even if they don't think that Herbal/Caffeine type teas are their cup of tea, haha, this is better because its not decaf, its naturally caffeine free, omitting the artificial process and it simply makes me happy when I drink it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDoctor Kracker Organic Crispbread, Seeded Spelt, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nMy first introduction to Doctor Kracker was through a random review on Amazon about eight years ago, dormant but not forgotten the review resurfaced when I finally saw a box of the flatbreads at my local Zabar's (perk of living in New York). While shopping I spotted them so of course my curiosity escalated and I took a box home, I love pumpkin and cheese, so these were totally up my alley, a few years later and I'm a still huge fan, in fact I'm munching on the now, watching Japanese Iron Chef on TV now, figuring I should review something that I'm so wild for.\n\nThese offer a major crunch, you almost have to chew these like a Viking with gusto but they are oh so good, the cheddar is quietly baked into to the batter with a few extra sprinkles on top and it provides a lightly salty and crispy background for the nutty pumpkin seeds which are sprinkled throughout each large slab, you can barely taste the cheese, just the salty residue really as these are nice and healthy, each packs 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per 100 calories ( 8 per box). This is a great treat to enjoy with beer if you want to go hang out with friends, or a nice piece under some creamy French Bree or nice slice of cured meat, even turkey and apples can become a lunch time snack with this flatbread under as it's sturdy enough to be a part of a meal. For me these make for a yummy bite, I can never get enough and I finish a box in no time, these are subtle but so refined that they beckon for me to keep coming back, anytime I'm at that store I have to get these because it's impossible to resists what awaits inside. These do not taste like junk food, they are very basic yet complex, at first they hardly taste like anything but the more you eat them the more you want, so keep some on hand once you start them.\n\n- Kasia S.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Natural Oven Roasted Almonds Vanilla Bean, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI have passed these in the store a few times before deciding to give them a try, and man I'm glad I did. The taste is really etheral, nothing artificial or fake, but a mellow, smooth buttery hint of vanilla - pretty subtle but addictive never the less. The first day I had this I ate about  of the container and had to stop myself from having any more.\n\nThese comes in a nice size, 8 oz plastic container, easy to take with me or keep on my desk at work, true that is distracts me, I find myself gazing at them and reaching to have a piece here and there, but they taste as good as candy and are healthy.\n\nWhat I also love is the lack of corn syrup, this is sweet but has none of the appalling chemicals that food companies love to feed us with. This little nut, native to Iran is virtually carb free and has lots of fiber, vitamin E and is rich in mono unsaturated fat ( the good one that helps lower LDL cholesterol). It is possible that almonds benefit the skin - good complexion never hurts, and help prevent cancer, have anti-inflammatory properties and boosts immunity - phew, so much for such a little nut.\n\nAlso this price can't be beat, I will order my next batch from Amazon.\n\n- Kasia S.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAhmad Tea Peach &amp; Passion Fruit Black Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIf you're going to sip this lusciously delicious tea you might as well grab your kitty or puppy, a good book, blanket and snuggle up in the favorite armchair because good times are ahead!\n\nHaving the pleasure of all ready trying out some of the Ahmad teas I was pretty sure this was a good purchase but it ended up being tasty beyond my predictions. This tea tastes like a wonderful black smooth tea with the succulent mouth watering flavors of juicy apricots. I prefer a black tea with fruit blend to herbal fruit teas when I want something soothing because the black tea give the fruit unparallel depth and character.\n\nThis really bursts with flavor when sugar is added and it can be drank day and night. I'm really looking forward to tasting other Ahmad flavors like Strawberry and passion fruit and maybe their Earl Gray. This is easily one of my favorite teas and I can't see anyone not loving it from the first sip!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAhmad Tea Peach &amp; Passion Fruit Black Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI'm a tea lover and as much as I like super fancy blends, sometimes plain black tea is the most  soothing and simply satisfying.  This tea is a simple and delicious treat with some smooth creamy vanilla and if anything its even more comforting and luxurious than any of my favorite black teas. The taste is so natural and subtly sweet that it feels extra special and can really be drank at any time of the day instead of plain tea.\n\nIm really looking forwards to trying all of the flavors Ahmad carries, and at these great prices I see no obstacles on my tea tasting journey!\n\nEach bag is packaged beautifully in foil and the box can stand straight up, facing forward with this removable slit at the bottom for easy dispensing.\n\nLovely and tasty, simply great tea.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nArrowhead Mills Organic Spelt Flour, 2 Pound (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI often use this organic flour to make warm and cozy muffins in the fall and winter seasons, my favorite are the Apple and Cinnamon Muffins from the Nigella Kitchen cookbook by my culinary muse Nigella Lawson.  Those are just divine and oh so easy, this wonderful organic flour lets me have fun in the kitchen because I can bake and try out new stuff and still make it healthy since the fiber in this product is impressive. Just  cup has 130 calories, 1 gram fat, 0 saturated, trans fat, cholesterol & sodium, 150 mg potassium, 25 g carb, 4 grams fiber, 0 sugar and 4 grams of protein with some niacin and riboflavin per serving.\n\nSpelt is special and it's related to wheat; the earliest findings of it are from the 5th millennium BC, just north of the Black Sea in Transcaucasia. Europe munched on it for ages, I come from Europe but it was America that introduced me to it through British recipes, life is funny indeed! This grain has been traced from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age, it kept the human machine alive and growing so I figure it won't hurt to bake with it once in a while, turns out that the nutty taste and hearty bite aren't so hard to convert to, this can make delicious  breads, cookies or muffins, white flour isn't the only option anymore, the world of good grains lies in front of everyone, just takes a change and courage to cook with the ancient grains that have stood the test of time, the taste and health benefits are worth the try.  Spelt does contain gluten, which I don't have a problem digesting, just a fyi to bakers out there who have food sensitivities and allergies.\n\n- Kasia S.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRiceSelect Organic Jasmati Rice, 32 oz Jars (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nCurrently I'm on my second jar of this fantastic rice, it completely seduced me with its nutty and totally buttery aroma - raw in the jar it smells just like that, but the taste is equally impressive.\nMy favorite way of making it starts with saut&eacute;ing two shallots or some onion with a bit of olive oil or butter, then to that I add whatever herbs I have around, usually rosemary or thyme, then I add the uncooked rice and dry saut&eacute; it until lightly toasted, at the end I throw in a handful of golden raisins and two cups of chicken broth, 20 minutes on a slow simmer and a tasty side is ready.\n\nI have burned my share of rice in the past or was forced to throw out the overly wet batches, but this one comes out perfect every time.

Sometimes you want something soft and soothing but not herbal, that almost tastes like juicy water and this really takes the punch.\n\nI love it with a bit of sugar, and it gets even better when cooled or made with ice. For those watching calories, sugar can be omitted and this tea can be drunk in gallons to refresh and tranquilize. I can forget all about store bought iced teas and all the soda in the world when presented with this, as it is truly a tea I can see myself buying for the rest of my life. It's gentler than black tea, healthier and 100% natural with less caffeine than coffee and that flowery aroma of summer bouquets caught in a tiny tea bag is a marvel to behold.\n\n- Kasia S.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRed Espresso Ground Rooibos Tea, 8.8-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nThis is an interesting brew, but I have to admit it tastes a bit different and has that \"health\" drink tang to it, I love black tea and good coffee so this is something I would drink to have instead of those two but never as a substitute.

Its actually a variety of millet thats easy to grow in diverse climates and under unpromising conditions and has a sweet, molasses-like taste. Its also gluten-free. You need to read Nutrition Facts on this grain to see the shocking amount of minerals and vitamins that it contains. Rare grain but healthy and delicious. Takes long time to cook so I mix it with many other grains like amaranth and barley which take long time to cook as well and the result is one fulfilling, nutritious mix that I add to all my soups. It is a different grain but a rare grain and I consume with all oher grains. Teff is never organic, produced in US, gluten free with calcium and magnesium, Teff is kissing cousin of Amaranth. Both have almost the same composition, mostly the same minerals and vitamins except Teff is high in manganese. I stopped consuming oats since I could never find oats having any Phytosterols and hardly any other minerals, so amaranth offer more nutrients, especially when it is raw and uncooked. If I was baking bread, Amaranth bread would offer more starch 111-71=40gr which translates into more calories but for cardio, it is well needed. Starch makes you feel full just like rice, potato, pasta unlike greens where you can eat and eat and still feel hungry but with starch it is like eating protein. The 50% extra starch difference is what pushes Amaranth to sell more than Teff. Teff vs. Amaranth in calories 708/716, calcium DV% 35/31, magnesium DV% 89/120, potassium DV% 24/28, zinc DV% 47/37... Teff is never USDA organic certified. Amaranth offers more selenium 52-12=40% and vitamin B5 28-18=10% which are essential nutrients.

Quinoa cooks in ten minutes, no more no less, ready on the spot, whenever I wish, with no hassle, with great taste but Amaranth and Teff take longer, and I mean really, really longer.

Produced naturally by the body in small amounts, melatonin plays a role in inducing sleepiness at night and wakefulness during the day. Although melatonin is marketed as a supplement to help people fall asleep, I'm not a big advocate of going that rout since I care less for unregulated supplement industry. Consuming natural melatonin from whole foods like cherries is clearly another story since it is a fruit and my body more likely is going to use that very natural ingredient from a fruit in a much different way than it would via a pill. I do the same with ACV since I have no intention to go to store every single day. I am very healthy with no chronic or health issues and for years I have consumed cherries for inflammation since being in many sports, my body appreciates any help that it can get for all those bends and twists that it requires my joints to keep up those grueling exercises at a time. I just consume a spoon every single night straight out of the bottle, no mixing, no stories. Conventional cherries are one of the dirty dozens so USDA organic option is better choice for me. Furthermore the added sugar and oil, make this a very high calorie food with thirty one grams of sugar for one third cup serving size.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBumble Bee Salmon Pink Canned, 14.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThe cannery which produces this pink salmon for Chicken of the Sea, produces for majority of the sellers selling pink salmon. All come from one area in Alaska. It is the same can with different wrapping and sold for twice the cost in supermarkets but at Whole Foods Stores for $3.29 and Trader Joes for $2.99 year round except three months out of the year. Will never taste the same as the sockeye salmon fresh out of water, not few weeks old that I BBQ with the skin and eat the whole thing with just pitta bread, nothing added just pure salmon skin, meat and juicy oils. That is one real tasty delicious food out of this world. These are not as tasty but it is the best alternative and a very good alternative since ready whenever I want it to, in a can. Forget about the farm raised junk fish where they add carpet die. For something like $3.50 a pound, this is a very healthy protein source for me with many nutrients especially after pumping iron. Costco sells the worst tasting canned pink salmon, these are much better than Costco. Pink salmon is sold in cans hardly ever or infact never fresh unless you catch it yourself in Alaska. These are all small salmons so you will get couple of whole salmons in a can with all the bones and the skin. Product feature description is wrong. You can not take out the skin and the bone that easily so you may forget about buying this salmon if you can not consume it all. There is no vitamin A in this salmon either like some claims out there. I consume a lot of wild fish, sprats, sardines, herrings... No farm raised fish for me or fresh fish unless I catch it myself since fresh fish means few weeks old except shell fish which I get it in three days. The smaller the fish the more nutrition in the fish. I consume these salmon since these salmon stay in the rivers of cold Pacific in order not to be consumed by the bigger fish and feast on small bugs and fish which are high in nutrients. Few of the reviews on Amazon about these salmons consuming squid is misrepresentation. Bones means calcium. Skin means good polyunsaturated fat. I mix the whole can with few different vegetables and wolla, get my calcium, protein and all nutrients for $3.50 a pound. These pink canned salmons are in water not vegetable oil. I drain the water since I could care less for 2000 mg of salt in the can. Healthy, without any additives, growth hormones, pesticides, antibiotics, carpet dye, or sitting on a shelf exposed to air for few weeks... Sockeye salmon is the only fresh wild salmon you can get during the spring run and sold as smoked salmon which I consume but cost more. Atlantic and steelheads are only farm raised. Keta, Pink, Chum, Coho are always canned. Bravo.\n\nWARNING: 99% of all cans are lined in plastic which leach high levels of a chemical called Bisphenol A, which has been linked to cancer, clogging of arteries, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA for more information. This product claims that it has no BPA. It is generally safer to eat fresh than it is to eat canned goods. Canned goods, sometimes are contaminated with harmful agents such as botulism.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nAhmad Tea Aromatic Earl Grey, 17.6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI consume few cups of tea on daily basis somewhere around 10 plus cups a day and I have been doing that for last few decades. I try all different brands all the time. I have bought this tea for $10 a can and that is from a busy tea shop that sells boxes after boxes. I use percolator and mix this tea with green tea and end up with an excellent tasting tea, cup after cup. This tea in no way is a full body Earl Grey tea. Ahmad Tea does not specify what kind of black tea. I would assume this is the same as less pricier English Breakfast Tea with added Bergamot flavouring. The real Earl Grey is sold in the green container which is pricier. After using this for one month, I stopped since for unknown reason this tea stained my teeth when infact I have not experienced such heavy staining with any other tea.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill French Green Lentils, 24-ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nFrench green lentils are not too popular and certainly expensive. I consumed this before I was able to get organic in bulk for $2.90 a pound. Takes longer to cook so better for soups. The taste is closer to green but for more money and available in organic form as well. Just because of the taste and the price, Bob will not sell it in four quantity bags like they do with red and green. Yellow is the most expensive, never in organic form, green and red always available in organic form. Red sells for 50% more than green. Green has more potassium than red and better for soups. This is conventional, not a GMO but certainly not organic. Excellent brand but organic is always better for the planet earth and its inhabitants if organic available. I consume red, yellow and last green lentils all the time. Red cooks fastest of all, tastes the best the same for yellows but yellows are rare. Green is firmer but not as tasty as red. Sometimes I consume lentils without adding anything to it but sometimes I do which tastes great. I do not soak lentils overnight just like I do with any type of bean since too much soaking will damage lentils but regardless soaking is a necessity since it allows heat faster without killing more nutrients. Lentils are soft unlike beans so just couple hours of soaking is good enough. Lentils need to be washed and rinsed few times since the dirt on the lentils causes foam regardless of the brand, organic or conventional, so rinse, rinse, rinse. I saut lots of fresh squash in EVOO with lots of spices, steam lentils in a separate pot, mix it together and place it all in a bowl where I add lots of fresh crushed bulbs of delicious CA garlic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/2-x-2-Pound-Fresh-Garlic-USA-California-Heirloom-Monviso-Gilroy-Finest-4-Pounds-Total/dp/B00E382P44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">2 x 2 Pound Fresh Garlic USA California Heirloom Monviso Gilroy Finest (4 Pounds Total)</a>&nbsp;which are real spicy and burns my tongue with lots of Sumac and my favorite sardines not sold at Amazon.

At $1.14 a pound it is one of the top daily ingredients of my diet. Difficult to find peanuts in shell, UNSALTED without any oil. Peanuts are very high in fatty acids where many other nuts lack and the price of peanuts are as great as their taste. No peanut butter for me since I consume the nut itself as medicine, a needed ingredient on a daily basis which is a priority to me for getting the fatty acids of ARACHIDONIC which converts LINOLENIC, MEAD for cartilage and ARACHIDIC an unsaturated fatty acid essential to the human body for healthy brain functioning and normal growth and development. I consume pistachios on daily basis as well for PALMITOLEIC fatty acid which increases insulin and almonds for PHYTOSTEROLS, VITAMIN E, CALCIUM and MAGNESIUM. I do extensive fatty acids blood tests which are expensive but it insures my healthy life style and peanuts are so important part of the equation. I could care less for sodium and processed peanuts since I have no assurance of what I get in processed peanuts regardless of powder, oil or butter at high prices and more importantly where nuts go rancid much quicker than when kept in a shell form. No sodium, without any oil is the way to go since roasted without shell are digested quicker which in return turn into unwanted calories where not roasted takes longer to digest which makes one stays full for a longer period of time. I bought PB2 at Costco and tried contacting the producer but they will not provide a table of their fatty acids or amino acids. In one word, this is a pure processed food with no table of what is in the mix. Even whey isolate powders provide a table of all their content when it comes to each acid but PB2 does not. It certainly provides the fact that ingredients are SUGAR and SALT with UNKNOWN fatty acid ratio of peanut proteins... What peanut proteins...\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Red Lentils Beans, 27-ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nRed Lentils are different.

Ground lentils mixed with oil and water become skin cleanser, but without oil it becomes mud and sticks.\n\nRed Mill is a good brand but regardless it is a business for profit. Red lentils have the lesser nutritional values of all lentils but what is disturbing is that red lentils have some 60% less dietary fiber than the rest of the lentils. I do not intend to stop consuming red lentils because of the misleading fiber amount printed on Red Mill's labelling where Red Mill claims that their French, Red and Brown all have the same fiber since I love red lentils but Red mill is certainly misleading consumers. You can check the facts with USDA Nutrition Facts which is the only trusted source available on the Internet and you can see the difference of nutrients. This is conventional not in organic form either.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Corn Flour, 24 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nCorn is an excellent grain and I do not care going to the store and purchasing it frozen so I try to get organic in dry form and this was the best product but unfortunately goes rancid quickly since it is in ground form. I was looking for corn nothing more nothing less, Bob sells their corn flour which is pure corn, no additive, no mix as follows; Conventional $9.59, organic $11.79, (( par of the germ removed soaked in lemon called Masa Harina $11.79, gluten free Masa Harina $13.99)), gluten free conventional $18.90 all of those in 4 packages of 24oz. Can not figure why Bob sells Masa Hernia for less although some of the germ is removed since that is lots of work soaking it in lemon. Amazon sells it for different prices. I do not bake or make tortillas or bake cookies, I just dump some in my food so I would have the taste and benefit of corn. Bob is an excellent brand even when it comes to conventional since Bob is never GMO, no pesticide, no chemicals...\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli Cereal, 40-ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI purchased this for a friend of mine since there is hardly any healthy cereals out there.

She mixes Muesli with organic soy milk few hours in advance and consumes it in the morning. With fiber, protein, minerals and vitamins mixed with hemp seed that I purchase for her, nothing can come close to this healthy food. No one sells it out there for less than Amazon.

It's overly expensive, weak quality, and wasteful. So whether you use a \"My K Cup\" adapter, or this Solofill (or some other brand) that enables you to use your own coffee, that's a choice you really need to make.\n\nI had used a \"My K Cup\" for a long time. But the mesh was finally wearing through and so I wanted to give something new a try.\n\nThe advantage for the Solofill:\n\nMUCH less spraying and extra water into the cup, which means overall better tasting coffee and less mess. This is because you will use the original K-Cup pod in the Keurig (unlike the \"My K Cup\" which is a seperate adapter). So it's designed to fit like a K-Cup, and it doesn't have the problems with the spraying.\n\nThis is a BIG plus.\n\nThe disadvantages, which to be fair are mostly annoyances, but still...\n\nA pain to clean. Unlike the \"My K Cup,\" which had multiple parts and was easy to flick the old grounds out of, this requires you have to dig into the grounds to get them out. Then, the little divot at the bottom needs some extra spray to come clean.\n\nThe lid does not have a lip to open it, so you have to be careful it doesn't open and spill grounds everywhere.\n\nOverall, it's okay - but I'm all about convenience, and the aggravations push it to three stars instead of four...but someone else might see it differently.\n\nI don't see any significant difference in coffee taste. I drink coffee black, and it tastes about the same to me. It SHOULD be a little stronger without the extra water, but I don't notice.\n\nIn fact - another reviewer noticed that the water might go through TOO quickly, which makes it water. I'm not sure - but it's possible.\n\nUPDATE, Feb. 27, 2013: I hiked the rating to four stars from three. I've been using it for awhile, and I like it - I still don't like the cleaning, but overall I'm having no problems with spillover and I think it distributes the water through the coffee grounds more effectively.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It has a mild flavor so I can use it for just about anything I make.  The quality has been consistent over the years.  The size of the can is small enough and I use enough of it (Mediterranean diet!) that I don't find it requires decanting as the can empties.  I have learned how to handle the spout without any problems.  It is easy to keep the container clean.  The can is cheerful with its bright colors.  The price is reasonable, especially since Amazon has it in its subscribe and save program--although the discount is less now for buyers than it was when I first started buying it from Amazon.

The flavor is accurate.  One or two leaves is all that is needed in a broth.  Amazon packs these in threes so I think I have a supply that will last several years.  The price is reasonable.  Having these on the shelf makes it easier for me to cook up a great Thai soup of stew whenever I am in the mood.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMestemacher, Pumpernickel with Whole Kernels, 17.6 oz\nReview:\nGreat Westphalian pumpernickel straight from Germany.  It stays fresh when wrapped for quite a few weeks.  The pieces are large:  a half is enough for one sitting with soup or a salad.  The taste is rich and crunchy since it is full of grain kernals.  Great with cream cheese or as an accompaniment for good cheese, fruits and vegetables as an appetizer.  A nice break from traditional yeast breads or crackers.  Not very useful for making sandwiches as it tends to crumble.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nViva Naturals Organic Coconut Flour: Non-GMO, and Gluten-Free, 4 lb Bag\nReview:\nThis is the first time I have used coconut flour when baking and I am very pleased with it when I mix it with other grains in cooking.  It gives a distinct slightly sweet coconut flavor to baked goods.  I have not used it by itself, preferring to combine grains for a more complex flavor and for better nutrition.  With this company I know that I am getting organic, non GMO flour which matters to me.  It is also great for cooking for those who avoid glutens.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGreat River Organic Milling, Oatmeal, Thick Rolled Oats, Organic, 50-Pounds (Pack of 1)\nReview:\nThis is a very high quality extra thick rolled oat.

My husband practically lives on granola and seems especially happy with these rolled oats.  The price is reasonable, especially with Subscribe and Save.

I am glad to keep this in stock in my kitchen, especially since it is gluten free.\n\nSince first reviewing this product I've seen more press on this amazing grain.  It is being touted as a superfood and rightly so.  I recommend keeping opened bags of quinoa in the refrigerator.  I had learned the grain contains oils, thus you want to be sure to keep the product chilled to be sure it doesn't become spoiled.  Enjoy this delicious and healthy grain in soups, salads, under chicken or seafood.  There are so many great uses to incorporate quinoa into a balanced diet.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Just use the pepper to add serious heat and flavor and then toss it. A friend of mine was visiting his father in South Carolina and found this same brand of dried Scorpion Peppers in a hot sauce store down there. He bought them for me because he knows I like the heat. I'm almost 50 now so my days of doing stupid stuff with hot sauce and peppers is over, but I can still handle a nice batch of inferno with a side of the runs now and then. I made a big batch of green chile stew with some leftover pulled pork I made and about 18 good sized roasted hatch peppers last Sunday. I decided to add one of these dried Scorpion Peppers to the stew for about 2 hours, at which point I fished out the pepper and tossed it in the garbage. I'l just say that it's a good thing we didn't have company for dinner. My wife can handle it but most people cannot. It was hot and it's the kind of hot that hits you immediately. No creeper with this one.....BAM!!!!! I personally love that and not many peppers can do that, they usually creep up on you. I cannot wait to try one of these in a wing sauce. I usually use Franks Red Hot, clarified butter, Dave's Original Insanity and a touch of honey or brown sugar for my wing sauce. I think I can omit the Daves Insanity next time and try one of these peppers. I'll probably reconstitute it in room temperature Franks for the entire day and then heat all the ingredients on the stovetop for a while. That should produce a wing with a good thwack of heat upon first biting in. You could also reconstitute these in olive oil to drizzle over potatoes or other veggies.\n\nI wouldn't suggest playing any jokes on anyone with these. That's not funny and you would really ruin someones day if they ate one of these.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTrinidad Moruga Scorpion Hot Sauce (5 ounce)\nReview:\nThis sauce has a nice flavor to it. At first it came across as being a bit salty but that was tasting it off a spoon. The only salt in the ingredients list is garlic salt and that's towards the bottom of the list. I'm not a total heat freak so this is about as hot as I can handle. It makes my head sweat and if I use too much of it my stomach is in bad shape as it cries out for me to stop. If you like this one try the Melinda's Naga Jolokia as well.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTrinidad Moruga Scorpion Hot Sauce (5 ounce)\nReview:\nThis is a flavorful hot sauce that has a good kick to it.  If you can handle a good amount of heat and flavor is a top priority then this is the sauce for you. It's not a concentrated sauce and doesn't use extract so it's not going to drop you to your knee's the way some of the reviewers would like.

This isn't a hot sauce that I would use for Buffalo Wings or home fries. This stuff lends itself to tacos, nachos, burritos etc so well that it's hard to describe. I'm a hot sauce fanatic and I love habenero hot sauces, but habenero hot sauce just doesn't work on a taco like this stuff does. I always thought it did, and it is very yummy, but not like this stuff on Tex mex or Mexican chow. I live in Upstate New York and travel a lot for business. I buy this stuff on the west coast for $1.29 a bottle at the grocery store, bubble wrap it and bring it home in my luggage. I think about this hot sauce some times. It's amazing. To put it in perspective for you west coasters, I hate Tapatio. It's got too much vinegar. This stuff does not. I would like to thank the creator of this hot suace, because it's that good.

You have to remember that this is good chocolate and that you may need to force your receptors to forget the taste of Hershey's Special Dark. This particular Lindt is the real deal.\n\nWe had some friends over for dinner last night and they somehow noticed one of these bars. When I told them what it was their reaction was priceless.

You can taste the almonds but it is a pretty bland taste.  You would need to add something if you wanted to get a stronger taste.  I am not saying this is bad, just be warned, you are going to get this explosion of flavor from this product.\n\nThe butter needs to be stirred if you want it to be smooth.  Once again, a spoon and a few moments and you have smooth almond butter.  It is a little on the dry side but once again, it is still a very good product.  Once it is stirred you can pretty much put it on anything.  It doesn't clump much and you don't really have to worry about ripping bread.  It should smooth over without any issues.\n\nMy only issue is the price point, you would do better buying the big jar, getting small Tupperware pieces and putting the almond butter in them.  It is a great product, that being said, getting a jar and separating it if you are on a budget makes more sense.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWildway Banana Nut Gluten-free, Paleo, Grain Free Granola, 6 Pack\nReview:\nAs many others have stated this is more of a chewy granola than a crunchy one.

There are nine grams of carbs of which five grams per serving are sugar.  You get four servings per container and the whole thing has 600 calories total.  This is a pretty decent snack.

The sweet-sour flavor of the paste adds the \"just right\" touch to pad thai, curries, chutneys, salad dressings, etc.  It's the perfect complement to other ingredients such as fresh chiles, aromatics such as garlic, ginger, and shallots, coconut milk, or a blend of some or all of the above. A bit of sugar in a recipe really helps to accent the flavor. Besides adding flavor, tamarind works great as a marinade. The fruit's natural acidity helps to tenderize tougher cuts of beef, breaking down the fibers in the meat. Marinated overnight in a tamarind-infused liquid, beef becomes succulent and tender. Be careful with fish or chicken: if left in the marinade too long, the tamarind marinade alone will begin to \"cook\" it. Tamarind's rich color also deepens the color of a marinade, which can make a wonderful sauce when reduced.\n\nWith the 6 jars of paste that came in this order, I'll have to get cracking at finding and/or thinking up recipes that I can use it in, especially since you only use a small amount each time.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

They also have a pronounced oily smell and flavour (40% of the calories are from fat and oil is the third ingredient). They have very little protein, but are fairly low in calories compared to \"traditional\" chips. I couldn't taste lentils (they are the first ingredient, but potato is second) and overall they are very bland; there is virtually no seasoning on them. The seasoning they did have, however, was really good. I only ate a few; they just weren't what I was looking for.\nPhotos show teeny bit of seasoning.

There is a good amount of rasins in the cookies, but they do not overwhelm at all the chocolate but compliment it.\n\nI know Erin also sells just a chocolate cookie.

There is no hint of sweet, is a savory experience. At first the unsweet intense taste was not the most pleasing. But as I finished the first bar and then had more in the coming days and weeks I started to very much enjoy the rich, savory, full chocolate taste.\n\nIt will take some getting use to though.

I searched the various chocolates and this came out best in that it doesn't use soy and also isn't processed in a way to reduce antioxidants. In fact it became one of the few choices on Amazon to meet those criteria and have a high cocoa percentage.\n\nGranted soy lecithin in small amounts is probably OK. But you don't have to worry about it with this bar and very satisfying taste. And 2.5 squares is a large serving, all my family usually has less than one square and it satisfies. Highly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBear Valley Pemmican Bars, Carob Cocoa, 3.75-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI bought these to be used essentially as breakfast. First off I find these delicious. They have almonds, raisins, sunflower seeds, and just enough of a cocoa taste. They are very dense and you will want to have a lot of water or other liquid available. They are also amazingly filling. Yes 440 calories (2 servings/ one par) so more of a meal replacement than a snack. But for breakfast a whole par gives you 16 grams of protein. Protein really helps get the mind/body going in the morning so they are excellent for that.\n\nBut you are also getting 24 grams of sugar. A little high. But at least it isn't from corn syrup or even sugar as a separate ingredient. I do highly recommend these for meal replacement, especially breakfast. I have them 3 times a week for breakfast and feel really good and satisfied until lunch. This is usually 4.5 hours away for me. I think they would be excellent for backpacking and camping as well. Or other meals in the day. Tasty and satisfying, with good ingredients.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nThe Good Bean Chickpea Snacks, Cracked Pepper, Gluten and Nut Free, 2.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis is a great idea, chickpea snack. It is also executed well. While a little on the dry side, these are a hearty but not heavy snack that have a very robust peppery taste. Af first I thought they were a tad bit on the expensive side which is my only down side in addition to you REALLY need to like a pepper taste. However, especially with subscribe and save, you get a good amount of snacking for the price. Especially for something that is better for you than most snacks and filling.\n\nBut I still think many people who are just ok with pepper might find the taste too intensely peppery. But overall for a hearty, healthy snack I do recommend these. And if pepper is not your thing you might want to consider a different flavor.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCampbell's New England Clam Chowder Soup on the Go, 10.75 Ounce Microwavable Cups (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nWow. I was not expecting this to taste as good as it does. This is a wonderfully flavorful soup. You get real clam taste and a good texture (little on the thin side but acceptable), and even a bit of creaminess. It is actually the best tasting store bought clam chowder from a national brand I have ever tried. I have tried various types of Campbells before and Progresso, and probably some regional brands I can't remember.\n\nBut this is a very good soup. The first few ingridients in order are water, clam stock, potatoes, celery, clams, vegetable oil. Unfortunately Campell's does use high fructose corn syrup, but it is at least fairly far down the ingridient list. Too bad to save a few pennies or less (maybe even a fraction of a cent over real sugar?) probably per can of production they choose that. It does contain monosodium glutamate in case that is a no go for some people.\n\nOverall though this is great to have in your pantry. You get a good amount of fill for 150 calories but you are also getting 15% of DRA for Total Fat 10 grams, and 10% of saturated fat, 2 grams. Zero trans fat is listed. It is good enough to have for lunch a couple of times a week. Pair this with some fruit, and maybe some cheese and you will have a good enjoyable work lunch. Nice to have on hand for rainy days also.\n\nIt takes 1 minute 15 seconds on high. It is a narrow can but you do have the option of putting the 'sip cap' back on and drinking your soup. The advantage of that is that the can helps keep the soup warm all the way through. Enough good about this product starting with taste, that I do recommend it.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPirate's Booty Snack Puffs, Aged White Cheddar, 4 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis is one of the better snacks I have tried on Amazon.

I just finished the tea yesterday but have some few packets of colon cleanse left to finish. In case you don't know the colon cleanse tea is only consumed every other day so it will outlast the Skinny tea during the 30 day treatment. I lost 5 pounds by the 3rd week but I haven't weighed myself since then. I know I've lost more than that due to how my clothes fit especially in my hip and thigh area. I was already fit prior but this really blasted the stubborn inches. As a rule, I don't believe that scales tell the true story more than pictures, mirrors and how clothes fit.\n\nBy the way, I must stress that I'm a 4-5  day  gym rat who also Crossfits but I do think tea is SUPER effective. Especially with bloating and removing toxins which is the culprit that causes the body to hold onto excess weight.\n\nPROS:\n-Both teas taste amazing (Very high quality leaves and herbal blends)\n-The aroma of both teas are great. Makes you feel so soothed as you consume them\n-The Skinny tea helps with appetite suppression. I didn't get any excess energy from it like other people\n-The directions are easy to follow and thus makes completing the detox effortless\n-It REALLY gets rid of any toxins or build up in the digestive tract (You will become insanely regular)\n\nCONS\n-The colon cleanse does cause some cramping. This is especially true during the first 2 weeks when it's seems like your body is getting adjusted to the detoxing ingredients. I have had the cramping reduce significantly now. The only time I will feel a cramp is if I don't go to the restroom when I get the urge. I know, TMI but I really want to state that may be the main cause of the cramping at times. You HAVE to go when you get the signal from your body. If you try to wait the cramps will increase in severity.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBewley's Dublin Morning Tea, 250 gram/8.8 ounce,80-Count\nReview:\nI bought this brand along with another brand of British tea. I love the aroma and taste of this stuff allot. I rotate between this and the more traditional British one I have. I think anyone who is a connoisseur of fine teas should add this to their collection. It's simply lovely.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDechunxian Yunnan Pu-erh Pu Erh Black Tea Diet Tea,100% Natural Organic Tea Leaves,produced From High Mountain Ancient Tree (Yunnan Puerh Ripe Tea)\nReview:\nThis tea is really good. Its not bitter but it doesnt have any natural hints of sweetness either. I find it best with no additions with the exception of stevia or honey.\n\nOVERVIEW: First of all it comes in a cute reusable canister that contains the bag of the tea leaves. A little goes a long way with this brand and I typically measure out less than half a teaspoon to brew a cup. Some people say you will need a tea strainer/infuser, however, Ive found that it can be prepared without one. Since you have to let this steep for 5-8 minutes to reach its dark composition, the leaves naturally sink to the bottom of your cup. Ive stopped using my infuser and prepare it in this way.\n\nCONS: There's nothing written in English on the canister. Thought I would just point that out for fellow shoppers. However, I've purchased many products that this was common so it's not a deal breaker for me. The most important thing  is that they do put the expiration date in English on the bottom of the container. My batch is slated as October 3, 2016.\n\nAdditionally, a friend told me not to throw away the previous leaves and to reuse them for my next cup since Asian teas are really potent. Ive gotten 3-4 cups of dark, rich tea from this process. So even though the amount of tea doesnt initially seem like allot, you must keep this in mind. This is not your average tea from a grocery store. By using these traditional practices of small measuring and reusing of the leaves, you will get the full health benefits and cups per canister. Since I often like to refer to myself as a coffee and tea connoisseur and I definitely give this beverage my approval.\n\n*I received this product for free in exchange for my review.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCopper Moon Single Cups for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Kenyan, 20 Count, Medium Roast Coffee, Bold and Chocolatey, with Finishing Hints of Hazelnut, Single-Serve Coffee Pods\nReview:\nI had to try this after my initial purchase of the Keyna blend. I simply find this brand very pleasing to the taste buds and senses. Additionally, the fact that their individually wrapped makes the flavor out of this world. You'll know how fresh each cup is going to be every time you open a pouch and get hit by the aroma. If you're tired of \"watered down\" Keurig brands, this is for you. Trust me, I've tried a WHOLE lot of other companies before stumbling on this.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCopper Moon Single Cups for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Kenyan, 20 Count, Medium Roast Coffee, Bold and Chocolatey, with Finishing Hints of Hazelnut, Single-Serve Coffee Pods\nReview:\nThe reviews of this coffee are not exaggerated! I got it today and immediately made a cup to test out all the hype. After all, this is what promoted me to buy this brand in the first place. First thing I noticed and loved is the fact that each pod is individually packed. When you open the seal, it gives you the most amazing aroma explosion ever.\n\nAs I brewed my coffee and savored the aroma, I prayed that the taste would be just as good. Well, I can say that this is some good bold and flavorful coffee. Most importantly, no nasty or bitter aftertaste. Finally, I found a second brand of Kuerig coffee that lives up to it's claims.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['really', 'tea', 'like', 'taste', 'way', 'one', 'time', 'good', 'product', 'purchase']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nMonin Flavored Syrup, Blackberry, 33.8-Ounce Plastic Bottles (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI gave this product a excellent review on my first purchase back in 2010. I am still a fan however, the last purchase on 08/07/2013 the bottles leaked inside the Monin package. Will I purchase again, I'm debating due to the leakage. I've tried another companies brand of syrups and their product came bubble wrapped and had a plastic protection around the capped cap. I apparently can't supply a photo on this site, I did however on the condition of the package when received. Monin needs to take time to ensure that caps are on tight, not even a protection on the top of the bottle, screw off cap only which wasn't secure.\nRating:\n2.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

One of the questions that the chefs were asked was \"What do you eat when no one is watching?\"  In other words, what is your guilty pleasure that might not jive with your being a renowned chef.  The answers were honest and amusing.  Although I am only a foodie and not a chef, if I were asked that question my answer would be \"Hormel Corned Beef Hash.\"\n\nFirst, let me be honest about what this is: this is not something that you would want to eat very often if you were worried about fat or sodium content; the potatoes are dehydrated; and the corned beef tastes a little like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/potted-meat/dp/B0025UCGKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">potted meat</a>.  Still, it is a real comfort food for me and I love it.\n\nI almost always add some freshly diced onions or shallots.  I also add either diced bell pepper or minced Serrano.  I put in it a hot skillet over medium heat and let it cook until crispy.  I flip it and while the other side is cooking I cook an egg or two in a separate skillet and place them, sunny side up, on top of the hash.  I like to finish it off with a generous dose of hot sauce.\n\nI buy this large size when I have guests (I have to admit that not all of my friends or family share my love for this product.)

Coconut milk is usually thick and needs to be remove from the can with a spoon or a spatula.  For that reason I remove the whole lid with a can opener instead of piercing the top of the can and trying to pour it out.\n\nThis is great for making a delicious meal quickly.  I usually add a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/curry-paste/dp/B000QU3JM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">curry paste</a>&nbsp;as well as veggies and some sort of protein, such as chicken or shrimp.  The coconut milk gives the dish an authentic flavor and mellows the spice of the curry paste.\n\nThai Kitchens is one of the more expensive brands on the market but it is consistently the best that I have used.  I don't usually buy the organic version but I like this one as much as I do their non-organic product.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHomemade Dressing Mix Variety Pack (French Garden, Napa Garden &amp; Italian Garden), 3.3 to 4-Ounce Containers\nReview:\nWhen I first received my order of the Italian Dressing mix, I was a little wary. A lot of prepared herb and spice mixes on the market seem to be full chemicals that I can't pronounce and they taste very dull, extremely salty and have a strange, artificial after-taste. NOT THIS ONE!\n\nWhen my order arrived the first thing that I did was to taste the mixture straight out of the jar. I was surprised at how clean and fresh the taste was. I picked up on the herbs (I'm thinking oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary and maybe some mint), the sea salt and then the sweetness of the bell pepper combined with a tartness of the lemon juice. There was a slight bit of heat (the garlic?) and a nice, pure, food-like aftertaste.\n\nNext I mixed it with some fine olive oil and used it as a dip for some crusty Italian bread. Wonderful! Later in the week I used it, along with some Dijon Mustard, as a coating for a rack of lamb. I ended up adding a little crushed black pepper to the mix and it was great.\n\nFinally I used it as a salad dressing along with aged balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. It took a few minutes to get the proportions right, and I did add a little chopped rosemary and some fresh minced garlic. It was much better than any prepared dressing that comes in a bottle.\n\nI was really impressed with the flavor and quality of this prepared mix, so much so that I ordered this variety pack.  Here are my thoughts on the other two varieties that come with this set:\n\n*  French Garden\nAt first taste it seemed salter than the Italian version.  The chives not only tasted fresh but still retained their classic oval shape (meaning that they were not over-processed or ground to death).  The garlic and onions were strong, but not too.  I also picked up on the parsley and I thought I tasted a little tarragon.  I added this mix to a French style omelet (runny).  Very nice!  My fear of it being too salty was put to rest.  I next sprinkled it on some grilled eggplant and I was blown away!  It woke up the subtle flavors of the vegetable.  I will be trying this is other dishes to be sure.\n\n*  Napa Garden\nThis mix had a different texture than the others, probably due to the tomato powder which added a wonderful richness to the blend.  This one was not as salty as the other two.  The pepper gave it a little heat but I usually like more (which is easy to add, hard to take out). I tried this (along with some olive oil) with spinach angel-hair pasta.  That turn out to be a good choice.  The mix did not overwhelm the flavor of the pasta but added that extra kick.\n\nI highly recommend this variety pack.  All three will become staples in my spice cabinet.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRoland Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce, 7 Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nI love all things hot and Chipotle peppers are on the top of my list.

I recently tried the Roland brand and found them to be even better.

I must have seen them before but it wasn't until I had Tempura made table-side that I noticed their exceptional quality. Larger and yet somehow lighter than traditional, western style crumbs they give a pleasing crunchiness and toasty taste to shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, onion rings, and many other foods.\n\nI use this product both with and without Tempura batter. I really love Tempura shrimp and the addition of the Panko crumbs on top of the batter is not only authentic but it significantly adds to the taste of the finished dish. Unlike finer ground bread crumbs the larger sized Panko crumbs don't burn or blacken before the meat or vegetable is done. This is especially helpful when deep-frying larger pieces of food. It is also good on casseroles and certain other dishes that you would usually add regular crumbs to.\n\nI have purchased many different brands over the years. Since Panko crumbs are so much larger and fluffier that a brand like Progresso you usually need more than you might think. I go through an eight or twelve ounce package in just one meal. This larger size 24 ounce package is just the right size. One thing that I really like about this package is that it has a very creative opening an inch or two from the top and it closes with a zip-lock style device. This may seem like a small thing but it is really convenient and helpful, especially for a larger package like this one. That, combined with the quality of the Panko crumbs makes this an exceptional product.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDiedrich Coffee Variety Pack of Medium, Full and Dark Roasts K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 22-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nI have given over 10 Keurig coffee makers as gifts (I do have 6 children after all) and I usually include a couple of variety boxes of coffee with the brewer (a flavored variety and this one).  If the recipient of the Keurig doesn't drink this kind of coffee then they use it to serve to guests that do.\n\nOne thing to point out is that almost all Keurig coffee makers have the ability to make various sizes of cups (the B30 only makes one size).  Some give you two choices and some give you up to five.  Before you are talked out of buying these K-cups because a few other reviewers claim that this coffee isn't bold enough, I would wonder what size of cup they are making.  On my Keurig I can brew a cup as small as 4 oz. and I promise you that it is pretty strong with just about any of the bolder blends.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Coffee-People-Organic-Extra-Bold-K-Cups-for-Keurig-Brewers-Pack-of-50-Amazon-Frustration-Free-Packaging/dp/B002L444OQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nGreen Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, Medium Roast, 24-Count -0.33 oz- K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nI prefer deep, dark roasted coffees but many people don't.  My mother used standard household blends such as Folger's for many years.  When she received her Keuring machine she started to experiment with other brands and blends.  She occasionally drinks a flavored coffee but this has become her favorite.  I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:\n\nThe body (or \"mouth-feel\") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium-low so it won't have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a \"Starbucks-type\" of coffee too strong or bitter.  If you, like my mother, enjoy a \"regular\" blend I don't think that it get's better than this.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGringo Bandito Hot Sauce, Green, 5 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI love hot sauce and have tried hundreds (yes, really that many) and often have about twenty open bottles in my fridge at one time.  There are times that I want a simple puree that contains nothing but peppers.  Other times I like a sauce that is mixed with vinegar, like Tabasco and this sauce.\n\nThe first one that I tried was the red Gringo Bandito sauce.  I liked it was not blown away.  I would give the heat a 3 out 10.  The flavor was rich and well balanced with a nice tomato base and not too much vinegar.  Still, I have several sauces in my pantry with a similar heat and taste profile that I prefer.\n\nNow, the green Gringo Bandito is another story.  I would rate it just a little higher in heat but the flavor really impressed me.  It was the grassy, fresh, and herb-like notes that make this a go-to sauce.  I use it when as a topper for tacos, burritos, and egg dishes but I think that it would get lost in a stew or a chili.  It has earned a permanent spot in my pantry.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTimothy's World Coffee, Variety Pack, 22-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nIt's hard for me the believe this myself but so far I have given 8 Keurig coffee makers away (five model B40s, two B60s and two B70s) as gifts and I always give this sampler to go along with the k-cups included with the machine.  I feel that it includes a very good selection of coffees and teas.  If someone does not like a particular beverage (some people NEVER drink tea for instance) the recipients have found that they can keep them on hand for guests.  This does not include all of my favorites but it does have a very good mix.

I am sure that someone does, just no one that I know.\nItalian Blend:  I usually like an Italian coffee but this one is not popular with my friends, family and guests for some reason.\n\nThere are others in this pack but in my experience these are the ones that the people in my life usually love and the ones that they avoid.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['one', 'like', 'coffee', 'sauce', 'taste', 'flavor', 'would', 'hot', 'little', 'product']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nTrue Orange Crystallized Fruit Wedge, 32 Pack\nReview:\nTrue Orange is awesome.

Sometimes I use 3-4 ounces of it at a time, and it's tiresome grinding my own for that kind of quantity. So I went looking for pre-ground black pepper. I've tried at least a dozen brands, and I would say Watkins is right there at the top of the heap, one of the two or three best I've tried. The flavor is excellent and, while pre-ground pepper is not going to be quite as fresh as grinding it yourself, it seems to have come fresh and stayed fresh. The only thing I don't like about this product is that the tin, which is others quite attractive in a retro kind of way, but thin and flimsy; just the act of picking it up and setting it down on a counter can cause a small dent -- it's that thin! But I'm not docking it a star for that; it's just a container. The product itself -- the black pepper -- is extremely good and well worth the money.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKirkland Signature Fine Ground Black Pepper, 12.3 oz\nReview:\nI use a huuuuuuuuuuge amount of black pepper to make spice rubs and at the grill. This is one of the five I've purchased in the quest to find the perfect one. I do believe this one is best in class. The flavor is excellent, but what I really like about it is that it has a skooch less sting than some of the others - a tiny bit less heat/bitterness. Plus, the pricing is more attractive than some of the boutique brands. I unreservedly give this product 5 stars.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nOlde Thompson 9.75-Ounce Pepper Supreme Whole Peppercorns, Set Of 2\nReview:\nGreat pepper with a stronger, \"bite-ier\" taste than the generic black pepper which came in my grinder.

Don't be fooled by the \"Death Sauce\" moniker. It's pretty mild. Even people unaccustomed to hot peppers will find this sauce \"medium hot\". True chili heads will find it very mild and more of a flavoring sauce than a hot sauce. Overall , it's a superb mild hot sauce with unparalleled flavor and I recommend it highly, unless you're seeking a truly hot hot sauce.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nThe Original Habanero Shaker - 100% Custom Flaked Hot Habanero Chile Peppers\nReview:\nWhen I received this product, I immediately got a take-out pizza so I could pour this stuff all over it. Fantastic!  I like hot foods and normal pepper flakes as served, for example, in a pizzaria don't even register as \"hot\" in my mouth. I long ago switched over to habs and bhuts to get my heat supply. Being very used to and accustomed to the mighty habanero (I've grown them for years, too) I can attest that this product uses very good quality habs. A teaspoon or two in a recipe works wonders, and it works equally well as a condiment. For chiliheads and others just kind of tired of the usual boring, low-heat flakes, this can really perk things up!  Highly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMexican SWP Decaf Organic Coffee, Whole Bean, Swiss Water Processed Decaf Coffee, Fresh Roasted Coffee LLC. (5 lb.)\nReview:\nI am big fan of this company's Ethiopian, so I thought I'd give the Mexican a shot.\n\nThe beans are very oily, literally shining with oil in the bag; I've never seen anything like it. I was wondering whether my burr grinder would get mucked up with all that oil, but it had no problem (though it did take a few more seconds than usual).\n\nThis coffee has an interesting and very different taste, very chocolaty. Kind of like a cafe mocha. I've never actually had a coffee that had such a pronounced chocolate taste before. It makes for a great iced coffee, because it almost tastes like a dessert drink. Hot, though ... I'm just not sure. I find it \"drinkable\" but nowhere near as good as the Ethiopian.\n\nI appreciate the fair and reasonable pricing from FRC LLC. Their 2-pound bags for $21-$26 just really work for me. I find that kind of price much more acceptable than the $16+ a pound seen elsewhere from so many sellers. I also really like the 2-pound bag format, versus 12 oz and 1 pound bags, which I go through in 4-5 days. These 2 pounders last me a couple of weeks.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nPeruvian Decaf Organic Fair Trade Coffee - SMBC, Whole Bean, Water Processed Decaf Coffee, Fresh Roasted Coffee LLC. (2 lb.)\nReview:\nI was very pleasantly surprised by this coffee! Having given up on caffeine for health reasons, I've been working my way through the Amazon decafs. A generally disappointing experience, though some are OK; the problem is that none of them really hit the sweet spot for me in terms of the right mix of flavor, fullness, roast, aroma, etc. So I've been in search of \"The One\" for quite a while -- an economical \"anchor\" coffee I can load up on in 5 lb bags while occasionally supplementing with a lb of more expensive beans -- and I'm thinking this is it.\n\nI've already gone through several pounds of FRC's Ethipian, Mexican and Columbian decafs. I like the taste of the Ethiopian but find it a bit too mild. The Columbian is OK but nothing special, there are better, though not at FRC's price point. The Mexican I didn't care for at all. In general I find FRC's decaf's \"good, but not great, at a very reasonable price\". This one, however, is at least bordering on great.\n\nThis coffee is bold and right on the cusp between medium and dark roast, not solidly in either camp - which is exactly how I like my coffee - a \"strong medium\" roast. I would agree with the vendor's take on the cupping notes: almond, sweet cream, hints of chocolate.\n\nThe beans are very oily, which unfortunately is not usually a sign of quality, but nevertheless, I quite like the flavor, aroma and aftertaste of this coffee. I will for sure be ordering more bags of this one..\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKirkland Signature California granulated garlic, 18 oz\nReview:\nThis is very good garlic.

I usually only buy habanero hot sauces, but lately the heat level has just not been enough for me in the standard habanero offerings. We all know that Naga is hotter than habanero, so I decided to give it a shot, not knowing quite what to expect. I didn't find the heat level all that much higher than a typical habanero sauce like Marie Sharp's Belizean Heat, but the flavor was definitely different. More of a ground (black) pepper kind of taste, with a bit of a sting. I quite liked it and I plan to keep using this sauce. Very versatile - it can be used on pretty much anything you'd put hot sauce on.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAltoids Smalls Peppermint Sugarfree Mints Single Pack, 0.37 ounce\nReview:\nI really love Altoid Smalls.  I became a heavy Altoid user after I quit smoking a few years ago.  They (and Starbrights) were the only things that could stave off my desire to smoke, with their super-strong peppermint taste.  But, of course, regular Altoids are basically pure sugar, and are therefore very bad for the teeth.  And regular Altoids do have calories, too:  3.33 calories each, which adds up if you're chewing through whole tins of them.  So I decided to give the Smalls a try.  Been hooked ever since.  They've replaced EVERY other mint, hard candy and other similar product; in fact, I threw all the others out once I tried these, and haven't gone back.  They aren't pleasantly chalky like regular Altoids, by the way; they have a smooth texture, which is not as good but has its own charm once you adjust to the change.\n\nThe details:\n- the Smalls have a strong taste.  Those who like the burning sensation of strong peppermint will really like these (conversely, those looking for more of a Tic-Tac level strength will be overwhelmed).  Personally, I like the taste a lot.\n- they have no sugar, so you can enjoy them and still have teeth in five or ten years\n- they actually last a pretty long time.  I've gotten as far as 25 minutes on one mint, though 9-10 minutes is more typical.\n- they are a half-calorie each.  An entire tin of 50 of them is only 25 calories.  Even if you consume three tins of them in a day (which I have done) you're still only looking at 75 calories.\n- they do contain Sorbitol, an ingredient in many diet candies and treats which gives some people ... how's a nice way to put this .... gassiness and a need to go to the bathroom frequently.  I seem to have no or very little reaction to Sorbitol.  But I think it's just luck of the draw; my wife reacts badly to it.  However, an entire tin of these only contains 25 calories worth of candy with Sorbitol in it, roughly equivalent to, say, two or three sugar-free Starbrights.  So, even those with some Sorbitol intolerance might not be too bothered by these, if consumed in reasonable quantities.\n\nThe summary:\n\nFor the orally-fixated amongst us, who must have something in their mouths at all times, Altoid Smalls are practically a god-send: a sugar-free, virtually no calorie, strong-tasting mint that tastes pretty good and come in a convenient 50-pack.  As long as you are tolerant of Sorbitol, I think you'll be pretty satisfied with these.  They are not as good as regular Altoids, but have no sugar and practically no calories.  They are a nice alternative.\n\nThe only thing with the Smalls is learning to conserve them.  There is a tendency to pop 3 or 4 of them in the mouth, chew through them, and then pop another 3 or 4.  Getting it down to 1 mint and learning to savor it for a while can knock the daily consumption down from 3-4 tins to 1.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['hot', 'sauce', 'like', 'heat', 'coffee', 'really', 'taste', 'good', 'price', 'one']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nTraditional Medicinals Organic Ginger Herbal Tea, 16 Tea Bags (Pack of 1)\nReview:\nGinger tea is warming, carminative (spicy in a way that helps you digest better) and prevents the feeling of nausea.

In fact, it is so good that my wife simply refers to it as the good tea when requesting a cup. Its delicious.  Like almost all traditional Asian foods, it makes numerous, spurious health claims. None of which I actually believe. This probably isn't going to slim you down or cure what ails you, but it will result in an absolutely wonderful cup of tea.\n\nThe process of preparation does take some studying. Fortunately, there are numerous videos on the internet that will walk you through the process. It is nothing worse than Turkish coffee, which I also love and took some time to learn the proper preparation.  To do it right you will need a few accompanying items, although you will probably be able to improvise. I don't have every recommended cup and tea pot, but it comes out just fine.\n\nI love how many cups of tea you can get from a single brewing. Normally the tea gets weaker and weaker, but this sustains its flavor.  Ive tried both the ripe and raw varieties, and there is a noticeable difference.

I find that too many American-produced green teas are \"watered down\" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.\n\nBy no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTwinings of London Pure Camomile Herbal Tea Bags, 20 Count\nReview:\nTwining's can usually be counted on to put out a decent tea.  They aren't really top grade, but nor are they bottom shelf and make for a fine daily bag tea.\n\nHowever, I found their Green Tea to be a bit bland.  Indeed, it is the \"light flavour strength\", as it says on the box, but I wasn't prepared for just how light the flavor would be.  Supposedly, the tea used here is sencha, but I have had many, many cups of sencha and it generally has a bolder, grassier flavor.\n\nBecause the flavor is so light to begin with, you can't really pull more than one cup out of a bag either.  The next cup is just pretty much colored water, which is disappointing.  A nice strong tea usually yields a few cups, and that saves you some money in the long term.\n\nPeople who don't really enjoy the strong, grassy flavor of green tea might find this a nice balance.  It is easy to make, easy to drink and will probably suit many people.  I was looking for a decent bagged Green Tea to keep at work, but I think I will keep hunting as the flavor was too light for me.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nGood Earth Green Tea, Jasmine, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI got excited when I saw this in the tea collection at work.  Jasmine Green Tea?  I love Jasmine Green Tea!  So I had a cup ... and it was awful.  I thought maybe I somehow had a bad cup, so I tried a different tea bag ...  yuck.\n\nIt's hard to describe just how bad this tastes.  Imagine a cup of green tea that someone poured some jasmine-scented perfume into.  Or maybe dissolved some jasmine-flavored candy into.  I saw someone say it was Pez flavored, and I can agree with that. But no matter how you describe it, it is undrinkable.  Second cup was poured down the sink.\n\nAnd it isn't just the initial taste.  Somehow this coats your tongue and the badness sticks with you.  I suspect this box is going to be sitting around the office for a long, long time.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nONE ORGANIC Matcha Green Tea Powder (250g) - USDA Certified Organic\nReview:\nWe use this matcha green tea powder for pretty much everything other than making tea. My wife is Japanese, and likes making various matcha sweets--matcha cookies, matcha ice cream, matcha cheese cake, matcha muffins--pretty much every thing you can imagine. And while I am not Japanese, I love eating all the matcha creations she makes.\n\nWe go through a fair share of matcha, and were eager to try this \"One Organic Matcha green tea powder.\" This is culinary grade matcha, which is perfect for her purposes. It isn't that bright, vivid green of tea grade matcha, but doesn't cost as much either. And it comes in a nice big bag--we were both pleasantly surprised by the quantity.\n\nShe has baked up a few treats using this matcha, and is happy with the results. It gives a nice, strong matcha flavor. You don't need to add a lot to get the matcha taste, so I have a feeling this bag is going to go a long way.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nChoice Organic Teas Green Tea, Genmaicha, 16 Count, Pack of 6\nReview:\nI became a regular green tea drinker during the years I lived in Japan, and although I prefer loose-leaf tea I wanted some tea bags that I could drink at work.  Genmai tea is one of my favorites, and I tried this \"Choice Organic Genmai\" thinking it might be an affordable, convenient way to brew up some of that delicious roasted rice flavor.\n\nLike many, I found these tea bags to be drinkable but weak.  I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the loose-leaf tea I buy, but I also wasn't expecting it to be so watery.  You can get a decent cup of tea out of it if you make a small cup, but I really wish it was more robust.\n\nI will keep drinking my way through the box I bought, but I don't think I will go back for seconds.  There are probably better tea bag Genmais out there.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nStash Tea Organic Earl Grey Green and Black Tea 100 Count Tea Bags in Foil (Packaging May Vary) Individual Tea Bags for Use in Teapots Mugs or Cups, Black Tea and Green Tea, Brew Hot or Iced\nReview:\nMy two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.\n\nAnd it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct \"earl grey\" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.\n\nI don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMorning Pep Goji Berries Raw Sundried, FFP, 32 Ounce\nReview:\nSo right off the bat--forget all the \"health claims\" you might hear about Goji Berries. There is no such thing as a miracle food, and while they might supply some solid vitamins and fiber eating these berries is most likely going to do nothing spectacular for your health.\n\nWith that out the way, we can get to the important part: How do they taste?\n\nPretty good! Even though I lived in Asia for many years, I had never tried goji berries before (also know by the much cooler name of wolfberries). However they have a familiar taste of sour/sweet that I associate with Asian cooking. These are dried, and are essentially snack food, although you can use them for a variety of versatile cooking. I've actually found they go good roasted with chicken. But for the most part I mix them up with some cocoa nibs and nuts and other tasty treats to make a crunch mid-day snack at work. Apparently you can boil them for tea, but I haven't tried that yet.\n\nI've tried a few Morning Pep products now, and they never fail to delight. Just seeing their name on the package makes me want to give it a try, and I am glad I had the chance to sample these goji berries.\n\nSample provided for review.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nIsland Fresh Superior Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 Ounce\nReview:\nI love cooking with coconut oil. It melts nice, adds a distinct flavor and aroma to cooking, and just works in ways that butter and other oils can't. I don't cook everything with it, but for some things like pancakes and eggs and even softening vegetables for soup it just works great. I have quickly gone through every jar I've ever bought.\n\nThis Island Fresh is a huge tub that promises to last me awhile. I'm a bit suspicious of the \"extra virgin\" label, as that seems just pure marketing. This isn't olive oil--no need to borrow the language! But silly marketing aside, this is high quality product that I am happy to cook with.

It tastes so much better compared to the non-organic stuff, I honestly cannot even drink the other stuff anymore. This has a much more real tea taste as it should. 100 tea bags will go a long way for just one person.\n\nYou should however be advised that this seems to have a lot of caffeine in it, unless you do a short brew. One cup is enough to get my heart going a little, so I only make small batches at a time.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice iced tea recipe then I have one I made just for you :)\n\nI spent a little over an hour perfecting this tea recipe to get an amazing iced tea each time. A lot of taste testing when into this tea to get it just right. The taste is not overpowering, but just enough where you can enjoy it as if you bought the perfect tea from the store. Makes one gallon.\n\nDo not drink this tea until it's completely cold or else when you add ice it will be all watered down and taste bad.\n\nThe sugar may need to be adjusted to your liking. In this tea you can just taste it. Feel free to add an extra half cup if you like it really sweet, but I find it's overpowering for a tea.\n\nWhat you will need:\n\nRoyal Tea Black Organic - Of course :)\n\nOrganic Meyer Lemon - Not as sour as regular lemons, has a more tropical taste too. These might be hard to find. Do not use pure lemon juice! You can check doortodoororganics.com if they deliver to your area.\n\nOrganic Sugar - Regular sugar may be used if preferred. You could also use raw organic honey, about 8 tablespoons. If you use honey make sure it's from Y.S. Eco Bee Farms. Honey must be added while the water is hot.\n\nFirst Step: Bring 1 gallon of filtered water to a medium boil, then remove from heat. Tap water can be used, but let sit uncovered for 24 hours before using because chlorine is added to town/city water. Boil the water for 10 minutes at a rolling boil after 24 hours to sterilize if you let sit out.\n\nSecond Step: With the water removed from the heat add 6 tea bags and let steep for 1 full hour. If you wish to have a more stronger brew use 8 tea bags. Make 3 semi-thin slices of lemon, remove seeds then squeeze into tea. After squeezing drop the slices into the tea and let the slices steep for half hour, then remove. You don't need to worry about removing all the lemon juice as it will be steeping. I find a quick squeeze works fine. It is important you remove the slices after half hour to prevent an overpowering lemon taste. Some pulp will be left behind, and that is OK.\n\nThird Step: After 1 whole hour remove the tea bags. Add 1 1/2 cups of sugar and stir. Let cool, then add to pitcher. Place into fridge. Serve over ice when completely cool.\n\nIf you've made this right you will have tea tasting as if it were made by a pro! :)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTwinings of London Pure Camomile Herbal Tea Bags, 20 Count\nReview:\nThank you, Critic-At-Large. You've saved me a bunch of money by switching to Twinings.\n\nI was also a on the go tea drinker, as much as three times a day everyday. It was not until I seen the top review that I decided to add up the cost of the tea I was buying from Dunkin Donuts. After going through hundreds of my purchases on my bank account (excluding cash purchases) it worked out to $1,532.16 in tea alone. Now if I included cash that amount would be even higher. Crazy.\n\nHere is a twist, Dunkin Donuts actually happens to use Orange Pekoe tea so it's very easy to recreate it. One tea bag for every 12oz of water and let steep for half an hour. Tasted the same if not better. Twinings has forever won me as a customer.\n\n10/10 would buy this amazing tea again.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nOrville Redenbacher's Ultimate Butter Popcorn, 3.29 Ounce Classic Bag, 6-Count, Pack of 6\nReview:\nGood popcorn that pops very well.

It didn't seem to be a problem with Prime shipping. Perhaps others used the slower shipping and it melted in transit? Either way, chocolate is something you don't want sitting in shipment for a long time. Use Prime's 2 day, or even next day it if you want.

That was pretty convenient, and it actually worked as advertised!  It wasn't even too hot to carry!\n\nOK, what about the food?\n\nTo start with I'm just a regular guy who usually makes my lunches of the previous night's family dinner left-overs...i.e., not a gourmet, but not taste-dead either...\n\nI was pleased to find that the pasta cooked well, but be advised that if you don't shake the pasta down before you cook it you might find a piece here and there that still has hard spots in it.  There was plenty of sauce...no skimping on sauce volume, and the portion size was great for lunchtime.  I wasn't stuffed when I was done, but I wasn't still hungry either.\n\nThe meat sauce was tangy and mildly spicy.  The meat sauce contained small chunks of beef (i.e., looked like hamburger), and you could tell what it was if you looked closely.  The pasta and sauce consistency was good, and I enjoyed the entire meal.  Be advised that the sauce contains onion and garlic.  If you know you have an important meeting or date later on, you will probably want to pack some mints.  Say, that would be a great addition...an after-meal mint included with each meal that you can use to fight post-meal garlic breath.\n\nIf you like the combination of convenience and pasta, this may well an excellent choice for you.\n\nIf you are also environmentally conscious, though, you should probably think twice about this unit.  Once you are done with your meal there's really not much you can do with the packaging...just recycle it.  If, however, the packaging included a solid lid rather than just the strainer lid, the main container could be washed and then reused as a food storage container...alas, that is not the case.\n\nAnyway, I thought the food was flavorful, the portion was adequate, and the convenience excellent.  Environmental challenges drop the rating by a star though.\n\nLastly, you'll have to determine whether the per unit cost makes this a good deal for you.\n\n4 stars\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I am not denying that some people are sensitive to MSG, although it is much lower than initially thought during the 90's msg scare (much).  Most people are as tolerant to it as they are table salt, so like table salt, use it in moderation (unless you get headaches from it, a sign that you are intolerant and should avoid it).  I'm not an MSG lover or hater, I'm just noting that I am aware of the MSG in this product and for my own personal use, I am okay with it.\n\nSo please... let me just say that I like this product.  For a jarred instant soup type product, it really nails the flavor of tom yum.  I think it's great and a good price.  So if MSG is not for you, don't freak out and hate the product, or my review, just move on to something that fits your lifestyle.  If you think you'd be okay with that and want to try the product then go ahead and try it.  If you have any questions let me know how I can make this review more helpful and I'll give it a shot!

I wish there was a variety pack that I could purchase as they have many other flavors; lemon, fudge, coconut, cinamon.  DARE also has a brand called Bear Paws which are pre-packed in pairs and are great for the kids' lunches.  We also use the Bear Paws to make icecream sandwiches.

We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.\n\n I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost.\n\nUPDATE: Dr Pete is gross just like cherry cola. Here is a secert for all thoes who like cherry cola but hate Dr Pete like I do. Buy a bottle of DaVinci cherry syrup and add 1 oz. to a 1 liter bottle of Sodastream cola, you got cherry cola. Great part you can get diet cherry syrup to use with diet cola syrup, works the same.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCHIQUILIN Smoked Paprika, 75 GR\nReview:\nnot a big paprika eater so don't know how to judge this.

The images of Twinings tea tins do not possess the strength rating, however, when I received my tins they both had three tea leaf strengths on the front of the tin.  I cannot explain the disparity in strength rating between teabag and tin for the Irish Breakfast tea.\n\nMy reason for buying Irish Breakfast tea was for my first cup of tea, higher strength than their English Breakfast tea.  Amazon should correct this by getting Twinings to send updated images.  Similarly, written descriptions fail to indicate Twinings tea strengths using Twinings tea leaf rating system.

I whipped out my trusty Braun bean grinder, opened the package and took a sniff. It smells great. We often use a French Press or the Keurig for coffee and this week I also tried a new k-cup so I figured I would brew this the same way. I really enjoyed the new Smooth k-cups and gave it 4 stars because they too had an unrealistic price tag. Reviewing needs to be based on the actual price of the item, not the discounted price for testing.\n\nI am giving this one 4 stars because to be honest, while it made a perfectly drinkable cup of coffee, it was no better than the coffee I already buy and pay a lot less for or the whole beans I buy at a local health food type box store for around $10, $6 on sale, per pound. It wasn't bitter but I also didn't find it to be tremendously smooth or bold above other coffees I have tried. It's a decent cup of coffee. No one disliked it but no one said it was the best coffee they had tried either.  For a $17.99 per pound Amazon Prime Price, I expected something better than what I can get for much less... I can get three pounds of great beans for this same price. I would give the coffee I already drink 4 stars and since this is the same, I can only give it four stars as well because I can't give it 3.5\n\nIf you have any questions pertaining to this product, feel free to post them.\nI will do my best to answer them in a timely manner.\n\nPlease note ****\n*** I was chosen to test this Amazon item and received it at a reduced price/free for product testing and providing my impartial opinion.\nI have left this review to assist other Amazon shoppers in making informed buying decisions, not to advertise for the seller.\nI received no other compensation for this product and have no personal relationship with the seller.\nI enjoy product reviewing but take product testing / reviewing seriously.

While the doctors put her on medication, over time we found they just interrupted her sleep too much and caused energy crashes. She does not digest caffeine well so that wasn't an option either. She is now making green smoothies, using fresh almond milk and doing other things to help her energy levels, with two small children, both having special needs, and not being a morning person.. she decided to try green teas.  Our family has tried 4 or 5 Matcha powders to this date and this one is a favorite. Matcha has apx 1/3rd of the caffeine but seems to have just the right amount of caffeine and nutrients to give her that much needed boost without any side effects.\n\nCeremonially, Matcha is to be finished in two gulps and a sip. She has found she can whip this up with butter and coconut cream and have a nice bulletproof Matcha in the morning to get her going. Matcha tends to taste kind of grass and earth like... butter and coconut cream even out the flavor and give her brain a much needed boost.\n\nIt arrives in a cute sturdy aluminum container with an inner seal cap and the Matcha tucked inside a sealed bag.\n\nCurrent price is $24.95 for 30 gram - ounce.. which is on the high side of the Amazon competitive market\n\nIf you have any questions pertaining to this product, feel free to post them.\nI will do my best to answer them in a timely manner.\n\nI was chosen to receive this item at a reduced price/free for consumer testing and Amazon consumer product reviewing.

It is obviously coconut in the bag, just tiny flakes. Other coconut flours I have used looked more like flour than coconut.  It works well, be sure to add a bit more moisture because it is so absorbent compared to wheat, but some people may want to grind it again. It is very light in color and looks to been dried at low temps but I don't see anything specifying if this was dried in a dehydrator to keep it raw. If things are cooked above 118, it destroys the enzymes in the food. I think I am going to use this more as a topping crunch or filler rather than a flour. It is pretty to look at and the shreds are tiny but large enough to slightly taste. I also like the crispy texture before hydrating.\n\nCurrent pricing is $10.47 a pound.

I can't say this Healthworks outshines other good brands out there but I have no complaints. I have always been happy with Healthworks products and this coconut oil is very nice. It has a beautiful coconut fragrance and taste, very white, comes with a seal on the jar and the jar is sturdy. I eat it right out of the jar and it tastes great. That is always my test for coconut oil. How it tastes and melts in the mouth.. your testing may vary. lol\n\nI noticed a one star review with a different labeled product jar and name, complaining about the lack of USDA label, (mine does have the usda label) no expiration date and a \"watery\" texture. I am not sure if people know coconut oil melts at 76 degrees F. You put coconut oil in a warm box truck and you are going to get melted coconut oil when delivered.  This product also arrived \"watery\" yet reset in a colder temp. I have uploaded photos to show you.\n\nAs for an expiration date, I have had many oils without expiration dates. But... expiration dates do not mean the expiration safety of a product. The labels are arbitrary and do not have much meaning. Your coconut oil storage, usage and weather will affect your expiration date. No company can control how you safely use and store products. That being said.. everyone should teach themselves the signs of a rancid oil. A rancid oil has a very distinct pungent aroma that is not hard to notice. Coconut oil in general is very slow to turn rancid. Outside conditions are the main factors in coconut oil going bad.\n\nSigns of Rancid Coconut Oil:\n\n1. Yellow in color when melted (Possible but not always accurate since filtering can produce a slightly yellow coconut product)\n2. Blotchy, in color and texture when not melted\n3. It will taste off, or bad and smell weird and different than what a fresh jar smells like\n4. Signs of spots growing which could be mold.. the main reason for this happening is due to owner usage. Dirty spoons, double dipping, getting water or other food bits, saliva in the coconut oil, dirty conditions, improper storage. We store ours in the fridge.\n\nGood coconut oil will be clear when melted and white when solidified. The in between stages will produce cloudy coconut oil.\n\nMy jar does have the meaningless usda seal.. and I say this because if you are paying attention to the past 50 years of any political entity, they are the ones failing the masses and their labels mean nothing. I have uploaded a photo showing the front of the 32 ounce container I received.\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nI upload photos and or videos on the vast majority of all my reviews.

I've tried just about every coffee you could name, including coffees which I paid somewhere around a hundred dollars a pound; I can't remember exactly how much, but it was very close to that figure.\nIn order for me to get what I would call a great cup of coffee, I started roasting my own beans, in fact, I still have several pounds of green beans I purchased mostly at Sweet M.'s.\nI hand grind my beans using a conical burr grinder (zaussenhaus), which I find superior to any other way of grinding, (a close second, is mortar, and pestle grinding).\nI've tried every way possible, and I do mean that literally...every...way....you could name for coffee brewing, the best two methods for making a great cup of coffee are percolated, and vacuum.  I threw my French Press in the trash where it belongs, that method was the absolute worse way to brew coffee IMO, I didn't even want to give it to anyone, I tried that method for several Months just to be certain there could be no user error...but into the trash it went!\nMy Keurig, I did give that away as that was not as bad as the French Press, but still not for me.  I've brewed Greek, and Turkish using the Ibirk..etc. Automatic drip brewing is IMO for lazy people who are not that into having a great cup of coffee.  Again, without a doubt, (howbeit not well accepted by the parrots/sheep of the world)...is perked, and vacuum brewing methods.  One more brewing method that is not that bad, is pour over, but that would be my last resort brewing method.\n\nNow that I've somewhat set the stage, let me get to this coffee.  It is going to be hard pressed to find a better coffee than this. I will reserve this being the best until I try all of Pablo's Pride coffee's, (sans decaf).\nThis is a wonderful coffee, I don't think I could roast a better bean, so it looks as though my green beans will be relegated to becoming green bean extract, which is in, and of itself not a true relegation, but only as far as brewing coffee is concerned.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrench Market Coffee &amp; Chicory Decaffeinated, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nIt okay, I prefer plain coffee like Folger's Columbian.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nOberto All Natural BBQ Seasoned Pork Jerky, 3.25 Ounce Bag (Pack Of 4)\nReview:\nOnce this jerky is eaten I don't know how anyone can eat any other jerky.\nIt's like driving a Ferrari, and then comparing that to driving a Ford.\n\nSimply put, this jerky is absolutely the best.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nigourmet Parmigiano Reggiano 24 Month Top Grade - Pound Cut (15.5 ounce)\nReview:\nFirst of all let me state that the seller, (Mondo), was great to deal with. However, since this is a product review, let me review the cheese.\nI'm a 68 year old Italian that was raised in an Italian neighborhood. I went to Italian Deli's all my life, I must have eaten literally hundreds, nay, thousands of pounds of Parmigiano Reggiano in my life.\nThis is some of the worst P.R. I've ever had.....NO...this IS the worst I've ever had!!\n\nThere are practically none of the little white crystals I seek in a good P.R., I can actually COUNT the number of little crystals I see. (I actually counted 7 crystals in two pounds of cheese)!!\n\nI like the seller, not the cheese.  This has to be IMO, the lowest grade of P.R., and in fact, if it was not for seeing the stamp on the rind, (its not the stamp I like to see, but it is stamped), I would even question its authenticity.\nThis is not a good table cheese,(as far as P.R. goes),it is only (at BEST) barely good enough to be grated on macaroni.\n\nNow, I have to try and find some good Parmigiano Reggiano, as the store near me where I now live has closed.\n\nSorry, but I have to tell it like it is.\n\nIf I could, I would give this \"Parmigiano Reggiano cheese\" a zero star rating!  I feel as though I've simply thrown money away, as I won't eat this crap that is trying to disguise itself as Parmigiano Reggiano!\n\nLet me say this to its defense, as I really like this seller. The price for this cheese is amazing, even factoring in shipping, this price cannot be beat. I used to pay over $25.00 a pound for the good P.R., and that was years ago.\nI took a gamble, and lost. If you have not been spoiled by having real P.R. your entire life, then this cheese might be good for you, it is not for me.\n\nThe problem is that now I'm leery of buying any P.R. from Amazon.

I opened the container, poured in a pack of ingredients that was in the box, put under my Kurieg coffee maker for the hot water, stirred. I did add a pinch of salt and pepper. And I did transfer the soup to a bowl. Then I curled up in my sweats and dome crusty bread in tow and had one of the most amazingly good bowls of super- I've had in a long long time.

But the flavor and the depth of flavor is phenomenal and the fish itself is much more delicate in flavor and texture than tuna is (not that they are anything like tuna, but it's the only other canned fish I'd previously eaten).\n\nThey were great just out of the can cold, but better heated up (a minute or two in the microwave, ten or so in the oven).

I will have to admit that the waffles I ate this morning were very good.  I followed the instructions on the back of the box but I was only able to make 4 -- 7 waffles.  My waffle maker does make large waffles so that really does not have anything to do with the mix.  I was a little worried when I had mixed everything up as instructed and the mix was a little runny.  But the waffles turned out GREAT.  The waffles had a very good taste and looked good on my plate.  I will definitely let my daughter now about the Simple Mills brand.  Knowing her, she is probably already using your products.  I did like the suggestions on the back of the box regarding adding pecans or fresh berries.  Always forget about those until its to late.  I had pecans in the house so i chopped a bunch of those up and added them to the batter.  Great suggestion.  This is a very good product.\nUPDATE...Yes my daughter already uses the Simple Mills pancake mix.  She eats everything gluten free due to help her gluten intolerance.\nShe has them at least once a week.  She told me that several times she will make her breakfast pancakes for dinner at night.  She has never had a problem with this product.  She says it is really good stuff.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nClamato Tomato Cocktail, 64  Fl. Oz\nReview:\nI have two  46 ounce bottles of V-8 Spicy Hot Juice in the frig right now so there will be some comparisons made between the Clamato and V-8 juices. I received one bottle of the Clamato under the Vine program. The Clamato is made up of 38% juice while the V-8 is 100%. Both are a cocktail. The Clamato has 60 calories per 8 ounces while the V-8 has 50 calories per 8 ounces. The V-8 has 650 mg sodium while Clamato has 790 mg sodium.\nThe taste of the juices are definitely among cocktail lines with the Clamato having a more thin liquid and watered down taste while the V-8  juice is thicker and heavier to the taste. If left in the frig for a few days both will need to be shaken before using as there seems to be a clear liquid that will appear on top of the liquid.\nThe taste for each is acceptable as a cocktail mixer and both have about the same kick when it comes to hotness. The Clamato contains MSG while I do not locate tat on the bottle of the V-8. I personally think either would be fine as a cocktail mixer and would result in about the same taste thus this becomes a personal preference for the buyer, however due to the thickness of the V-8 the Clamato might be more preferable when mixing with beer.  I will lean more to the V-8 juice since it is 100% juice, more favorable and thicker. I often drink it as a drink and not as a mixer.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nCafe Du Monde Coffee Chicory, 15 Ounce Ground\nReview:\nI used to travel to New Orleans just about every week and was always offered coffee with chickory. I got used to it after a few years and got to where regular coffee seemed weak. Then I quit traveling to New Orleans and started drinking coffee without chickory. I was just fine, until  few weeks ago we went to New Orleans and I stopped at the cafe Du Monde for coffee. Got back on the chickory \"kick\" once again and brought home a can of their chickory flavored coffee. We personally like he taste and my wife thinks it is too strong. It is very good coffee and if one is looking for an instant dramatic change to what they have been drinking they should sip on a few cups of this coffee.

We use the \"Original\" which is made form Canola Oil. There are zero calories, zero saturated fats, zero sodium and zero sugars. While nothing seems to keep casseroles from completely sticking to the cooking pan, PAM does help but does not keep some of the casserole contents from sticking to the side or bottom of the baking dish. Perfect  for coating those waffle irons before cooking waffles and we found that one spraying will last through several cookings of the waffles. Just use it two nights ago to cook in the skillet some ham and cheese sandwiches. They were deep brown, crispy and delicious.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCommunity Coffee Whole Bean Coffee, Decaffeinated Cafe Special\nReview:\nWe are not coffee experts however we do like a good cup of coffee and have to drink decaf since that is the doctor's orders in order to reduce our caffeine intake.

I am not a big fruity or flavor tea drinker but I do drink green tea.  So when this came available, I decided to give Orange Passionfruit Jasmine Green Tea a try.  The best I can say is that is OK.  Sorry.  There was a hint of the Jasmine, which I did not mind.  But I could not taste nor smell the orange.  I love orange and was hoping for a bigger taste or smell of Orange, since it is listed as the first item after green tea.  This is a very light ice tea.  Lipton touts on the side of the box about how their tea is Rainforest Alliance Certified.  I guess I was not impressed.  So many companies taut this kind of stuff and all they do is make a donation for certification.  I don't know what is required for this certification so when I do see these things, it does nothing for me.  This is a LIPTON product, which I do drink a lot of their teas.  I even drink the 20 0z Diet Green Tea they package.  All in all, this is a good tea, from a good company.

If you are in that stage where you are transitioning your child from formula to milk and your child eats their fruits and veggies I highly recommend this as it is much easier on my children's stomachs than regular milk is and it has more nutritional value. However, if you have a very picky eater I suggest something with a higher nutritional value than this product, such as pediasure or pediasmart. While those products are more expensive I believe they offer better nutrition per serving. If, however, your child will eat a variety of foods and you just want something more nutritious than just plain milk, this is a great value at a great price.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

My goodness, I bought a whole case of these seeing as I love Lo Mein.  Well, search further if you are looking for the real thing.  Here it appears like broken spaghetti, and the flavor packet obviously has a lot of bouillon in it, so you get broken spaghetti with salty chicken imitation flavoring.  How healthy, but then if you don't know what good Lo Mein is, and if you like spaghetti, you may be happy with it.  It isn't awful tasting but not that good tasting and definitely not the same texture as Lo Mein.  The box makes the noodles look bigger and they are actually somewhere between angel hair and regular spaghetti size.  It's just not what it says, and it is not good for you.  And, a lot of Asian food is rice noodles or something much more healthy.  Once this is cooked up it does finally make more than what it initially looks like (very little), but really not all that much.  Betty needs to remember that Asian meals are served with big helpings and this was probably a little less than the size of one real Asian dinner helping.  I was disappointed all around on this product.  Here's something odd, the picture of the product that goes with this review is in a totally different box than what I got.  The boxes I got are red and don't disclose it's Betty Crocker except a small spoon on one side.  It's almost an attempt to leave the name off.  Not the norm for this on, company.

It's extremely messy since the pieces are small and it is not moist like regular coconut.  At any rate, I used it for a German chocolate cake.  It was good but just wasn't like the normal coconut.  I've found some coconut is too sweet.  This only has it's natural flavor.  I would buy the sweetened next time since not all brands are over-sweet.  Some would say this is way under-sweet.

I'm amazed as well as grateful the price is kept as economical as it is (we working class thank you!) because there are a lot of crappy teas out there that charge a lot more and tout quality that is just not there.  I won't name names but if you are a tea lover you know what I mean.  For the price you would pay for Lipton's in the U.S. you can be enjoying a much, much better tasting, consistently good tea from the first bag to the last damned good tea!\nRemember that the Tetley sold in the U.S. IS NOT THE SAME!!! Get the Tetley with the English pricing on it to be sure.  Or from a vendor that is honest and states it is from England and if you buy in bulk/large amount (like here at 240ct) it only costs a little more that American grocery store tea and you are getting one of the best English teas on the market.

Given that we have a family member who requires a very low sodium diet, quick and easy breakfast options can be slim on our typically busy mornings.  And if I have time in the mornings, I would rather spend those minutes staring into a gigantic cup of steaming coffee than stirring a pulsating pot of steel cut or rolled oats. So, with great determination to overhaul our breakfast routine. Tipping towards ease of production and nutrition, I began my search for low sodium, high fiber, no added sugar, no or low sodium foods.\n\nLordy! What an experience in researching products that fit my criteria. And, it's amazing what manufacturers put in food to enhance flavor.\n\nI finally decided to try Nature's Path Organic Oatmeal Original Flavor. What really sealed the deal was the comment that one reviewer made, that his wife just poured boiling water over it and let it sit for five minutes. I ordered the oatmeal and have used boiling water each time and it turns out perfectly. The oatmeal is good. It has a slightly nutty, earthy flavor. The oats are rolled, so they hold their texture. I add about two tablespoons of golden raisins to the mixture before I pour boiling water on it, so that the raisins give the oatmeal the perfect level of sweetness needed without added sugar. All in all, I just like the wholeness and goodness of a purely unadulterated oat product like these for breakfast.\n\nNow . . .on Amazon's product page for this product there is a picture of the box this oatmeal comes in. On the front of the box,it says \"NO SUGAR OR SALT ADDED\". But, the Amazon description says that it has a sprinkling of flavor enhancing sea salt. So, I picked up the phone and called the company in Washington state. The company said the Amazon description is incorrect. There is no added salt. They have tried to get Amazon the change the description to no avail.  Also, the company is very nice to deal with and they appreciate consumer questions and feedback.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a sodium free oatmeal product, this product has no added salt.\n\nSo, overall, this is an excellent product. Healthy, easy to make, good flavor and quality.

The blackberry and blueberry taste are apparent in its flavor without having that after bite of bitterness that blackberries and blueberries can have. I have even frozen this juice in ice cube trays and popped the ice cubes in tall glasses and poured cold, unsweetened iced tea over them. Add a sprig of mint and no sugar is needed in your tea.  I also like to pour two cups of this juice in a blender. Add fresh fruit like peaches, pineapples, strawberries, a zing of lemon juice, a handful or two of ice cubes and whir around until it makes a slushy drink.\n\nI actually ordered this on a whim. We had been ordering and will continue to order the cranberry-cherry juice as it was a favorite, but we find that this is a new favorite too!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDoctor Kracker Organic Crispbread, Seeded Spelt, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nA note from Mrs. l-\n\nI think this is really my \"go to cracker\" when I am craving something delicious, crunchy and visually appealing to eat. These crackers look like something you might find in a great bakery or in a super cookbook like Moosewood genre. (Not that anyone could create something so crisp and delicious).  Some of the ingredients could have had the potential to overwhelm the tastebuds, but the recipe apparently developed into a subtle combination of flavors that led to something quite delicious. I especially like that the cheese flavor is a milder cheddar without a sharp bite and the organic pumpkin seeds are a sweet, nutty note. Pumpkin seeds that are not organic are often subtly bitter. These are happily not!\n\nWhile one might be happy to munch on just the cracker by itself, these flatbreads are delicious with egg salad, salmon spread, tuna salad, hot vidalia onion spread, curried chicken salad. A messy, but happy snack or lunch involves a light smear of mayo, a sprinkling of fresh basil, a thick slice  of tomato and a sprinkle of grated cheese. Broil until cheese is bubbly. Oh! My! The cracker really holds its weight with wetter foods like sliced veggies. A light spread of creamed cheese topped with a length-wise slice of cucumber and thinly sliced sweet onions is manageable for a delectable lunch without throwing crackers pieces from here to Mars.\n\nThe only problem I would note is that there are 150 mg of sodium in one piece.  And, I am not a fan of palm oil because its production can pose harmful effects on the environment. We just choose to eat few products with palm oil in it and this is one of the two products we consume with palm oil.\n\nAnyway, to conclude, a major favorite food item. Not just for snacking. Love a slice with a buttery poached egg. I have even run a package through the food processor to make great crumbs for breading fish or chicken strips to bake in the oven. Also as a cracker component for salmon cakes.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKirkland Signature Organic Strawberry Spread - 42 Oz (2lb), Made with Fresh Strawberries, 65% Fruit, Preserves, Jam\nReview:\nThis is the best strawberry jam ever! Slightly tart, sweet, pure strawberry taste.  Far superior product to popular jams which often seem to have a cloyingly sweet, gummy texture.  I added a heaping teaspoonful to a cup of plain yogurt and it was delicious. My husband loved it on hot buttered toast with a cup  of steaming coffee on yesterday's chilly morning. Excellent purchase for a jam lover.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nOregon Specialty Fruit, Dark Sweet Cherries, Pitted, All-Natural, 15 Ounces, 3-Pack\nReview:\n A review from Mrs. L. \n\nThese are absolutely delicious!  The cherries hold their cherry-like texture and are not mushy. Their color is great. I will say that I drain the juice off because it is a bit on the sweeter side. I had originally ordered the cherries to use in a favorite muffin recipe. They were perfect for muffins and cakes. But, we have found we also just like them plain for dessert.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPlanters Unsalted Dry Roasted Peanuts, 35 Ounce\nReview:\na review from Mrs. L-\n\nI don't normally buy Planters nuts because they are very salty and oily.  In looking for unsalted nuts I came across these on Amazon and ordered them.  They are delicious. Perfectly roasted.  We have enjoyed them plain as a snack, sprinkled on salads, blended with oil in the blender to make peanut butter.  They are sweet and flavorful. One might even not notice that they are unsalted because the flavor is so good.  A nice food product for individuals on low sodium diets or who just don't want to consume highly salted foods.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKraft Three Cheese Ranch Dressing &amp; Dip, 16-Ounce Plastic Bottles (Pack of 6)\nReview:\n a review from Mrs. L. \n\nThis salad dressing is absolutely delicious. It has a smooth, savory flavor that does not overwhelm one's salad. Rather it enhances the flavor of the salad. The cheeses are not strongly flavored. The vinegar is not strongly flavored. More of a subtle tang as to not overwhelm the creaminess of the dressing. The thing that I really loved about the flavor is that it did not leave that heavy, chemical aftertaste that some ranch or cheesy dressings can leave in your mouth. There is a delicious, savory aftertaste that does not linger on.\n\nI have made pasta salad with it. Yummo! I have used it as a dip with fresh vegetables.i used it with great success as a dressing for coleslaw.  I used it instead of mayo on a tomato sandwich.  I dunked a few roasted Brussel sprouts in it. Oh. My. Word. That was tasty. But, my favorite use has been on a chopped romaine salad with diced Roma tomatoes, finely chopped sweet onions, organic raisins, sliced dead ripe, but crisp Asian pears and chopped hazelnuts and pecans.  I could eat this salad every day. The dressing makes it a perfect flavor event!\n\nI was concerned that 2 tablespoons of the dressing contained 300 mg of sodium. That was excessive. But when I compared it to the Light version of this dressing there was 460 mg of sodium in the lighter version. So, I ordered the regular variety and try not to use as much.\n\nI will say that I think this is going to be one of my favorite dressings. It just has an appealing flavor. There is the sensation of 'satisfaction' for me after having eaten it that it was an enjoyable taste experience. So far, I haven't tired of it and thoroughly enjoy my daily salads with this dressing.\n\nOh, and I also,like it that the top on the bottle opens in a flip top through which you squeeze the dressing through a hole in the top. That makes it so much easier to put on a salad when it doesn't come out in a gigantic 'glop'.  The protective cover is very easy to remove off of new bottles.\n\nI have just thoroughly enjoyed this addition to my salad routine!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLundberg Family Farms Wehani Rice, 16 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nA review from Mrs. L. Delicious. Nutty. Full of flavor. Chewy. A true favorite. We cook the entire bag at one time and have it as sides or incorporated in soups or main dishes all week. When I was sick last week, I drank vast quantities of garlicky chicken broth. My husband would scoop this wild rice into a bowl and pour steaming hot broth over it. A fragrant, hearty comfort-food addition to the broth which sustained me through the week.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCamellia Large Dry Lima Beans 1 Pound Bag\nReview:\n A review from Mrs. L. My father-in-law was such a grand soul. Highly educated, well read, artistic, Loved classical as well as contemporary music. Recited poetry from memory at the breakfast table. He did not tolerate cooking very well, preferring to load the table with sumptuous feasts purchased from the deli or local bakeries. BUT! Every Thanksgiving and Christmas he soaked a bag of gigantic Lima beans. Then he painstakingly cooked and stirred and spiced and annotated a huge cast iron pot of those limas. When the concoction was mysteriously perfect, this gargantuan pot was shakily hoisted into the oven to bake for what seems hours. \"Get outta the way!\" he would yell, \"I gotta get this thing in the oven!\" My first Christmas at his house, I mistakenly wondered why there was such a reverence for this cooking endeavor with a bunch of dried Lima beans. The pot of limas took preference in the oven to all other dishes. Even the turkey AND THE HAM!!! Oh. my . Word.\n\nWell, the limas turned out to be barbecued. And they were to die for. Absolutely totally unbelievable flavors and textures. The whole house smelled divine when they were cooking. They tasted slightly different every year. Always better as each year passed. It could also have been that with each passing year, I grew to love my father-in-law more and more and more.\n\nBut, there was no recipe, so when my beloved father-in-law passed away suddenly one Easter, when the winter holidays rolled around that year, we recognized another loss in a tradition that was woven into our family in the holidays. There would be no feasting on barbecued beans. No wrapped dishes of it for the long ride home. No scrawled recipe to cherish.\n\nSo, we were determined to recreate the recipe. We found giant limas at the local store. Back in the dark corner in a dusty plastic bag. We soaked and soaked, but no amount of ministering to them turned them into the plump, melt in your mouth limas we craved. Finally, after several years of searching, I finally ran across these limas on Amazon. And they are perfect. Creamy. Hold their shape, but are tender when cooked. Delectable flavor. Eureka!\n\nSo, every holiday dinner, we tweak a recipe we developed. A bit more tomato sauce here. A splash more cider vinegar there. Brown sugar, spices, a dollop of love. Our recipe keeps getting better every year. Another year to ring in the holidays by clanging the cast iron lid on our cast iron pot and yell \"get outta the way! I gotta get this thing in the oven!\"\n\nSo, here we are again! Thanksgiving is next week and I am ordering my Lima beans for the holidays! These are the best limas. Whether barbecued, or splashed with cream or swimming in butter. We haven't found a Lima bean as tasty in all the years we searched for them. We love them and they help us to remember a special person whom we loved fiercely!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTropicana Orange Juice, 10 Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\n A REVIEW FROM MRS. L.\n\n\nThis purchase was a real trip down memory lane! My husband confessed a few weeks ago that he missed drinking Tropicana orange juice. The orange juice of childhood. He didn't like drinking kale-organic beet root-orange-lemon-banana juice, lovingly made in my very expensive juicer.\n\nWHAT????? Is this a breakfast juice uprising? Juiced beet roots last stand?\n\nDid \"they\" still make Tropicana?  \"They\" do and it's available in all its glory here on Amazon. I thought the price was very inexpensive and the convenience of having already prepared 10 oz servings was very nice.\n\nI had forgotten how much I liked the taste of Tropicana. It has a sweet, but not too sweet taste. But, it also has a tart, but not too tart taste. I detect just the slightest tiny whiff of something like orange zest taste, which adds to the body of the flavor. It has a sweet, non acidic aftertaste which is pleasant and satisfying.\n\nWe first tried the juice straight out of the case and we both agreed we had made a great decision in ordering it. That evening, we put several bottles of Tropicana in the refrigerator to chill overnight. Chilling the juice made it just absolutely refreshing and delicious. The flavor kind of dances in your mouth\n\nI read some of the other reviews about mold growing and such. Each bottle states that the product is pasteurized. The bottles are clear plastic, so any contamination or spoilage is very likely to be visible if there are concerns.\n\nAlso, this product is remarkably low in sodium. Only 20 mg per serving. It's a wonderful source of potassium, 560 mg. Provides 100% of vitamin C and has 15% of the daily recommended folic acid.\n\nSo, for us, we were very, very pleased with this purchase. Delicious, refreshing, inexpensive, convenient, nutritious. Oh, and cute little bottles. ;-)\n\n\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['flavor', 'sodium', 'delicious', 'like', 'sweet', 'one', 'review', 'taste', 'food', 'low']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy - Energizes and Supports Focus - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\nA few times a week at work, I'll drink diet soda in the afternoon as a pick-me-up.  I know soda isn't very healthy for you, so I've also tried a few different flavors of hot tea.  Unfortunately for me, a lot of teas are caffeine free.  And those that do have caffeine are typically of a low dose.\n\nTherefore, I was eager to try Yogi Perfect Energy Vanilla Spice tea.  The Oregon-based company advertises the product as a natural energizer, without the jitters.  Each tea bag contains 80 mg of caffeine, which is about the same as an 8 ounce cup of coffee.  One of the first things I noticed is that each tea bag has a large amount of ingredients.  There are 14 different herbs listed, including Organic Cinnamon Bark, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Stevia leaf.  It also contains natural vanilla flavor, Organic Chai Spice Flavor, and Vanilla Bean.\n\nYou are instructed to use 8 oz of water and steep the bag for 4-6 minutes (longer than a typical tea bag).  Simply put, this is a great tasting tea.  I especially think it's good for people who are not used to drinking normal tea, since the Stevia leaf adds natural sweet flavor.  You don't need to waste calories by adding in your own sugar.  So in terms of taste, I would give it 5 stars.  In terms of energy boost, I would give it 4 stars.  It did not give me as much of an alertness boost as coffee does, but there was definitely a noticeable pick-me-up.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great product for those that like mildly sweet vanilla flavor, or for those that need more caffeine from their tea bag.  I will definitely be ordering these for my office.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Texture is nice, too. Not gritty like some cookies I've had in the past. I wish it was crispy like it says in the description. They were soft and crumbled. I could blame it on California weather but it wasn't that hot today (85 degrees maybe). Any way, the chocolate was completely melted and reformed.\nThe ginger cookie is not particularly strong in ginger or spice flavor. The cookie to chocolate ratio is chocolate heavy. What makes it so palatable is probably all the super sweet chocolate they use to cover up the slightly bland ginger cookie underneath. There are 8 cookies per box and four boxes per pack, if you buy them from Amazon. Tip for those who want to try these, order them on a chilly day or you'll get a box of crumbly goo like I did.\nI gave these three stars because I think they have the potential to be good. And for how limited gluten free cookies and bread options are out there, this is not bad at all. Could have been a lot worse.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\n Ghirardelli Chocolate Intense Dark Bar, Midnight Reverie 86% Cacao Bar, 3.17-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nThese 86% cacao squares are delicious, smooth, and creamy even for such high percentage of cacao. They are intense and are a bit more bitter than sweet. Perfect for those who don't like their sweets too sweet. Perfect for those who want the intense chocolate flavor. Perfect for people like me with absolutely no self-control when it comes to chocolate. The sweet to bitter to chocolate ratio satisfies my cravings. But it's not too sweet to tempt me to eat more than one or two squares at a time. I find the 60% and 72% way too addicting!!! That is why I steer clear of those and only stock the 86% in my desk :)\n\nI also like that they are individually wrapped. Keeps the chocolate fresh. And keeps me from eating more than I should. When I buy chocolate bars, I find myself breaking off bits here and there and ultimately eating WAY too much.\n\nOne square is 60 calories. Only 3 Weight Watchers points. I'd much rather eat one square of this than the overpriced fake diet sweets that Weight Watchers sells. This is something delicious that I can splurge on that is also good for me, as I read that it is good to have 1 oz. of dark chocolate (70% cacao or higher) a day. Thank you to whomever did the research to justify that I can have chocolate every day!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNature's Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil- Pure, Cold-pressed, Organic, Non-GMO, Gluten-free- 16 Ounce\nReview:\nYou can eat it, cook with it, and put it on your body. I've tried eating it. It's like eating coconut flavored oil. Not too bad...I didn't stick to my regimen so didn't fully experience the health benefits but if you go online and read about it...there are supposed to be many.\n\nI cooked with it and it's a nice oil to cook with. But everything comes out slightly coconutty. Not a problem if you like that flavor, but it doesn't \"go\" with everything.\n\nI used to use it as a cuticle oil as well which worked wonderfully. I would apply to lips as a natural lip balm. Then when I licked it off, I felt it was natural and good for me.\n\nRecently my friends and I have been applying this to our infants skin to sooth and relieve eczema. We read somewhere that this would work but didn't believe it. But then we were desperate because we tried everything else. And this was AMAZING! cleared up baby eczema, so wholesome, gentle and hydrating. Baby smells and tastes great.

This pops great and has very few unpopped kernels, so in that aspect they're about even. But the taste is way different. The Jolly Time doesn't taste as good and it is way too salty for kettle corn flavor. It's like they took normal salted butter corn and sprinkled some splenda into it. Half way through, I was on salt overload. Texture wise, the Jolly Time is not as fluffly either. So there is less fluffy white and more hard bits.\n\nI'm sure if you have never eaten microwave popcorn before, then this would be quite acceptable. But in comparison to other brands, it lacks. This was definitely a disappointing purchase that I will have to slowly eat...for many many many months. Since there is a plethera of selection out there, I doubt I would buy Jolly Time again.\n\nAlso, it took Amazon 10 days from date of purchase to get it to my door. What is up with that?\n\nI think this product deserves 3 stars but I'm going to give it 2 because of the slow shipping and because the average rating should come down a bit. 4.5 stars is too misleading.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nOreo Mega Stuf Chocolate Sandwich Cookies, 13.2 Ounce\nReview:\nI thought I was in heaven when I ate the first cookie. So much sweet creamy center goodness. After three cookies, I was over the sweet creamy center goodness. I was on Oreo center overload. Plus I kept visualizing my arteries clogging up.\n\nI eventually ate the rest of the box...but I took out most of the centers and threw them away. I know that is wasteful but I just couldn't eat any more cream.\n\nI do personally know some people who really like these. And they say they prefer these un-dunked and the originals dunked. I guess all that extra cream makes it so you don't have to dunk it in a glass of milk.\n\nFor me, I'd say that if I was only going to eat one cookie and one cookie only, I would go for the mega stuff. If I wanted more than one cookie, then I prefer the cookie to cream ratio of the originals.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nWholesome Sweeteners Organic Fair Trade Honey, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nOrganic, fair-trade, delicious honey. According to the description, this honey comes from the jungles of South America. That might explain the flavor and the color of the honey. It is very dark, like the color of a dark ale. Much darker than the picture. The flavor is mild with a hint of tartness and no real identifiable notes of any particular flavor. So if you like clover, orange flower, or other specially flavored honeys, this is might not be for you.\n\nWhat I really like about this honey is the packaging. Particularly the spout. The opening where the honey squeezes out has a silicon nipple. When you stop squeezing the nipple cuts off the flow of honey. There are no drips. The bottle stays clean. You can actually store the bottle cap down without finding crusty dried build-up from slow leaks. A small little tweak to packaging makes such a big difference. So clean!!!\n\nLove the bottle. Satisfied with the honey. Would recommend to others.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKellogg's Special K Protein Meal Bars, Strawberry, 6 Count Box (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI buy these as late afternoon snacks for my husband.

Also 1 bar is 7 WW points or 170 calories for 12 grams of protein and 15 grams of sugar. Not worth it for me or my diet but you be the judge. I do like the price and like auto-delivery on Amazon.

If you're used to eating JIF or Skippy, this will be a different experience. First off, when you first open a jar, you'll have to stir it a little. I find that I only stir it one upon opening, and I don't have to stir it again... until I pop open a new jar. This peanut butter is smooth, creamy, perfectly sweet, and totally delicious. You can really taste the honey!!! And the peanut flavor is so fresh. I made a sandwich for my fiance who has been using Skippy for years. He said that you can't really compare the two. It's like comparing McDonalds to gourmet food. But this tastes more natural and somehow... healthier. I'm doing to keep using this. Maybe I'll bake with it some day. For now, I'm happy to eat it from the jar or if I'm feeling \"fancy\" I'll make a PB&J sandwich.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPamela's Products Gluten Free Baking &amp; Pancake Mix, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nOMG.

The best GF baking/pancake mix is now available in bulk on Amazon and on Amazon's Subscribe and Save Program.\n\nI've been buying and eating Pamela's mix for the last 5 years. Usually to make pancakes for my family and me on Sundays. But I have tried the recipes online. Several quick cakes (zuchinni bread, banana nut, carrot...) all came out excellent.\n\nWould recommend with one caveat...it is not dairy free for those who are lactose intolerant. And if you have gluten cross sensitivity with similar type proteins from other sources, you might want to look into that before buying 25 lbs of this stuff.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPamela's Products Gluten Free Baking &amp; Pancake Mix, 24-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI have to admit that this is a very easy to use gluten free baking mix and the pancakes that it makes are absolutely stellar. This mix is also great because it can make more than just pancakes. There are plenty of recipes online to try such as: loaf breads,yeast breads, bread sticks, cakes, scones, cookies, biscuits, pie crusts, and pizza crusts-- all with just one baking mix.\nI bought this not because I bake a lot... but because every once in a while, I do want to have pancakes for breakfast or the occasional cookie treat. And prior to using this mix, I used another really excellent gluten free pancake mix called \"Sweet Cake Bake Shop Gluten Free Pancake Mix\" which you can also get from Amazon. I switched because it was pricey and you get a lot more for your money buying Pamela's. However, I didn't realize that Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is mix is NOT LACTOSE FREE!!!\nI am both gluten and lactose intolerant and this product gives me stomachaches. The \"Sweet Cake Bake Shop\" mix was both gluten free and lactose free. When I made pancakes with that mix, it called for \"milk of your choice\" and I was able to make great pancakes using Lactaid (lactose free milk), soy milk or almond milk. Pamela's pancake recipe calls for water because there is already milk in the mix. And thus, you don't get to choose what kind of milk to use.\nSince I already purchased it, I'll finish the three bags I have by making holiday cookies and such for my family and friends who are not lactose intolerant. As for myself, I will not purchase this product again. And I will probably have to go back to the \"Sweet Cake Bake Shop Gluten Free Pancake Mix\" or keep looking for something that meets my gluten free, lactose free, and low price criteria.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'flavor', 'free', 'eat', 'amazon', 'chocolate', 'mix', 'sweet', 'time', 'get']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nGustaf's Dutch Licorice, Double Salt, 7-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI wanted to try some Salmiack so I bought a bag of the fish , a bag of the cats, \"Katjes-Kinder\" is printed on the red packaging they came in and these double salt disks.\nThe double salt is strong....STRONG... but it IS delicious though eating more than two or three back to back may not be the best course of action .They are A little too soft however and for that reason im going to see if I can find Double Salt Salmiack with the 'toughness' of the cats.

It was a top pick in the cookbook which is why I started buying it and I agree.  Also makes decent salsa in the winter if you really let the tomatos drain. (Another test kitchen tip).  They are canned within hours of being picked and the cannery is next to the fields so are super ripe when picked.  It shows in the flavor.  I just read on the Muir Glenn site they are moving to BPA free liners beginning the harvest of 2011?  There is no date on the News Article so maybe it was 2010.

It worked so now I am splurging ($22.93) on the buttermilk.  I keep buttermilk on hand in the fridge but fresh milk prices are always rising and I like not worrying about inventory.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nGolden Malted All Natural Waffle &amp; Pancake Mix, 33-Ounce Containers (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI doctored it by adding more malt powder and came closer to achieving the magic of the original version but it's still not that instant just-right of taste and texture.  I also used buttermilk ignoring the new recipe instructions on the canister which differ from the original canister which specified buttermilk.\n\nI am going to have to dig out the powdered buttermilk from my stores because I strongly suspect that the disappointing difference from the original of a few years ago is a reduction in percentages of the other ingredients relative to the flour.  I suspect this because in the intervening years, I have followed the America Test Kitchen recipe which IS perfect but I wanted to get the Carbon premix for my mother who is very picky and liked the Carbon but not the homemade ATK version.  Sadly, this batch was a disappointment and now I am afraid to purchase the original version in case they have changed the percentages as well.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\n PG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 240-Count Box (Pack of 2) \nReview:\nExcellent.

It's missing the baking powder and coca powder ingredients from the Hershey's Best Brownies recipe.\n\nSaturated Fats\nAll fats are composed mainly of triglycerides. These, in turn, are composed of \"fatty acids.\" These fatty acids fall into three categories: saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. Of these three, saturated fatty acids are the main culprit in raising blood cholesterol.\n\nFoods high in saturated fat come from both animals and plants. Animal-based foods containing lots of saturated fat include butter, beef tallow, lard and poultry fat. Seafood contains a small amount. Plant-based oils containing saturated fat include coconut oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil and cocoa butter.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nPacific Foods Organic Spicy Black Bean Soup, 32-Ounce Cartons, 12-Pack\nReview:\nThis soup was kind of watery and I kept thinking it was waiting for something additional - maybe rice or corn or something.

It reminds me of the rice you get in Mexican restaurants so maybe this could be served on the side with a Mexican style entree.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nMallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nSo this shelf stable adaptation of smores is worth a sample and definitely worth introducing to foreign students for a taste of Americana.  Oreos travel well but there's something about Mallomars specifically;\n\na delicate dark chocolate shell - not too cloying, sweet but so thin as to be acceptable\n\na pllow of some kind of marshmallow representation\n\nbut the best part that pulls it together is  a nondry but crumbly cookie that has you doing your best to catch every crumb when you bite into it.\n\nmallomars are a strangely inhaleable Interesting eating experience.  It's too sweet but so light and effortless that you end up eating more than you intended.

I made the mistake of using too much tea for my first pot but this is a tasty tea.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa, 26 Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThankfully, this is prerinsed because the quinoa was too small for my strainer.  I steamed the quinoa the same way I steam rice i.e. in a pyrex bowl with boiling water covering it.  It was ready in no time.  It tasted fine until I added some salt and a spoonful of olive oil.  Even without other fixings, this product tasted fantastic.  It is definitely suitable as a rice substitute.  I had been eating steamed oatmeal for a week and gotten sick of it so this quinoa has turned out to be a great purchase.\n\nIt took me a long time to purchase quinoa although I had seen it prepared many times on cooking shows because I couldn't tell quinoa from bulgur and couscous.  I will probably not bother with couscous because it is a wheat and is less nutritious than quinoa. I am trying to be efficient in preparing nutritious meals more than I am trying to expand my horizons.

I can dunk and wait for the last drops to fall before taking a bite and I don't get the end of it falling off and plunking into my coffee to become a sodden mess.

I don't have a sweet tooth, so I like that the KIND granola bars aren't overly sweet. They're still loaded with sugars (cane sugar as second ingredient, tapioca syrup as third, some brown rice syrup towards the end), with 6g of added sugars for a 150 calories snack; I wish they would `tone` the sugar down. I also like the idea of multiple grains, but in the end the bar is mainly oats with some millet and amaranth... and the quinoa is listed after sea salt (so I assume is less than a pinch).\n\nGranola bars aren't a filling snack for me (I almost get a sugar rush and become more hungry in ~1 hour), these make no exception; but again, if I need the extra energy and sugar for a long hike, I'll take them with me.\n\nThe granola bars are somewhat chewy, but they still got some crunch and dryness (but they are not too dry). They make good on the go snacks, since they won't squish or crumble in a backpack or back; they aren't very sticky so you won't need to wipe your fingers after enjoying them.\n\n-> `Oats & Honey with Toasted Coconut` has a nice mild honey flavor and some coconut flakes inside; the coconut flavor was too mild to tell if the coconut was toasted.\n-> `Maple Pumpkin Seeds with Sea Salt` has whole roasted (yummy) pumpkin seeds inside and a nice mild maple flavor (and smell). The bar is quite sweet (but not in a sickening way), I didn't noticed any saltiness.\n-> `Double Dark Chocolate` contains a few nice tasting milky (not dark) chocolate chips, but it's not bursting with chocolate flavor. It barely tastes like single-chocolate, nothing double flavored, but still is a somewhat enjoyable bar.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKIND Bars, Dark Chocolate Nuts &amp; Sea Salt, Gluten Free, 1.4 Ounce Bars, 12 Count\nReview:\nI find it hard to 'commit' to a 12 single flavor of KIND bars, so I like this variety pack option which gives some variety. KIND bars are nice tasting, but not my go-to snack; the ingredients are great, simple, clean, but for me it's not a filling snack for the ~200 calories. I would like best to find the mini bar packs on Amazon at a decent price; I rarely even find them in physical stores.\nLike most nut bars the bars are sticky. I don't consider KIND bars good on the go bars; the honey and chocolate coatings melt easily.\nThe nuts in the bars are good quality and seem quite fresh, but don't pack tons of flavor. The bars I received in December 2017 expire in November 2018. With most nut bars the issue is that depending on expiration date and storing conditions prior to purchase, you can get hit or miss (e.g. stale tasting nut bars), no matter if you purchase from Amazon or the store.\nI like that they list the nuts in the order of predominance in the bar, so you can choose your favorite type of nuts.\nAll flavors in the variety pack tasted good. I enjoy they are not very sweet. The 'spices' (cinnamon, maple) are quite mild, would preferred a stronger flavor.\n\nThe box was delivered in decent condition, in a plastic bag; the box was slightly dented (since the bag probably didn't protect it from careless delivery), but the bars were in perfect shape.\n\nIndividual bar review:\nDark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt - This bar has a rich dark chocolate drizzle and bottom coating; I love it's not a sweet bar, so I can enjoy the dark chocolate and the delicious combination with sea salt. The peanuts are predominant in this bar as flavor, although almonds are listed first.\nDark Chocolate Cinnamon Pecan - This bar has a rich dark chocolate drizzle and bottom coating; I love it's not a sweet bar, so I can enjoy the dark chocolate. The cinnamon flavor is mild, barely noticeable. I liked that the pecan content is high, and I could taste them over the almonds and peanuts.\nMaple Glazed Pecan & Sea Salt - This is mostly an almonds bar, with some peanuts and pecans. Again, not very sweet, and the sea salt is nice addition to the flavor. The maple syrup flavor is mild.\n\nOther flavors I tried:\nKind Plus Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew - I really enjoyed the abundance of cherries and cashews, but I could also taste the raisins. The chocolate bottom melts very easily, this bar needs to be stored in a cool place; the chocolate is not the best tasting. I didn't like how sweet this bar is, the ingredient lists contains dry fruits, sugar, glucose syrup... more sweeteners than needed.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHEALTH WARRIOR Chia Bars, Acai Berry, Gluten Free, Vegan, 25g bars, 15 Count\nReview:\nThe Health Warrior Chia Bar is a chewy (but compact) and seedy bar; it's not sticky at all, so it's great on the go (although it might soften more on warmer climates). Since it contains chia seeds, it's has an odd texture to eat and will stick to teeth, but I personally enjoyed the bars nonetheless since I'm a chia fan; I mention this since some people might dislike this `seedy` texture.\nThe flavors are really nice, I find that Health Warrior overall has great tasting bars/snacks. Some varieties have a toned-down, mild flavor, but they're still enjoyable. Most `dark chocolate` based flavors actually taste like milk chocolate, they don't have the bitter richness of dark chocolate. I do find that same flavors tend to vary a lot in taste from bar to bar (even bars in the same box).\nAnother thing I like a lot is that the brand offers variety packs (Chocolate, Breakfast and Tropical variety) so one can't get bored with one flavor; still, I would love even more a variety pack with all flavors.\nThe bars are incredibly tiny; it can barely be a snack, I just can't see how people eat this as breakfast and stay full until lunch. The chia seeds will expand in the stomach so it's kind of filling, but even as a snack I need to have the bar with an apple or some carrots or celery sticks,\nFor a `healthy` snack bar this has an incredible amount of added sugars, from multiple sources (brown rices syrup - twice on the list, agave syrup). It might seem little at 4g of sugars per bar, but it's a tiny bar and it's just added sugar; it would have made more sense to use dates (or other dry fruits) if they wanted to add sweetness. The other ingredients are OK, pretty much natural and without any odd fillers.\n\nFlavors review:\n-> `Vanilla Almond`: I'm a fan of both vanilla and almond, and I found this bar great tasting. Most snack bars with `vanilla almond` flavor tend to have an artificial taste; not this one, the vanilla flavor was very enjoyable, almost natural. There were some bits of almonds inside, but very few.\n-> 'Dark Chocolate`: While the chocolate flavor was enjoyable, it leaned more towards milk chocolate than dark chocolate in my opinion. There are tiny chocolate chips inside. The cocoa liquor intensifies the flavor, giving it an unique touch.\n-> `Chocolate Peanut Butter`: The sample bar I tried of this flavor was an enjoyable treat, with dark chocolate chips inside and a hint of peanut butter; the chips have a surprisingly great quality dark chocolate taste, but I wished a little more peanut flavor. The bars that came in the `Chocolate Lovers` variety pack had a totally different taste, barely any peanut butter flavor, less chocolate chips and a mild vanilla almost coconut flavor.\n-> `Dark Chocolate Cherry`: With tiny bits of sour dried cherries and sweet chocolate chips (I simply don't feel any dark chocolate vibes, it's sweet milk chocolate to my taste buts), this variety is a nice treat. But I noticed the `flavorness` varying a lot between bars, from bursting with cherry flavor to simply tasting like the `Dark Chocolate` one. The ratio of chips and cherry pieces also varies a lot from bar to bar.\n-> `Caramel Sea Salt`: This bar tastes mostly like caramel, with the specific bitterness. It didn't have enough coconut flavor for my liking, but I loved the mix of sweet and salty (it's very well balanced).\n-> Coconut: This bar has a nice coconut flavor, but quite mild and with a hint of bitterness (not necessary in a bad way, but in a coconut extract way). There are some coconut flakes inside, which add up to the seedy texture of chia. It's one of the sweetest flavors, a little too sweet for my liking. But the bar smells wonderfully of coconut.\n-> `Mango`: This bar has quite a nice fruity mango flavor, not too artificial. There were quite a few dried mango pieces inside, making the bar even more enjoyable.\n-> `Apple Cinnamon`: This bar tastes just like applesauce mixed with cinnamon, a quite natural flavor, but also mild (it might be affected by the fact that the bar delivered by Amazon was passed the best by date).\n-> `Banana Nut`: This delicious bar taste exactly like a banana nut muffin, although I couldn't identify any dried banana pieces inside. But it was strangely very greasy compared to the other flavors.\n-> `Acai Berry`: There are more cranberries (actual dry bits in the bar) and strawberries (powder) in this bar than acai, but the berry flavor is very toned down, without the specific tartness.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nOrganic, Gluten Free Spicy Avocado Hummus, 8 oz\nReview:\nThis is a nice tasting hummus, but it's definitely too spicy and peppery for my taste. The texture is creamy, but you can feel the avocado pieces inside. Since it's so spicy, I could only eat it with crackers and bland wraps... for my taste it doesn't work in combination with raw veggies and deli meats.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNavitas Organics Cacao Nibs, 8 oz. Bag &mdash; Organic, Non-GMO, Fair Trade, Gluten-Free\nReview:\nAs a dark chocolate lover (I actually dislike milky sweet chocolate), these cacao nibs are a nice treat. The nibs feel like crunching something in between coffee beans and chocolate pieces. Since these are pure cacao beans, they have the winey fermented smell and taste that some might not enjoy; as another reviewer mentioned, these are an acquired taste.\nI add these nibs to my oatmeal or yogurt, and the thing I like is that they don't melt; so I can enjoy them whole even with my overnight oats. The nibs are too small for my licking in snacks.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nManitoba Harvest Hemp Hearts Raw Shelled Hemp Seeds, 2oz (Pack of 12); with 10g Protein &amp; Omegas per Serving, Non-GMO, Gluten Free\nReview:\nGreat quality hemp product, as everything I have tried from Manitoba Harvest! I love both the flavor and the texture. I add the raw shelled hemp seeds to salads, smoothies, oats, yogurt, baked products. It adds something special to muffins or bread while baking, I really recommend trying to add hemp to baking.\nNutritionally, they are a great way to add fats to my macros (better than chia in terms of fat vs. carbs). I don't use a full 30g serving, for me 10g are enough. Did not noticed any strange side effects.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeanut Butter &amp; Co. Vanilla Peanut Powder, Non-GMO Project Verified, Gluten Free, Vegan, 6.5 oz Jar\nReview:\nI like peanut butter powder as it's so easy to add in baked goods, pancakes, waffles or oatmeal, or to mix with soy sauce for a `Thai` experience. I don't like opening and storing for months jar of peanut butter, I prefer for convenience the powdered form (which is also easier to portion control).\nThis Mighty Nut product yields a pretty nice `peanut butter` spread with water, good on toast or celery sticks. 2TBSP powder and 1TBSP water yields a more thick consistency, which I personally prefer. The peanut butter flavor is easily overpowered by other ingredients in oatmeal or baking goods. I also add it sometimes into yogurt, mixes well.\nBut by comparison, I prefer the PB2 flavor; it's more peanuty and stronger. Peanut butter powder is not as tasty as real peanut powder, either way.\n\nI tried both the `Original` and the `Vanilla` flavor, and I did find the `Vanilla` one to have a stronger/better peanut butter taste (while being a little more sweet). The vanilla flavor was there, but not very strong.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPUR Gum, Spearmint, 55 pieces - Aspartame Free, Sugar Free, 100% Xylitol, Natural Chewing Gum, Non GMO, Vegan\nReview:\nThe PUR gum is one of the best options on the market that I have tried for aspartame free gum. I like that the gum is regular size, some other aspartame free gums are tiny; for me, just one piece is enough. The ingredient list is actually surprisingly simple and clean, especially comparing it to regular gum.\n\nThe peppermint flavor is somewhat mild minty, but still refreshing and cooling. The taste is not as long lasting as regular gum, but still persists for the 20-30 minutes I usually chew gum after a meal. The gum is not sweet, which I also appreciate (I hate to chew sweet stuff after a meal).\nThe gum doesn't fell apart when chewing, but it's not very rubbery/gummy either. In time I got so used with the PUR gums, I actually started to dislike `regular` gum.\n\nI do like the resealable bags options; cuts the cost per gum (especially when price drops under $4 on Amazon) and also the wasteful packaging. I keep a bag at my desk and a 9 piece package on the go. I actually find that the peppermint flavor is better for the resealable bag, compared with the 9 piece package.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSweetLeaf Sweet Drops Liquid Stevia Sweetener, English Toffee, 2 Ounce\nReview:\nI mostly use just Stevia as sweetener when needed (althought I'm not the biggest fan of sweets) and the idea of flavored Stevia Drops seemed great.\nThe English Toffee flavor tastes just like most caramel artificial flavors (not very close to toffee), but it's a nice flavor. The taste reminds me of caramel flavoured yogurts or coffee syrups; if I don't combine it with other flavors it also has a hint of liquor taste. The flavor is mild, but enjoyable, definetely not too sweet. If I try to use more drops (to get a stronger flavor) I can feel a very bitter odd taste (common to Stevia).\nI find that the SweetLeaf Sweet Drops work better with yogurt, smoothies, oatmeal (cooked or overnight), baked products, pancakes. I mostly use this flavor in plain yogurt, plain applesauce, when I add shredded apples or applesauce to oatmeal, pancakes or baked items. I don't enjoy it in water (but I usually don't drunk flavoured water). I just hate the taste of Stevia in coffee (and I love my coffee black unsweetened); the drops add a nice caramel flavor, but also the odd bitter Stevia taste some might be familiar with. Another mention is that I find that high temperatures (from baking, making pancakes, cooking oarmeal) make the flavor more mild; it's definetely more potent when it's fresh.\nThe dropper bottle is indeed very convenient and easy to use; once you experiment with the drop count you can get the perfect dosage to your taste. The 5 drops as serving is not a magic number, it depends on the product your are adding it too. For me 5 drops works for a 5.3oz yogurt, but I'll use more like 7-10 drops in oatmeal (45-48g of dry oats serving). But it's still cost efficient, I'll never use more than 10 drops per serving.\nThe sweetener dissolved fast in any product I have used.\nI would personally recommend people just to try this product and different flavors. The flavor and usage can be very subjective.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nDave's Killer Bread, 21 Whole Grains Thin-Sliced 60 Calories, Organic, 20.5 oz\nReview:\nThis is a good tasting bread (maybe a little too sweet for my taste), with good ingredients. The slices are rather thin (that's why they are 60 calories), but this is a perfect size and calorie content for my diet. Also, makes perfect sized sandwiches.\nI prefer to eat this bread as it is and top it with anything I like, as I found it burns quite fast while toasting. The texture is nice, but it's a firmer bread, not a soft one. I really enjoy the seeds.\nThe bread dries out quite easily, so I'll warm the slices a little. Topped with a little butter... pure awesomeness!\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['flavor', 'good', 'great', 'taste', 'quality', 'fresh', 'nice', 'like', 'also', 'quite']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nHerdez Salsa Casera, 7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nI like making my own salsa, but occasionally, I heat this briefly in the microwave right in the Pyrex serving dish, and we're good to go without a lot of fuss.

From a nutrition stand point, the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain, unsalted nut this is pretty typical.  I like to keep a can of these either in my desk or in the pantry at home for snacking.  Grabbing a handful of these is great between meals when hunger strikes.

It's packed with a variety of healthy grains in addition to the gluten free oats.  It's a healthier granola.  The only downfall is the lack of blueberries in the granola. When a granola is labeled vanilla blueberry clusters, I tend to look for blueberries or at least a noticeable blueberry flavor. (The lack of blueberry is the reason for the 4 star instead of 5 star review.)\n\nThe Cinnamon granola had a very nice cinnamon flavor. The granola tasted great with milk as well as eating plain as a snack.\n\nIt would be nice if the granola came in larger packages as we went through the granola very quickly. If you use it on top of yogurt or ice cream, it will last much longer.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

And they are lower in fat and lower in calories than most candy bars. If you need a candy bar or an energy bar then try these Zone bars instead. Besides they taste as good as any candy bar I've ever had. For a supposed nutrition bar, these are really delicious. They taste so good that I repeatedly compared the ingredients, fat content and calories to a number of candy bars and other nutrition bars and these Zone bars are definitely healthier than any candy bar and better than 90% of the other nutrition bars.\n\nI agree with the one review about the chocolate melting easily but when we go boating or on a picnic, we just put these in the cooler. I've tried all the varieties and like the dark chocolate and the chocolate almond the best.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It has much to recommend it:  it heats well, has a pronounced tomato flavor, and, while fairly thick, is still easy to drink because it lacks bits of vegetable or pasta that might cling to the bottom of the cup.  My only real complaint with this flavor (besides the high sodium content, endemic to so many Campbell's soups) is that the \"dairy\" or cream notes are very slight.  This soup is about as thick as cream-of-tomato from the classic red-and-white steel can reconstituted with milk -- but it tastes much more like that same soup reconstituted with water only.  Even so, of the several kinds of Soup on the Go I've tried, this is my favorite.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nEight O'Clock Whole Bean Coffee, The Original, 36 Ounce\nReview:\nA good, competent, cuppa joe kind of coffee.

However, the caramels themselves are the same -- sweet, rather soft, chewy (watch that dental work!), and individually wrapped, with a pronounced milk undertone.  Also suitable for making caramel apples in the fall.  The quoted price here for this size at this time is wholly unrealistic; try the eleven-ounce bag's price instead.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHarmony House Foods Soup Mix, Dried Vegetable, 12 Ounce Quart Size Jar\nReview:\nI realize that this jar of Harmony House Dried Vegetable Soup Mix is a bit of an \"investment\" for a two-person household like ours, but the investment really paid off for us.  Example:  add about a third of a cup of these flakes to the kind of soup mix that makes half a gallon (we like Cugino's \"Chicken Noodle Knockout,\" which ordinarily calls for just cooked chicken and water),  add about an extra 3/4 cup of water to the soup than the recipe calls for, and double the cook time from 20 to 40 mins. (an hour is even better if you have the time).  You don't have to boil the stock furiously, the gentlest simmer will do.  Here's the fun part:  It needs no tweaking.  None.  The result is a thoroughly healthy, hearty chicken noodle soup you (and any guests) will find hard to distinguish from homemade.  Garnish with black pepper (optional) and don't forget the crackers!  It's a meal in itself.

Therefore, it usually has to be ordered by the box and will cost more than a dollar per unit (1.75 ounce bar).  Peanut-butter-flavor is the heart of the bar, not unlike a Butterfinger or the kind of peanut butter logs that have been delighting trick-or-treaters for years.  Outside, though, is not chocolate or more peanut flavoring, but fried coconut!  Can this be good for us?  I doubt it.  Is it delicious?  It sure is.  My shipment was fresh, well packaged, and arrived intact.  I won't downrate the Zagnut bar because we all know candy bars are not that good for us, but this one really brings back memories and I'm glad I indulged.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['good', 'soup', 'like', 'flavor', 'price', 'one', 'little', 'much', 'chocolate', 'bag']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nLuzianne Iced Tea Bags, 12 Count (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nYou can't get better tea than Luzianne.  Tetley, Lipton, Rose Red, etc. don't even compare.  I love the delicious Orange Pekoe/Black Tea blend because it is the perfect combination of fruity and roast flavor.  My family has been buying Luzianne for years.  I just bought a 48 pack of family size tea bags at Walmart tonight and I love how large they are.  I've been drinking almost nothing but tea and water for about a week now because I am trying to wean myself of soda.  It has the perfect amount of caffeine to not cause headaches and it is really good for you -- if you don't sweeten it.  Tea has been shown to prevent cancer and diabetes!  Brew some Luzianne and you'll never look back!\n\nJust a helpful tip:\n\nI have tried several different brewing methods -- stovetop boiling, microwave boiling, iced tea maker -- but the best one that works is just heating the water until it is hot (not boiling).  I've had problems with it coming out too strong and this is just right.

They're made with both mozzarella and cheddar cheese, and you can definitely taste the cheddar.  But the mozzarella gives them a milder, butterier taste than a normal cheddar cracker.  They are also not too salty, which is often a problem with cheese crackers.\n\nAt 150 calories for 25 crackers (a few handfuls), this is a great snack.  They take the edge of your hunger without filling you up with empty calories.\n\nThey are a little greasy, so you'll want to have a napkin or a sink hand when you eat them.  The crackers in my box were almost all broken, which made it a little harder to eat them.  But those are relatively minor drawbacks, and this is certainly a product that I'll eat again.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

You can use less or more tea, to taste. I love the fact that I can re-steep the same tea leaves a second time, and enjoy another pot of tea that is as delicious as the first.

First, the pecans come in a a rather flimsy plastic bag - not a container like most nuts.  I put a clip on them to keep the top of the bag shut but my dogs quickly picked up on the scent and I had to put them higher on a shelf so they wouldn't tear the bag open.

I am a full on carnivore, but several of the Vega products are a part of my regular diet now and I pass them out to friends and family who are always amazed that a vegan item is not just edible, but good.

I don't know what I was expecting, but good chocolate was a surprise. The milk chocolate is really rich and very sweet - I actually think it's a bit sweeter than a traditional Hershey bar. I couldn't eat more than a little of this at a single sitting, it's just too rich for me.\n\n Each bar is divided into four \"bites\" so you can gauge the amount of caffeine you're ingesting. You will need a Ziploc bag to keep the rest of the bar fresh after you open it. The bites are thick and taste really good, it's definitely a milk chocolate candy bar. I ate one bite piece after lunch and it was enough. I noticed a bump in energy - the combination of sugar and caffeine will do that. I won't be eating any of this chocolate as an after dinner treat, no desire to stay up all night!

The mix is simple enough, but requires more eggs and water & less oil than the Betty Crocker version. In my brownies maker these came out taller than the Betty Crocker and these have a more cake like consistency. The Betty Crocker brownies are much denser and have a richer flavor. I like both brands, but the Betty Crocker fudge brownie mix is a bit better.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBai Coconut Flavored Water, Molokai Coconut, Antioxidant Infused Drinks, 18 Fluid Ounce Bottles, 12 count\nReview:\nI was excited to try this Coconut Pineapple flavored water for a couple of reasons. First this is specifically Soy Free (I'm seriously allergic to soy) and it's all natural. Second I love pineapple and that is a naturally sweet juice, so combined with Bai's shrieks of \"no artificial sweeteners\" & the \"1 gram of sugar\" plastered all over the bottle, I was expecting an actual pineapple drink. That is not what this is. At. All.\n\nBai has added Stevia and Erythritol sugar alcohol to sweeten this drink. 16 grams of the erythritol per serving - 32 grams per bottle. For me that's enough to cause the same digestive upset that sorbitol causes - cramps, flatulence and worse. If you are sensitive to these ingredients, avoid this stuff. Additionally, this combination of stevia, erythritol and sugar has a distinct aftertaste with every swallow that reminded me and a friend of the original, blue Nyquil.\n\nBut my biggest reason for the one star rating is because nowhere on the bottle or on the Bai website is Pineapple actually listed as an ingredient in this Coconut Pineapple water with the picture of a pineapple and a coconut on the label. The bottle says \"6% Juice\".... what sort of juice? It's not pineapple juice. All the label says is filtered water, Bai proprietary sweetener blend, coconut water concentrate, natural flavors, potassium citrate, citric acid, ascorbic acid, coffeefruit extract, white tea extract, sea salt.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nREESE'S Peanut Butter Cups, Chocolate Candy, King Size (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nI ordered this multipack of Reeses Peanut Cups for Halloween and it was just right.

Why, oh why, did Good Earth have to change this tea, when it was perfectly fine and good the way it was?  I am terribly disappointed by this change, and have amended my star rating to reflect this.\n\nOriginal Review - 10/4/2010\nFirst, to the Natural/Artificial concerns - it really does say Natural Flavors in the ingredient list, NOT artificial as some of the reviews state.  Box also states \"No sugar, caffeine, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives\".  I've submitted a picture of the ingredients list to Amazon, which you can view at the top of this item page.\n\nIngredients list:\nRed Rooibos, Chicory Root, Natural Flavor, Rosehips, Cinnamon, Lemongrass, Peppermint, Papaya, Chamomile, Panax Ginseng Leaves, Anise Seed, Dandelion Root, Ginger Root, Orange Oil, Orange Peel.\n\nI was given my first box of this tea by a friend who knew I liked cinnamon tea.  Up to that point, my favorite tea was Celestial Seasonings' Bengal Spice.  But when I tried Good Earth, I fell in love!  Now I cannot find it anymore in any of the local stores that carried it, so I signed up for the regular shipments from Amazon.\n\nEveryone I have shared this tea with tell me how much they enjoy it, that it hardly seems possible for tea to have such intense flavor and not need sweetening.  I have to be sure to get some before my husband & kids finish the box without my getting a chance to have a few myself!  Seems like every time I visit my mom now, she makes up some of this for us to share as some iced tea.\n\nI do not use any sweetener, which says a lot because I use sweetener with pretty much every other kind of herbal tea I drink.  Good Earth is great hot or cold, and it sure does give my tastebuds a gingerbread-like warmth on a fall or winter morning.  There is no tea-ish, bitter taste or aftertaste.\n\nIf you love cinnamon, gingerbread, or a really good caffeine-free tea that doesn't need sweetening, give this one a try!\nRating:\n3.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

The taste is light, tastes like real fruit, and meets the desire for something cold and refreshing on occasion.\n\nWe keep these in supply for our whole family now as well, for those times when we want something a little more flavorful than plain water.\nThe price of this and other flavors of IZZE is usually quite reasonable when purchased from Prime Pantry.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLarabar Bites, Gluten Free, Double Chocolate Brownie, 5.3 oz Pouch\nReview:\nI got a selection of four flavors of Larabar Bites a while back. They are surprisingly filling little nuggets of ground dates, almonds, and chocolate. They are actually quite tasty too.\nThe cherry ones also contain ground cherries, which give them a pleasant tangy taste. Those are my favorite, but there are also coconut and mint varieties.\nThese are nice to subdue a craving for sweets or chocolate. Just a couple will do the trick.\nThere are many flavors of Larabars, but I prefer the texture and the handy snacking size of these Bites.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLarabar Bites, Gluten Free, Double Chocolate Brownie, 5.3 oz Pouch\nReview:\nI do like most Lara bars, with their simple list of ingredients and chewy taste.\nSome flavors I've liked more than others, but have never tried a chocolate one, nor any of the flavors in the form of a \"bite.\"\nI thought these were pretty good when I tried one, and then I ate several more. The taste really grew on me!\nThese will make a great snack for when I crave something sweet, and won't send me on a crash and burn expedition either.\nI look forward to exploring some of the other flavors as well.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPepperidge Farm Goldfish Crackers, Cheddar, 30 oz, Carton, 6-Count\nReview:\nIs there anyone anywhere who has not yet tasted a Goldfish cracker?\nThese tiny crackers are ubiquitous in school lunches and in mom's purses everywhere.\n\nThis particular packaging is a BIG carton for those who go through a lot of Goldfish.\nThe 30 ounce carton is bigger than a half gallon milk carton, and just as problematic to open.\nOf course the carton opening started to tear as I opened it, so I used a knife to carefully finish pulling the spout away from the carton.\nI also use a chip clip to better seal the spout, and so far the product has remained fresh and crisp.\n\nThis abundant amount of crackers is great to have on hand for distributing to little visitors in bathroom size Dixie cups.\nAnd yes, I keep a baggie of Goldfish in my purse for my granddaughter...and for me.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLu Cinnamon Sugar Spice European Biscuit Cookies, 9.17 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nLU cinnamon sugar biscuits are back!\nThese are tender-crunchy cookies that make a glass of milk worth drinking.\nDipped In coffee, they retain some crunch, but turn sandy and melty in your mouth.\n\nThe flavor and texture are unique among cookies.\nSlightly cinnamony  with a deep brown sugar taste, these cookies are almost too good to be true.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBUMBLE BEE Sensations Sun-Dried Tomato and Basil Seasoned Tuna with Crackers, High Protein Food, Gluten Free Food, High Protein Snacks, Canned Food, Bulk Snacks, 3.6 Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nWe like the Bumblebee snack packs that include both crackers and tuna salad type spreads.\nThey are convenient and filling for a light lunch or snack.\n\nThis seasoned tuna mix, however, was disappointing.\nIt was actually quite bland, with very little jalapeno flavoring, and no hot pepper bite.\nThis flavor was a complete miss for us.\n\nFor both heat and a little sweetness try the Thai Chili variety, everyone in our household prefers this over all the other flavors.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nNESTLE COFFEE-MATE Coffee Creamer, Hazelnut, liquid creamer singles, Pack of 180\nReview:\nPumpkin spice is one of my favorite flavors of non-dairy creamer.\nBecause it is available only seasonally, I was happy to be able to buy four neatly boxed containers of 50 each for a reasonable price, while the window of opportunity was still open.\n\nJust one of these little containers will flavor and sweeten a cup of coffee. Add another if you want more intense flavor.\nI add a little plain cream to my coffee along with one of these for a creamier drink.\n\nThe pumpkin spice flavor can be used in other wintery drinks as well. It is delicious in cocoa and Italian sodas.\n\nBecause these are non-dairy, they need no refrigeration and they seem to last indefinitely.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeter Pan Simply Ground Honey Roast Peanut Butter, 15 Ounce\nReview:\nThis peanut butter is the perfect union of creamy and crunchy.\nIt is similar in texture to what you get in markets where you can grind your own nut butters. However, it is actually fresher tasting than what I have found available in such markets.\nThere are no bits to get stuck in your teeth. It's all about the texture, which is hard to describe. It isn't cloying, as creamy peanut butter can sometimes be. *Grainy* doesnt seem quite the right term, because the texture has a pleasant mouth feel.\n\nThe sweetness from the honey is just sweet enough; this butter appears to be made from honey roasted peanuts rather than peanut butter with honey added.\n\nOur family loves the taste and texture of this peanut butter. I haven't seen it locally, and am hoping that Amazon continues to carry it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHonest Tea Organic Fair Trade Pomegranate Blue Gluten Free, 16.9 Fl. Oz, 12 Pack\nReview:\nAs advertised, this tea is unsweetened.\n\nI find that bottled sweetened teas are often too sweet for my taste, and sometimes I enjoy tea that is not sweetened at all.\nThis unsweetened peach tea is just ok tasting to me.\nI do like a better known brand of sweetened peach flavored tea that tastes more peachy.\n\nThis could be because when you eat a fresh peach, you want it to be sweet, so with anything peach-flavored you naturally expect a somewhat sweet and tangy taste.\n\nThe peach flavor is present in this tea, but flavor-wise, it just doesn't deliver.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nMinsley Cooked Brown Rice Bowl, 100 Percent Organic, Microwave Ready in 90 Seconds, 7.4-Ounce Bowls, Pack of 6\nReview:\nThis is just basic brown rice in convenient ready-to-eat form.\nIt is ideal for a single person, especially if you are not fond of figuring out what to do with leftover rice.\nThe cost at this time comes out to about $2.65 per bowl, but sometimes convenience outweighs cost.\n\nBe careful not to overcook the rice, all it really requires is to be thoroughly reheated.\nIf you find the rice is too dry for your taste, just add a little water--the rice will soak it right up. This will work either before or after you cook the rice.\n\nI often heat a bowl of this rice as a full meal. With cheese, leftover meat and/or cooked vegetables added, it makes a great main course.\nFor breakfast, add cinnamon sugar and milk or cream for a delicious and filling meal.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['rice', 'tea', 'little', 'flavor', 'broth', 'taste', 'sweet', 'good', 'texture', 'flavors']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nQuaker Instant Oatmeal Original, 12 Packets per Box (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is the best tasting instant oatmeal I've ever eaten.\n\nI find that most instant oatmeal products have a sticky texture and taste like glue. No so with this flavor. The raisens, dates and walnuts make a perfect combination. It tasted good even without adding milk which was a plus because I could take it to work for breakfast. It's easy to make with hot water from the microwave.\n\nI first found this flavor oatmeal at my grocery store and then was dismayed that they didn't carry it on a regular basis.

So, yes, these are veggie chips.  They also include navy beans and a bit of other vegetables like carrots. But basically, they are potato chips.\n\nThe texture is interesting - it's somewhat between a potato chip and a tortilla chip.  They have a satisfying crunch.  The coating is very savory - not just salty, but a real savory taste that didn't taste too bad at first.  However, after a handful of them, I really couldn't eat anymore.  The chips are a bit heavy as well.\n\nI didn't think these were all that bad.  I found the taste interesting - in moderation - and felt like it was something I could snack on once in a while.\n\nHowever, don't be fooled into thinking you are eating your veggies when you eat this.  Technically, I suppose you are, but you're basically buying potato chips.\n\nI would have to go 3 stars on this one.

That was pretty convenient, and it actually worked as advertised!  It wasn't even too hot to carry!\n\nOK, what about the food?\n\nTo start with I'm just a regular guy who usually makes my lunches of the previous night's family dinner left-overs...i.e., not a gourmet, but not taste-dead either...\n\nI was pleased to find that the pasta cooked well, but be advised that if you don't shake the pasta down before you cook it you might find a piece here and there that still has hard spots in it.  There was plenty of sauce...no skimping on sauce volume, and the portion size was great for lunchtime.  I wasn't stuffed when I was done, but I wasn't still hungry either.\n\nThe meat sauce was tangy and mildly spicy.  The meat sauce contained small chunks of beef (i.e., looked like hamburger), and you could tell what it was if you looked closely.  The pasta and sauce consistency was good, and I enjoyed the entire meal.  Be advised that the sauce contains onion and garlic.  If you know you have an important meeting or date later on, you will probably want to pack some mints.  Say, that would be a great addition...an after-meal mint included with each meal that you can use to fight post-meal garlic breath.\n\nIf you like the combination of convenience and pasta, this may well an excellent choice for you.\n\nIf you are also environmentally conscious, though, you should probably think twice about this unit.  Once you are done with your meal there's really not much you can do with the packaging...just recycle it.  If, however, the packaging included a solid lid rather than just the strainer lid, the main container could be washed and then reused as a food storage container...alas, that is not the case.\n\nAnyway, I thought the food was flavorful, the portion was adequate, and the convenience excellent.  Environmental challenges drop the rating by a star though.\n\nLastly, you'll have to determine whether the per unit cost makes this a good deal for you.\n\n4 stars\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

So i remember my grandma complaining that house blend coffee taste like water and asked me if I had Bustelo.  At the time I did not have any so i decided get some to give it a try.  Man this stuff is strong.  My grandma made expresso the old fashion way with a cloth strainer and wood handle, and my mom uses some stove top device. So if you like strong expresso, this will work.  I personally drink this like drip coffee (i am not an expresso fan).  If i really need to wake up I brew a cup or two of this in my coffee maker with a disposable filter.  There are times when I don't need as much caffiene so I use half bustelo and half some other coffee like Folders (my way off adding shots to regular coffee) .\n  If you are a casual coffee drinker or one who mainly drinks light brews/blondes this may be too strong for your taste buds, friends of my who drink basic light house blends don't like it.  On the other hand my friends who drink Medium roast and dark roast coffees like this brand.  and many even like the combo of adding some bustelo with another brand.  So this is a great tasting coffee if you like bold strong coffee or expresso.  Again I brew this like traditional coffee, when I need a lot of caffiene, i brew  this solely, on days when I need a little less coffee i mix it with a regular brand like foldgers.  And its a great price.

I want to be, I just have trouble with the tastelessness of water and thus fall into the trap of guzzling down sodas both for the caffeine and for the taste.  Which is a habit I'd really love to stop.  The problem with most drink additives though is the ingredients.  All those fake sugars and I figure I might as well be drinking a soda.  So then I saw True Lemon at the store and the advertisement that it was 100% natural.  So I thought why not try it?  And I'm glad I did.\n\nI started off with a little box of 10 packets of the Raspberry Lemonade to see how I would like it.  For drink additives it was pricey, but no more (and actually a little less) than if I had bought a case of the same amount of soda.  So I won't complain about the price especially considering this is better for me.  They came in little packets that were long and tubular shaped and easy to get open.  You just pop the top of your water bottle and pour the contents in, getting a little show in the meantime of the powder coming up like smoke from the bottle.  Hey, it doesn't take much to amuse me.\n\nThe taste is pretty good.  I think I taste more of the raspberry and sugar than they do the lemon, and that's why this product doesn't get more than four stars from me.  I would have liked to have had it be a bit more tart instead of just smooth and sweet.  But it's still not bad.  It goes down smooth and one packet is enough to flavor 17oz of water quite strongly.  It also turns the water a nice pale pink color.\n\nAs said before I was strongly attracted to this product because of its ingredients.  Instead of artificial sweeteners, stevia is used.  It also has lemon juice and other natural flavors.  Nothing in the ingredient list looked too bad so I'm happy.  And according to the box its only 5 calories, which isn't too bad either.\n\nDefinitely a product I'd try again, and I'll probably end up trying their other flavors as well.\n\nReview by M.

I find the flavor better than some other Cola syrups I have used in the past.  It is not too sweet though, so we add a little agave to it and sweeten it up.  Without adding sweetener the home made cola tastes a lot like \"Tab\".  (Who remembers \"Tab\"?)  I love \"Tab\"...it reminds me of my grandmother so I like the taste, but some people think it is bitter.  If you use this to make your own cola and find it kind of bitter, just add some agave or other sweetener to it and you will be fine.  The bottle is very nice and comes in a box that is perfect for gift giving.  It also comes with a handy pump to make dispensing even easier.

My mother, however LOVES it.  She has been drinking it daily for 8 days now.  While she enjoys the tea and the way it tastes (nice and sweet), she hasn't seen any weight loss benefit from it.  Granted, she doesn't really have much weight to lose but she was hoping for a pound or two.  She is going to continue to drink it because of the benefits it offers (managing blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure).  It steeps well.  She has been using my double walled infusing glass and usually lets it steep a little longer (usually about 3-5 minutes longer than the initial 8 minutes) because she likes it stronger.  It is good that you can re-use 1 tbsp up to 3 times because she drinks it before every meal (but with each use of the tea she has to steep it a little longer, obviously).  Like I said, not for me (I didn't like the taste) but she loves it.

I opened it up and oh my goodness....it smelled so wonderful that I had to get the grinder out and grind some beans.  It didn't matter that it was 3:30 pm.  It sure did help that it was 33 degrees.  But my Mother always taught me that anytime is the perfect time for coffee and she is right.  This coffee is delicious.  It smells wonderful coming out of the box and you should smell it brewing.  The aroma is intoxicating...but the flavor is even better!  Delicious and robust.  Very bold but not at all bitter.  Probably one of the best coffees I have ever tasted.  If you are a coffee snob (and even if you are not), you will definitely love this.  Thank you Koffee Kult for offering this promotion so I could try this.  So glad I was able to try this because in the process I think I've found my new favorite.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAntiPoleez Breath Mints 360-Count Capsules (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI am a mint and gum freak.  I always have something in my purse because as Anthony Michael Hall said in \"16 Candles\"... \"Fresh breath is a priority in my life...\"  If I'm not always sucking on a mint or chewing gum I am handing it out because that is one of my pet peeves.  I have to say that I am quite impressed by these breath mints from AntiPoleez.  I really didn't know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised.  Be prepared because they're not \"minty\" at all. They have a medicine like taste and are a strange texture. They are strong...but not overwhelming.  The most important thing, though, is that they will knock out any kind of funkiness lingering in your mouth.  Garlic and coffee breath are the worst, but these mints took care of both.  I was amazed.  Make sure to suck on them though...don't try to chew them up to get rid of them...just let them dissolve in your mouth.  It says to use 2 at a time and you can use a 3rd if needed...but I've never needed the third.  They will get rid of any bad breath you have...gone...not just masking it or covering it up but will really get rid of it.  Good stuff and I highly recommend it.

Any little bag of coffee that is THAT expensive must be fabulous.  I've had good coffee before but to me a cup of SBUX is expensive.  I googled this type of coffee bean and found out that in some places people pay anywhere from $30-$100 per cup for this stuff.  Wow!  Coffee people don't joke around!  I used my grinder to grind this up very fine.  I like my coffee stronger so made it a little stronger than regular.  After we finished discussing the whole \"they get these beans from what?\" topic I shared a couple of pots this morning with my Mom and a friend.  The general consensus was this: it's a really good cup of coffee.  It is very smooth and has no bitterness whatsoever.  We enjoyed the coffee, yes, it was good.  $30-$100 a cup good?  Well, not on my budget but I guess if I had the money to spend I would probably buy it.  I'm glad I was able to purchase the beans at a discount for testing, evaluation and review but I can't see buying it regularly...unless I were to win the lottery.  Don't get me wrong, it is good coffee but just a little too expensive for me.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['coffee', 'taste', 'good', 'review', 'testing', 'little', 'really', 'discount', 'like', 'one']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nPG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 160Count Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is the best tea in the U.S. according to my tea loving daughters.

(Well not literally.  :)  ).  At first I didn't think they were bad, but wasn't overly impressed.  But after a bit I started to truly enjoy them, thus why I now give them a five star rating.  Due to their use of apple cider vinegar they do have a slightly sweet taste along with the garlic and dill, but not to the point of being nearly as sweet as a bread and butter.  I think if people don't get stuck in thinking they aren't like a kosher half sour pickle but are maybe in a category of their own, they will enjoy them as well.\n\nThey are pretty crisp as an aside also, and just slightly spicy.

Pandas are an endangered species!  The very idea that one would dice up a Panda and then use it as the meat in any meal is disgusting and unethical.  Yes, I know they claim this is sauce for Mongolian beef, but I'm sure that's to hide the fact that a panda is on the front of the label, thus clearly indicating that they expect people to use panda flesh!\n\nAs an aside, I have no problem with unusual or exotic meats in general, I'm far from a vegetarian.

In fact, I do wonder since this is a \"Newman's Own\" product if the late Paul Newman himself upchucked into a vat after eating a copious amount of cheese.

But I found it outside of someone's home as I was wandering the streets.  What I found to be exact was 3/4ths of one of the salami, in some sort of pet food dish as if left for a pet or some wildlife.  Well, since it was left outside, I decided that the owner might not care if I went ahead and ate it.  So I did, and it was wonderful!  I am only giving this product four stars since like \"Mntijo\" here with his review it was a bit greasy, and I also had stomach distress after eating it.  But this product is still delicious!  I do hope the owner of the home that placed this salami outside orders more, I'd love to get more free food of this caliber.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nOld Wisconsin Beef Snack Sticks, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nAlthough I've had better from local merchants and small businesses, these for being a \"major brand\" are very good.  Hopefully I don't come off as a food snob of some sort when I say that, but for the price point and in general I do enjoy this product.\n\nThe four star rating is more for the following:\n\n1)  They are very greasy, and very slightly sticky also.  The grease is more on the outside of the meat stick then in the meat proper oddly enough.\n2)  Although to me it was obvious based on the photo of the product, the package isn't resealable.  Far from a deal breaker, but don't be out of storage bags or containers when one first opens this.\n3)  The meat could be packed just a bit denser in the casing.  Not by much, but it could be.\n\nIf they made them less greasy and/or a bit more dense I would have come closer to giving this five stars.  Item 2 is more just to mention it, it's not a deal breaker for me at all.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nRose Pork Brains with Milk Gravy 5 Ounce Cans (4 Cans Per Pack)\nReview:\nThis is a wonderful product for those making a survival kit for surviving a zombie apocalypse.  First off, it's canned brains.  Being chased by zombies?  Pop open a can, and leave on the ground.  They will smell the brains and devour these instead of continue chasing you to eat your brains.  One can then run away, or if one has a ranged weapon like a firearm or bow can then run a bit, turn around and kill said zombie.  Of course, one can always eat these if one is desperate.  Or if one IS a zombie but still retains enough intellect to open canned goods.  The cans are small and compact, so keeping a few in a kit as zombie bait and/or emergency food is..pardon the pun, just a no brainer!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Sky Zero Calorie Stevia Soda (Lemon Lime, 12-Ounce Cans, Pack of 24)\nReview:\nI went ahead and decided to order a 24 pack of this product here on amazon.com.  It very much is a fine product with what I'd call a unique \"bite\".  It's not as sweet as many rootbeers, using either corn syrup or cane sugar as sweetner but it is how I'd imagine an old fashioned one might taste.  The closest comparison I can make is perhaps Virgil's, if you've had that you've had one that is somewhat similar, although Virgil's is still a bit sweeter.\n\nI'd lean toward Virgil's a tiny bit first, but this is still quite a good product, and one I'd purchase again from time to time.  My only issue was with packaging, which I already submitted in my packaging review to amazon.com.  (And I feel shouldn't be part of a product review in most cases anyway..or if mentioned then not included in the star rating).\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGolden Mountain Thai Seasoning Sauce - 6.7 oz x 3 bottles\nReview:\nThis does have a similar flavor to soy sauce.  It's slightly sweeter (but not by a huge degree at all) to \"pure\" soy that is just soybeans, salt and water though.  It otherwise isn't bad, but doesn't really strongly stand out.\n\nThis would be a four star review except for the following.  The plastic used on all three bottles for the lid is VERY cheap.  On all three, there is a ring tab pull to open the bottle under the lid.  In all three cases, the ring just broke off.  The plastic almost feels more like wax.  I had to take a knife and poke my own opening in each case to use this product.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nKraft Spicy Ranch Dressing, 15.8 Ounce\nReview:\nPeople I don't think see that this actually is a great product.  Okay, at first I was going to give this one star.  As a cheese dip for tortilla chips or to drizzle onto tacos, it's kind of horrid.  Not vomit flavor horrid but it's up there.  But then I got inspired, and decided to comb some into my hair.  This makes a WONDERFUL hair mousse!  My hair is so easy to style now using this.  Also, the delicate smell of cheese is much better then any cologne I've ever used.  My only warning is that it can be a bit tough to get out of one's hair unless the water is pretty hot, I do suggest a hot shower, scrub this out of the hair and then apply shampoo as usual.  But truly do try this as a hair mousse.

If I had read it at the store I wouldn't have bought it. Either way I popped some anyways. It's surprisingly good, it's not great though. It has more negatives than positives. The positives are that it has a sweet taste for sure, nothing chemical or weird though. That's about it for the positives. The negatives are that you need to eat a handful or the popcorn is bland, if you eat it in small handfuls THEN it tastes sugary and sweet. The popcorn is also cold, coming right out of the microwave, I think this is due to it not really having any coating like butter so it gets cold fast......I like warm popcorn. It's also really light and dry.......I like buttery popcorn. All in all this popcorn is good tasting and I am really picky about this stuff and artificial sweeteners, it doesn't taste fake or chemical to me. Have you ever had a popcorn ball? It tastes like a less sweet version. I happen to love popcorn balls, some people don't.\n\nUPDATE: I only ate 1 bag of this stuff. It's gross.

It's not overly spicy where you're running for water, but it's a great heat. I think Extra Hot would be a little much for me and the normal person. The taste is excellent.

A friend gave us a box of the \"Donut Shop\" cups and they are spectacular.  Very rich and bold, not bitter, but packs a nice punch.  Reminds me of coffee from an old-fashioned percolator.  A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Fresh tasting, with a sense of \"purity\" is how I would describe her hot sauces.

About equal to Tabasco. Think of 3 or 4 tiny drops in a large Bloody Mary.\n\nWhy 3 Stars? I'm seeking perfection!

I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to \"kick up\" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.\n\nI'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.\n\nAfter taste testing over 40 different hot sauces (everyone needs a hobby), writing up notes, test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old notes versus new notes ----- I have to say Tabasco's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested blind.\n\nTabasco's original has only two tastes: hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.\n\nI could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm quite certain you will be pleasantly surprised.\n\n1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar with a hint of sugar and garlic. Top rated by many. Found in most supermarkets if you look. If you look carefully you'll see it in most pantries on cooking shows\n2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers. Found in most supermarkets, look for the wooden top.\n3) Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce (milder and with less vinegar)\n4) Huichol Hot Sauce (milder - less vinegar - not widely available)\n5) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar).Found in most supermarkets.\n\nI hope I've encouraged everyone to try a few other hot sauces beyond this one\n\nPS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost impossible to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a \"plus\" in my view but rather a \"minus\" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!\n\nWhat more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce after trying a few other brands.\n\nUPDATE ----- A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW of Hot Sauces has come out: While my original review was written over a year prior - just recently America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED a number of HOT SAUCES.\n\nWhat sauce came in FIRST? ------ Huy Fong Sriracha.\n\nWhat sauce came in very LAST? ---- Tabasco\n\nI'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.\n\nTastes vary and Tabasco will suit those who like a lot of vinegar in their hot sauce.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nFrank's Redhot Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce, Fat Free Hot Wing Sauce, 23 oz\nReview:\nThis is a mild hot sauce. That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.\n\nIngredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etc\n\nWhy 2 stars? This sauce lacks any character beyond a heavy dose of vinegar. If you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you'll love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are many better ones.\n\nWhat is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.\n\nYou will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!\n\nSuggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then buy it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They cost little more than the smaller sizes.\n\nI'd encourage others to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar - you just might prefer any of these:\n\na) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! No vinegar.\n\nb) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar.\n\nc) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend.\n\nd) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.\n\ne) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but far less than Franks. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.\n\nIn my opinion, all of the above are far superior to Franks.\n\nIf you like Franks and are at the least bit curious, you should try any of these other hot sauces\n\nUPDATE (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen which is a TV program on PBS recently rated hot sauces. Tabasco came in last, Franks came in the middle and top rated was Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce\n\nPPS: Bon Appetit magazine recently rated Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce as \"ingredient of the year\"\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nTabasco Chipotle Pepper, 5 Ounce\nReview:\nThis is Tabasco's best tasting hot sauce! The Tabasco brand is traditionally associated with a very hot pepper (chile) sauce. This company has been branching out and now offers a number of new sauces. In my view, this is their very best sauce. In general, I'm not a fan of Tabasco products. Yet this one is excellent.\n\nThis sauce is based on the Chipotle - a smoke-dried jalapeno pepper.\n\nThe sauce is relatively mild (as is the chile) and it has the unique flavor, typical of this smoked pepper.\n\nI'd call this sauce almost sweet - much like semi-sweet dark chocolate BUT with the additional kick of some gentle heat.\n\nThe smoked taste of the Chipotle pepper is fairly unique. Keep in mind, if you like this sauce, you will probably be buying a bottle monthly - given its diluted nature. So if you are use to keeping a bottle of the traditional Tabasco hot sauce in your pantry for a year or more, it certainly won't happen with this variety.\n\nI've been taste tasting 7 other Chipotle hot sauces. This sauce is one of my favorites. The only real competitor is El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce. The Tabasco Chipotle has a bit more vinegar while the El Yucateco has some added sugar and tomato paste. Both are excellent.\n\nAs noted, this sauce is far more diluted than the traditional Tabasco hot sauce yet it is far more potent and richer tasting than many other Chipotle based sauces I've tried. At least, in this sauce the Chipotle flavor is concentrated and the added vinegar is not overpowering. Certainly this is the best tasting Tabasco hot sauce ever made and the only real competitor I can find is the El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce which has less vinegar and a bit more tomato taste. All the other Chipotle sauces I have taste tested are so diluted that they lack any real flavor and can be easily dis-qualified.\n\nTry a bottle - if you like the Chipotle pepper and I think you will - you'll love this sauce. You might also try the El Yucateco Chipotle which is also excellent yet a bit different. Beyond these two Chipotle based sauces I have not found any other Chipotle based sauces that come even close!\n\nHeads Up: You can probably find this sauce (in its smaller size) at any supermarket. I'm ordering a half gallon - on-line.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTabasco Chipotle Pepper, 5 Ounce\nReview:\nThis Chipotle Sauce offers some gentle heat along with the rich taste of a smoked Chipotle pepper. It makes a great Bloody/Virgin Mary and will add some interesting flavors to any dish that needs some heat. As another reviewer said -- this is probably the best tasting product within Tabasco's ever expanding lineup.\n\nI've taste tested 7 different Chipotle hot sauces and the Tabasco Chipotle is one of my favorites. The taste is very rich, smokey, semi-sweet and, for once, there is not too much vinegar! Yet make no mistake - there is a good dose of vinegar yet it is not over powering. It is quite simply one of the best Chipotle sauces I have taste tested.\n\nKeep in mind that this sauce is relatively mild when compared to the other Tabasco products.  In this particular sauce, the heat is far more subdued and not what I would have  expected from a Tabasco product. This sauce needs to viewed as a completely different product.  This is the best tasting Tabasco sauce I've ever tasted and beyond that -- near the best tasting Chipotle I have found.\n\nI paid $3.29 for it at my local supermarket. I doubt you'll have any trouble finding it locally and since tastes differ - I'd recommend you first buy a single bottle close to home. Then purchase a half gallon on-line.\n\nWhat sets this chipotle apart is the richness of its flavor. It is concentrated in the best possible sense. Rich, with some sweetness, smokey, some vinegar and a bit of gentle heat.\n\nI have repeatedly taste tested the following Chipotle:  Tabasco, La Victoria, El Pato, Cholula, Goya, Bufalo and El Yucateco.\n\nThe El Yucateco Chipotle is also superb and the only worthy competitor to this sauce. Both are rich - the Tabasco has more vinegar and the El Yucateco has a bit more sugar and a hint of tomato.\n\nUpdate: My favorite blend turns out to be tomato juice, a fairly heavy dose of Tabasco Chipotle plus a bit of Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. I also add a dash of Worchester sauce and lemon juice.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTuong Ot Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce 28oz\nReview:\nThis hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a cayenne pepper delivery device. A few drops add a lot of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.\n\nWhile Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a vinegar note - this product has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle sweetness with garlic notes to this sauce. While Tabasco can taste harsh if you add enough to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.\n\nI wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato is simply the sun ripened chilies and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste\n\nI like this product and I'd recommend its purchase but I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem, in any way, exceptional. There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic sure beats the vinegar aftertaste evidenced in Tabasco.\n\nFor the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to have it on hand.\n\nAs another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably only want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.\n\nUpdate (July 2010) - a formal taste test\n\nI put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too \"hot\" to taste\n\nResults: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh but sweeter note\n\nUpdate (August 2013): While my review was written some time ago - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS tested a wide number of hot sauces. What sauce came in last? Tabasco! First was the Huy Fong Sriracha.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n30 2.12OZ Packages Mama Tom Yum Flavour Instant Noodles (Shrimp Flavored)\nReview:\nGiven all the positive reviews I was anxious to try these noodles. Now I'm stuck with 30 packets.\n\nI was very disappointed. Apparently the many reviewers who have rated this product so highly have never tried any other Asian noodle soups.\n\nThe packets are quite small - a serving for one, at most. Much smaller than average!\n\nTaste - medium heat (using all of the flavor packets) combined with a hint of lemon grass and displaying no other flavors that I could detect. I found this soup rather bland although I did like that hint of lemon grass.\n\nWhy the discrepancy in reviews? Lets take one example: \"heat\" or \"spiciness\". Some reviewers rate this product as being \"very hot\" and others rate it as \"medium\". Why the difference? It really is quite simple: different cultures and different palates. For most Americans (if there is such a person) this soup may seem quite hot. However in many Asian cultures it is fairly mild. The beauty of ALL these types of noodles/soups is they provide a spice packet(s) and you can add as little or as much as you want. However with this soup - after using all the packets - it was relatively mild to me. I called it \"medium hot\"\n\nDeceptive advertising: There are no whole shrimp or shrimp pieces as depicted on the label. As I write this review - I'm looking at a packet and reading from its label: The Major Single ingredient is wheat flour, followed by palm oil, then salt, then sugar, then MSG, then dried red chili powder, then Chile powder, then ... well it goes on and on to finally include very small quanties of fish sauce and dried shrimp powder along with many other lesser ingredients. BTW: Ingrediants are always listed from largest to smallest on an ingrediant label\n\nNot recommended! A true two star product - mediocre\n\nAs an alternative try: Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun soup, Gourmet Spicy Picante. That soup offers more flavor and comes in a much larger serving size. The soup costs about $17.00 (with free shipping) for 20 much larger packets. That is not only a better deal, the soup has more flavor. Yet I only gave that soup three stars yet having tasted this one maybe it deserves 4 stars or this one deserves 1 star. Interestingly when I rated that soup with 3 stars I came under considerable fire from the many customers that rated it 5 stars. It seems people fall in love with whatever noodle soup they first encounter.\n\nI am NOT suggesting that Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun Gourmet Spicy Picante soup is some panacea. It is just another less than healthy quick noodle soup which I enjoy and I find tastes better than this one. Remember, I only gave the Nong Shin soup three stars.\n\nConclusion: The many 4/5 star reviews of Mama Tom Yum strike me as having been written by people with a very limited perspective. In other words they had not tried many of the other availabe noodle soups.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\n30 2.12OZ Packages Mama Tom Yum Flavour Instant Noodles (Shrimp Flavored)\nReview:\nGiven all the positive reviews, I was anxious to try these noodles.

As I write this review I'm looking at a packet and reading from its label: The Major Single ingredient is wheat flour, followed by palm oil, then salt, then sugar, then MSG, then dried red chili powder, then Chile powder, then ... well it goes on and on to finally list fish sauce and dried shrimp powder along with many other lesser ingredients\n\nNot recommended! A true two star product - mediocre\n\nAs an alternative try: Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun soup, Gourmet Spicy Picante. That soup offers more flavor and comes in a much larger serving size.  The soup costs about $17.00 (with free shipping) for 20 much larger packets. That is not only a better deal, the soup has more flavor. But I only gave that soup three stars.  Interestingly when I rated the Nong Shim soup at only 3 stars I came under considerable fire from many customers who had rated it 5 stars.\n\nI am NOT suggesting that Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun Gourmet Spicy Picante soup is some kind of panacea. It is just another less than healthy quick noodle soup which I enjoy more. Remember, I only gave that soup three stars.\n\nConclusion: The many over the top reviews of Mama Tom Yum (meaning 4/5 star reviews) strike me as having beem written by people with a very limited perspective\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nFranks Red Hot Sauce, 12 Ounce\nReview:\nFranks is a mild/diluted hot sauce containing some cayenne pepper along with a fairly heavy dose of vinegar. If you are just looking for a basic hot sauce that can be liberally applied then Franks might hit that mark, assuming you like this much vinegar.  The diluted nature of Franks makes it quite forgiving.\n\nIf you are a bit curious, then I suggest you try something else. You might be pleasantly surprised. Obviously, no reviewer can encompass the myriad of tastes that Amazon customers have. What a reviewer can do is suggest alternatives that might appeal to others.\n\nFor those of you who like Franks but are willing to experiment --- then I would suggest you try one or all of the following:\n\na) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerably more heat than Franks, on a drop per drop basis so it is much more potent. It is nicely balanced with a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic. It has No vinegar but, as noted, you'll need far less since it is far more potent than Franks.  Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! Amazon also carries it.\n\nb) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - low to medium heat and is readily available - look in the Mexican section or on Amazon. This sauce, given its lower heat level is almost a direct replacement for Franks but has, in my view, a far superior taste. It has some vinegar but is much better balanced than Franks.\n\nc) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle or on Amazon. Similar to Franks but a notch below Cholula in my view - but certainly worth a try - since tastes vary. It is excellent - I just happen to prefer the Huy Fong or Cholula.\n\nd) Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce - a well know national brand. The Chipotle pepper is smoked and has a unique flavor. Commonly available locally or on Amazon ---- but the taste of this smoked pepper is different - a bit sweeter and with a very pleasant smoked flavor. I really like this sauce and it is certainly well worth a try. Not terribly hot so on a drop by drop basis it is not any hotter than Franks. But the flavor is much better!\n\nI've given Franks 3 stars (which is a generous rating - I actually view it as a 2 star product).  The others sauces I've listed above I'd rate at least as a 4 star if not 5 star product. Why not experiment - at only a few dollars per bottle - why not?\n\nI can't encourage you enough to experiment and enjoy the process!!!!\n\nPS: There are a number of people who have settled on a single product (such as Franks) and hate the fact that anyone might suggest an alternative. These customers view any Amazon review that contradicts their beliefs as threatening and down rate it accordingly. That is unfortunate. This is nothing more than an honest attempt to suggest alternatives!\n\nUpdate (August 2013): While my review was written some time ago - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS tested a wide number of hot sauces. What sauce came in last? Tabasco! First was the Huy Fong Sriracha.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['sauce', 'hot', 'soup', 'taste', 'chipotle', 'one', 'tabasco', 'vinegar', 'sauces', 'salt']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nCrystal Light Raspberry Tea, (12-Quart) 1.6-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI love raspberry tea and this is the best mix I have been able to find.

To make microwave cocoa with it, one cup at a time, put a few teaspoons in the bottom of a cup, with a little cold water, and make a paste. (This mixes it without melting the cocoa, which is why microwave cocoa usually doesn't work.)  Pour regular or almond milk into the cup, once you have made your paste,  and microwave the cup on high for 1 1/2 minutes.  The result is a steaming, sweet, coffeeshop appropriate cocoa.\n\nThis is also truly gluten-free. I'm a celiac with a sixteen-year-old diagnosis, and this doesn't make me sick  at all.

After several weeks of doctor visits, discussions about IBS, and an abdominal ultrasound that came up normal, I started thinking about what was different in my diet:  I had been using agave nectar in my tea several times a day.  After throwing out the agave nectar and looking online for a list of lower fructose food, I changed my diet, a little.\n\nThe pain went away in a matter of days, and hasn't returned.\n\nIf you're using agave nectar and you have suddenly started having digestive issues, try getting rid of the agave nectar.

Kraft Grated Parmesan cheese has been around since 1945.  The container has been updated, but the cheese is still the queen.  There are more delicious variations, such as freshly grated . . . and now Kraft has a kind with the grater included so we can  grate our cheese to serve it fresh.  I still buy large amounts of the good basic grated parmesan in the refillable green shaker container. It is quick, and most people are in a hurry these days.  It will keep if we leave it on the table when we eat at the cafeteria.  Ususally at home, I keep it in the refrigerator.\n\nIt is great for a wide range of dishes, including pastas, soups, sauce, snack, bread, and meat. With only ten calories per teaspoon, we can sprinkle on all we want without feeling guilty.  The cheese taste is one I crave, and eating Kraft's Parmesan is a good way to satisfy that craving for cheese.\n\n Perhaps parmesan cheese has been around since the eighth century B. C. or was it developed about 400 years ago in in the Italian city of Parma?  There was a story that near Parma there was a mountain made entirely of parmesan cheese.  On top of the mountain a community of macaroini makers cooked hot pasta, bathed it in butter, and rolled it down the mountain to the hungry people below. There is a legend that it was used by Roman legionniares becaue it lasted throughout their long journeys.

My friend and I are spicemouths, and we found the mixers decently flavored, perhaps better than some dishes we've tried in Italian restaurants that needed to fire their cooks.  We eat in many different restaurants throughout the United States to evaluate the food.  What we have discovered is that mediocre food can be made tasty if we apply our emergency taste-enhancer kit.  Actually this dish was better than mediocre; in fact it was tasty, especially after we added some items from the kit. (We keep an array of items in our glove compartments of our vehicles and on our breakfast bar.)

That's all we added, although we do have other items in our emergency supplies.  With those two little items, the ziti and meat sauce tasted good.\n\nPreparing it was fun.  The cute little container with the strainer lid amused me.  I thought I would wash it and reuse it, but I was amazed to discover it was engineered for single use.\n\nThis meal of 340 calories was satisfying and handled our hunger efficiently.  It contains 600 mg sodium, which is perhaps a little less than some prepared dishes.  I was surprised to see that it contains 990 mg potassium.  People with renal disease should probably avoid this product unless they have the approval of their physician or registered dietician. There are 6 grams of total fat and 56 carb grams. With 8 grams of dietary fiber, it should get an approving nod from Weight Watchers. It meets the criteria established by the American Heart Association.\n\nI would recommend this dish for anyone who needs to take lunch to work where there is no refrigerator but where there is a microwave oven.  I thought we would eat it again soon, but weeks have passed and we are still thinking about it.\n\nMostly recommended.\n\nMary Lou Cheatham, co-author of THE COLLARD PATCH/\nAuthor of FLAVORED WITH LOVE, SOLOMON'S PORCH,\nDO YOU KNOW HOW GOD LOVES YOU?\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSun Maid California Raisins, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nWe like raisins (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sun-Maid-Raisins-12-Ounce-Bags-Pack-of-6/dp/B000IZQMRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sun Maid Raisins, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>), and if you knew how many we eat, you would be shocked.

We placed an eclectic group of ingredients in Fish Couvillion, a classic Cajun food. We were working to achieve a Texas variation.  Then we served some delicious collard greens over the rice, and we topped it off with the Couvillion. This mixture served on top of the marvelous Texmati Brown rice, which is also a hybrid, is so good that all who ate it kept eating until they could not put another bite into their mouths.\n\nI like RiceSelect Long Grain Texmati Brown Rice seasoned simply with butter and a dash of salt.  It is so interesting that I like to savor the flavors.\n\nI hope you find this review helpful.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCrystal Light Sunrise Ruby Red Grapefruit, 3.4-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nWe tried&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Sunrise-Ruby-Red-Grapefruit-3-4-Ounce-Unit-Pack-of-6/dp/B0019N9V6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Sunrise Ruby Red Grapefruit, 3.4-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)</a>, and we really liked it.

However, wish Cameron's was available in a larger quantity order than 12 per box. This makes them as pricey as full-packaging k-cups. BUT I do like this particular flavor. Combo of vanilla and hazelnut is great. The hazelnut is pleasantly strong but bitterness I've found in other hazelnut coffees is tempered by the vanilla. The vanilla is not so much strong but is creamy. Coffee itself is rich and good tasting.

I, personally like brown rice, etc., but I have a family that for the most part thinks anything healthy doesn't taste good.  I ordered it and served it and everyone liked it.  Even my most staunch \"I hate healthy food\" critic, my teenaged son admitted he liked it.  My only complaint would be the price which I think is too high and when you add shipping it becomes a luxury item. Healthy, complete grains that haven't been processed should be cheaper than their processed counterparts, or at least closer in price.  It's so much cheaper to eat unhealthy.

Its real metal and glass so its authentic and has a coin mechanism all ready to go.  It's easy to fill and I personally kept the coin mechanism attached so that I'd have to THINK before getting more candy.  I've been using pennies to \"buy\" my candy from the machine which dispenses about 3-4 jelly beans at a time.  It's really the right amount because it satisfies my sweet tooth and I know that I can always go back for more (since the portions are so small).\n\n*You will need to buy Jelly Belly's separately because it only comes with a tiny single serve pack.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCrazy Cups Coffee Chocolate Lovers Single Serve Cups Variety Pack Sampler for the K&nbsp;Cup&nbsp;Brewer, 24 count\nReview:\nYum, Yum, Yum!!

I am not a huge fan of traditional oatmeal or cream of wheat so I was not expecting this to wow me.  Some reviewers had mentioned the tiny portion size of just 1/3 cup was not enough to satisfy them.  I just received this and quickly made myself a portion. I scooped out 1/3 of a cup of the hot cereal into a bowl and added 1/2 cup of hot skim milk, 1 tbs of real maple syrup, 1/2 banana, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  I have to admit, it is good!  It has a similar consistency to a thick cream of wheat instead of a steel cut oatmeal.  The portion once made is a generous amount.  If you are used to using preportioned oatmeal sachets from a box then you will be pleasantly surprised at how much just 1/3 of a cup makes you!  It tastes strongly of coconut which I do not mind.  I will purchase another bag so that I won't run out when I start work next week.

It was a liquid meal sold as a diet aid.  Four cans a day @ 225 calories a can was supposed to be a full day's nutrition.  Metrecal was the first thing I thought of when I tasted Boost 100.  So I got curious and went to look up Metrecal which has been off the market since the mid-70s.  From what I can gather the ingredients are roughly the same, skim milk powder, soy protein, oil, vitamins and minerals.  Since both Boost and Metrecal have their roots in nutritional supplements for people who can't have a solid diet for whatever reason, it stands to reason that if it worked then, it's still going to work.  And in fact that combination delivers a solid 10 grams of protein in each bottle, plus vitamins, minerals, some carbs and fats.  It's a solid nutritional supplement with the added benefit of being low in calories\n\nNow if you look up Metrecal online you'll see all sorts of hand-waving about how awful it tasted.  While I think that's mostly hyperbole from people who probably never even tasted the stuff,  I'm not going to try to tell you it was the best thing since Cherry Garcia ice cream.  It wasn't and neither is Boost 100.  It's drinkable, nothing more.  It's not a treat, but it won't make you gag.  The advantage to Boost is the nutrition.  If, for whatever reason, your diet isn't giving you enough nutrition, then this may help  Personally I have a lot of trouble getting enough protein in my diet, so Boost is something that I may use on a regular basis.  Not enthusiastically, mind you, but because it's one of the better choices.\n\nBottom line, it's probably as good as any other convenient nutritional supplement.  I think it's a bit pricey at a bit over $2 a bottle, but if you don't use more than one a day, it's not not a bad investment in your health.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nThai Kitchen Coconut Milk, 13.66 fl oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nOf all the coconut milk I've tried, Thai Kitchen seems to give me the best flavor and consistency.

Normally it's kind of expensive, but the price here on Amazon comes to just under $1.45 per can which is a great price.  Always assuming you can buy in bulk that is.\n\nIf you do use a lot of this stuff, Amazon is probably your best resource.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWholesome Sweeteners Organic Fair Trade Honey, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nOrganic and fair trade are two designations I like to see on products I buy. Together they're nearly irresistible, but of course a lot depends on whether the product is worth buying.  Does it taste good?  Wholesome Sweeteners honey does taste good.  It's a dark amber honey with the kind of slight bitterness you find in buckwheat honey.  It also has an odd flavor, probably because I'm unused to honey produced from South American plants.  Not unappealing, just different.\n\nIf you can find something like this that suits your tastes and covers a lot of socio-political bases as well, why not buy it?\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nIndia Tree Dark Muscovado Sugar, 1 Pound (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis is possibly the best-tasting dark brown sugar I've ever used.

I think you'll find it complex, warm and welcoming.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRice Select Royal Blend, Whole Grain Texmati Brown &amp; Wild Rice with Soft Wheat &amp; Rye Berries, 28 oz Jars (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nIn an attempt to make my diet less dependent upon simple carbs, I've been shopping for whole grain products that don't taste like sand, cardboard or twigs and pebbles.  RiceSelect has come up with a clear winner with this blend of three different grain products: Two types of rice, barley and rye.  It has a warm, comforting quality, good flavor and is just loaded with the kind of fiber we all need.  You could do a lot worse and believe me, I have.\n\nTry cooking it in stock or broth and adding just a touch of butter and salt.  I make mine in my rice cooker (If you eat a lot of grains, get one.  Trust me on this, you'll thank me in the end.  Zojirushi makes some of the best.) and it's a nearly no-fuss operation.  Ingredients in, cooker on, walk away.  Come back to an amazing meal.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeanut Butter &amp; Co. Vanilla Peanut Powder, Non-GMO Project Verified, Gluten Free, Vegan, 6.5 oz Jar\nReview:\nI've tried several PB powders in an effort to add protein and flavor to smoothies.  Mostly the result is iffy because, of course, when you take the fat out of food, you're removing the thing which conveys flavor.  You can up the flavor stakes by adding a whole lot more of the PB powder to whatever it is you're making, or you can add some sugar which is a flavor intensifier.  That's what's Peanut Butter & Company has done here.  A normal serving adds enough flavor to my smoothies that I'm satisfied.\n\nI don't much like the powder mixed into a butter, but that's not why I bought it.  In the final analysis I got what I wanted, but it does come at a substantially higher price than using plain peanut butter and a sprinkle of cocoa, so it's a trade-off.  Ultimately I may just opt to use this as an additive in baking and go back to a spoonful of real peanut butter in my smoothie.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nV8 Healthy Greens, 12 oz. Bottle (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI decided to give this a shot under the most demanding circumstances.  I poured myself a glass out of a room-temperature bottle.  If it was palatable like that, it would be fine cold, or mixed into smoothies and such.  And on my first sip I made a really unpleasant noise, at least in part because the flavor is so dramatically different from the aroma.  It smells strongly of green apples, but the flavor is very far from anything like that.  My first thought?  Ugh.\n\nBut frequently first impressions are wrong, and I kept drinking, a bit at a time.  And as I did, I grew used to the flavor fairly quickly and found that, while it wasn't insanely delicious, it was good enough for what it was, a blend of fruit and vegetables to help get what, for most people, is much-needed nutrition.  Americans don't eat enough fruits and vegetables, and if this gets some of those nutrients into us, then yay, good on V8.\n\nIs it as good for you as a piece of fruit or a serving of veggies?  Heck no!  For one thing there's nearly no fiber in this juice -- a single gram per serving -- and fiber is one of the more important things you get out of produce.  You can, if you're so inclined, add fiber with any one of the bazillion fiber supplements on the market.  I don't think it's a patch on a fresh nectarine or a plate of carrot sticks, but it'll do.  And it has a reasonable amount of vitamins, mostly C.\n\nSo the bottom line here is that this isn't a great substitute for fresh produce by any stretch, but if you cannot or will not eat fresh produce, at least it's something.  The flavor is okay, it'll make a good base for smoothies, or be reasonably drinkable out of the fridge or even on the rocks.  Not going to be my favorite thing ever, but I could honestly say that about anything that's not ice cream.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nChocolove Peppermint Dark Chocolate, 3.2000-ounces (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI bought these for my sister who loves chocolate and peppermint.  I don't really care for the combo very much and avoid it when I can, but I had a chocolate emergency one afternoon and grabbed a bar. I was pleasantly surprised.  There was a good balance of mint to chocolate, so that neither was dominant, and I actually enjoyed eating it.\n\nWould I buy it for myself?  No.  But if someone handed me one I wouldn't give it away.  And that's about as much praise as I could give for something like this.  It's that good.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNature's Charm Sweetned Condensed Coconut Milk, 11.25 Ounce. (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI admit I was skeptical when I was asked to try this product (which I was given for the purposes of an accurate and honest review.)  Coconut is such a trendy product in all its forms these days and I thought  \"Oh... bandwagon.\"  But I have to admit that I am won over by this Nature's Charm product.  It's very like sweetened condensed (cow's) milk, though in cooler temperatures it tends to veer towards slightly more solid form.  That's not a huge problem though, a quick stir and it becomes liquid enough to pour.  You will find solid bits in the can, solidified coconut oil I'm assuming, but it's not a huge problem if you're cooking with the milk because they will melt quickly and easily.  It's made out of coconut milk and cane sugar with a touch of salt, a simple combination not unlike its more familiar cow's milk-based counterpart.\n\nThe flavor?  Definitely coconut-y, though I found that when used in baked goods, it doesn't impart a strong coconut flavor to the finished product.  In coffee, the flavor is more pronounced.  I have also used it in place of jam or preserves in yogurt jars (a layer of some kind of sweet add-in, perhaps some fruit on top of that, and about six ounces of Greek yogurt. I make up the jars once a week and have a grab-and-go meal or snack at hand.) and the result is as good as any commercial coconut yogurt I've tried.  Also a lot cheaper.\n\nBut for me the true test was how it affected my baked goods.  I've been making magic bars over the last few months (a base of graham cracker crumbs and butter, sprinkled with nuts, coconut, and chocolate chips, with sweetened condensed milk drizzled over the top before baking.  The recipe is easy to find online.) and wondered if coconut milk would work with them as well as the regular sweetened condensed milk.  Frankly, I think the Nature's Charm worked better.  I made what I feel is my best batch yet using Nature's Charm and the flavor is outstanding.  Again, not overly coconut-y in spite of the coconut milk and shredded (unsweetened) coconut.  Just the right consistency and a pleasant chocolatey-nut flavor.  Based on that alone I'd say that Nature's Charm sweetened condensed coconut milk is the winner of that particular taste test.\n\nI admit I haven't tired caramelizing it, or using it in a pie because I never make pies.  But I'm guessing that it will perform well.  And if you're the sort of person who occasionally eats this stuff out of the can, it's pretty tasty as is.  Honestly I'd have to say that if you have any interest at all in switching out your regular sweetened condensed milk with something lactose-free, this would be something to try.  Take it from a skeptic.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar, Dark Cherry, 1.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nNutrition/energy bars are an iffy proposition.  Even if it sounds like you might like it, you could easily find yourself biting into something that's a bit like a mixture of sawdust and rubber cement.  Fortunately the Eat, Think, Smile (Odd name, that.) Dark Cherry bar is pretty tasty, though it does suffer from a little bit of dryness.  Nevertheless, it's got a brownie-like quality that I enjoy, and if the cherry flavor isn't as cherry-like as you might hope, it's a small thing, really.  What you've got is a nice, nutty, chewy, cakey bar that has 6 grams of fiber per 200 calorie bar, and 4 grams of protein.  That's not bad, really.\n\nWhat ETS is promoting here is the antioxidant quality of cocoa. I'm as thrilled as the next chocoholic to think that my favorite indulgence might be good for me, but I really don't know how to evaluate the claim that one sort of cocoa is better than another, or that it's all better than green tea, and honestly if you're eating chocolate because you think it'll improve your health, it might be time to reevaluate the rest of your lifestyle.\n\nNevertheless, these bars might be just the thing if you want a fast snack.  They're small; they'll fit easily in a purse or pocket.

My first taste of this one, it was pretty nasty. A couple days later I tried another little bag. Maybe slightly less nasty as I wasn't taken by surprise how bad it was. I can imagine someone might like it, but most I suspect would find it gruesome. Feeling guilty to do so, I gave the rest of the little bags to the student food bank on campus.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nKraft Easy Mac Triple Cheese, 2.05-Ounce Microwavable Cups (Pack of 10)\nReview:\nFor flavor and handiness in a lunch bucket to take to work, this is pretty darned good. My single complaint is how we really can't figure out how to keep it from boiling over. The directions are out of the question in two microwaves we've tried, but shortening the time to avoid boiling over the top means not quite finished pasta, unless it sits longer than anyone would be willing to wait. So we've found it an item which though easy to like we don't often obtain because there's always a boil-over mess and a feeling of wastage.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSimply Lite Low Carb Dark Chocolate Sugar-Free 50% Cacao 3-Ounce Ba Roasted (Pack of 10)\nReview:\nNot the worst low car chocolate I've ever had, but close.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nTasty Bite Brown Rice Lentil 8.8 Ounce (Pack of 6), Whole Grain Brown Rice with Savory Lentils and Herbs, Gluten Free, Vegan, Ready to Eat, Microwaveable\nReview:\nNot bad but not great either. I got several bags of it and will use it all up eventually, but no one's in a great hurry. Needs to be used thinly on a great deal of rice or potatoes so that the flavor doesn't dominate so much.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBarbara's Cheese Puffs, Baked White Cheddar, 5.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI hadn't had Barbara's cheese puffs in quite a few years. I remember I used to be addicted to them when I lived next door to a health food store and only had to pop in to get them. Finding myself pondering how simply horrible Cheetos are -- barely-cheese-flavored packing peanuts -- I suddenly wondered if I'd still find Barbara's wonderful. And I sure do! The flavor is specific to this brand and just splendid. Now that it's a product back in my life I'm afraid I'll have to be reordering it regularly.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBarbara's Cheese Puffs, Baked White Cheddar, 5.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nBarbara's \"Original\" cheese puffs are the best, so good, I've loved 'em for years. But alas the \"baked white cheddar\" puffs are nearly flavorless and just no comparison at all to the Original. I will be a forever-customer for the Original, but baked white cheddar, never again for me.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBarbara's Cheese Puffs, Baked White Cheddar, 5.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI ordered \"Original\" because Barbara's original cheese puffs are the only truly great cheese puff brand in the whole world. They sent me Jalapeno by accident and I almost returned them but that's such a bother. I don't like really hot spicy stuff. But I kept them, and I began to eat them, and at first I was going to give it a 4 star review because these are great but not what I ordered. But then I realized I never would've ordered anything labeled Jalapeno, the only way I found out they are great is because they sent me a case of bags of it by accident, so full five stars. They're not spicy-hot at all by the way. If someone actually wanted to burn their tongue a bit, they might be disappointed. But for me these are tasty as all get-out.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSimply Lite Low Carb Dark Chocolate with Almonds, 45% Cacao, 3-Ounce Bars (Pack of 9)\nReview:\nHardly any almonds in this bar, and the dark chocolate tastes like faintly chocolate flavored wax. And \"no sugar added\" should be illegal to advertise for stuff that has sugar alcohol in it, because sugar alcohol IS sugar. It metabolizes more slowly than sucrose, so SLIGHTLY better for a diabetic than white sugar, but generally should not be considered suited for diabetics. The specific sugar alcohol they use is Maltitol, and many people are very sensitive to this, it causes radical nasty tasting belches, stomach pain, and severe diarrhea. In several countries (but not the USA which favors corporate needs over customer) maltitol requires health warnings, and if someone failed to realize what was causing their diarrhea and life-threatening dehydration, they might keep eating the candy until hospitalized.\nRating:\n1.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'one', 'good', 'better', 'flavor', 'sugar', 'time', 'really', 'much', 'would']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\n Dr. Mercola Organic Cocoa Cassava Energy Bars - 12 Ct. Box - USDA Certified Organic w/Dark Chocolate, Chia Seeds, Almond Butter - Healthy Gluten Free Snacks, Great Meal Replacement Bars \nReview:\nOn the plus side:\n\n* They taste great.\n* Great texture. They melt in your mouth.\n* They have some wonderful ingredients... organic raw dark chocolate, organic coconut, organic raw chia seeds, organic raw almonds, organic coconut oil.  Really an amazing collection of healthful ingredients, compared to almost any other bar out there.\n* They're satisfying and filling, without being large.\n* They're sweet but not overly sweet.\n* One reviewer was irritated that the bar is smaller than the packaging, and felt that this was deceptive.  I like their small size personally, and don't feel its deceptive. (Anyone picking up a bar to buy it would realize that it's a little smaller than the wrapper).  They're small because they're not filled with soy and other toxic fillers, and they're lightweight and easy to carry.  I'd rather have a small energy bar full of wonderful organic ingredients, than a large one full of barely edible junk.\n\nOn the down side:\n\n* They're high in carbs.  23 grams of carbs minus 4 grams of fiber still leaves 19 grams of carbs.\n* They contain sugar. True, it's organic sugar, and is better for people than high fructose corn syrup, but it's still not good for your teeth.\n\nSuggestions for Mercola:\n* I hope that at some point this bar will be reformulated, and the sugar replaced with xylitol or lo han.  This would lower both the carbs and the sugar, and create an even more healthful treat.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Also beats the store bought salsas hands down, with the added advantage that you can put into your salsa exactly what you want.

Tastes great without salt, but a little bit doesn't seem to bother me. This is so easy to make a l-o-o-o-t of salsa with, too -- like for parties.  And that strained off juice?

Ghee can be used to make other saut pan frying food as well. I use it for making omelets on frying pan to coat the pan and to season it.  Depending what you do, you can substitute a grape seed oil or canola oil with ghee for cooking. Ghee gives nutty flavor because while clarified butter is when water evaporates from butter and milk solids separates from fat.

If you think Tabasco and sriracha are hot, this sauce is not for you. My lips were chapped when I first tried this so I got a lip burn. That was the only burn...not my mouth, tongue or gut was affected. I actually added some vinegar to it for more acid. Decent sauce that is good to put out for guests that claim  they love spicy stuff! Most end up chugging beer or trying to hide their discomfort...like red faces, tearing eyes, sweating.

I once made my own macadamia nut butter in a blender and it was the best thing I've ever tasted in my life.  It's expensive though, and messy to make, so I bought this.

There are no artificial flavors and no colors from artificial sources. One can will give you on average 1.5 servings. There are 130 mg calories per serving which is a very good deal. The deal breaker is that there is also 690mg of sodium. This is equal to 30% of our daily recommended value. We eat too much sodium, and this soup should be a once in awhile Soup.

As others have stated I expected some crunch, and there is none. What we have here is called soft food product which could have so many uses. I was not particularly fond of the banana flavor, it seemed a little off. It would be good with banana bread or muffins.\n\nI can also see this as a great food product to bring on a hike or for school or work treats. My daughter is a runner, and if she needs something while running she could put a handful in a pocket. It could be used as a cereal type product with milk. Lots of uses, this particular flavor was not one for me.\n\nRecommended. prisrob 05-12-17\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBarilla Pasta, Veggie Rotini, 12 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nBarilla is my choice for pasta, it tastes good, holds up well with sauces and other toppings, and has a goid brand name.

Pike Place Roast has\nbecome my favorite. Sometimes I alternate between Sumatra and Pike Place, but Pike Place wins out\nevery time! It has a taste of cocoa, with roasted nuts in its flavor. It has a smooth finish with\nsoft acidity. This has become the roast I have, all the time. Satisfying with enough depth and\nflavor to please.\n\nI have been tempted at times to buy a Keurig type coffee maker, but discovered that I would be paying\non average $50 a pound for the coffee found in those little Keurig cups. The price for a pound of\nPike Place Roast is $12.99.\n\nI found this recipe for making good coffee from Starbucks a few years ago, and this is the one I use\n'til this day.\n\nRecipe for great coffee\n 1. Use cold, filtered water and a clean machine.\n 2. Grind beans just before brewing: *Course for coffee press\n*Medium for automatic drip\n\n3. Measure 2 tbsp (10 g) ground coffee for every 6 fl oz (180 ml) water.\n\nTo help preserve that fresh flavor, keep this bag sealed tight in the bag.\n\nHighly Recommended. prisrob 02-11-12\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Onward-How-Starbucks-Fought-for-Its-Life-without-Losing-Its-Soul/dp/1605292885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Starbucks-Experience-5-Principles-for-Turning-Ordinary-Into-Extraordinary/dp/0071477845/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Starbucks Experience: 5 Principles for Turning Ordinary Into Extraordinary</a>\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPopchips Potato Chips, Sea Salt, 6.25 Ounce, (Pack of 6)\nReview:\n4.5 stars\n\nMy son was a big proponent of these chips, and I first tasted the Sour Cream and Onion.

The taste is not the greatest either, well not for me, I prefer the raw stevia, it taste better. It's an okay product- however to each-es own.\n\n1. This is not just Stevia- it has another raw sugar in it called cain sugar which gives 1.2g of sugar and 1.2g of total carbs and 5calories per serving- so be aware diabetics.\n\nCane sugar (raw sugar) is sucrose which has been extracted from sugarcane, a tropical plant which produces naturally high concentrations of this sweet substance. No one will claim that sugar is good for you, but raw sugar is more healthful than refined sugar because there are no chemical additives. Raw sugar is minimally processed, making it a natural product and easier for your body to digest. All sugar is high in calories and low in\n\n2. Now the Sweetleaf in the packets (THIS PRODUCT) has Inulin and Stevia Extract- the inulin which gives the fiber- so this has less than 1g of fiber- zero carbs zero sugar listed and zero calories per serving.\n\nInulin is a polysaccharide that is produced by plants such as onions, leeks, Jerusalem artichokes, and garlic. It can also be referred to as neosugar, alant starch, Alantin, and diabetic sugar. Many manufacturers are putting it in processed foods because it has tremendous health benefits. It can also be used to replace higher calorie ingredients such as fat, sugar, and flour. However, there is also some controversy about how much it should be used.\nThere are many ways that plants store energy for themselves, with inulin being one of them. As such, it can be found in the roots and rhizomes of many plants. When eaten, this substance does not increase blood sugar, which makes it an option for those with diabetes.\nThere are many benefits of inulin. It has one-third to one-fourth less food energy than that of sugar and a sixth to a ninth less energy than fat. It is also a soluble fiber which means that when it passes through the body, it creates a gel. Since fiber is not digested in the human body, it passes through to the intestine largely intact. There, it feeds the good bacteria that live there. It also helps to reduce the absorption of bad cholesterol in the body.\n\n3. Stevia in the Raw has \"less than 1g of both sugar and carbs- ingredients are Dextrose and stevia leaf extract- however zero cal per serving\n\nDextrose is an organic compound.. It is manufactured naturally in the human body from the breakdown of mainly carbohydrates, but also proteins and fats. Dextrose is the result of photosynthesis in plants and is found in concentrated amounts in fruits and honey. This white, sweet, crystalline substance can be produced synthetically from starch. The names dextrose and glucose are often used interchangeably, but it is important to note the difference. Glucose has several molecular forms. Dextrose is the biologically active form and is very common in plant and animal life.\n\nStevia is a word both for a plant and for a sweetener extracted from the leaves of that plant. stevia is much sweeter than other sugars, meaning that only a small amount needs to be used. The body also processes stevia very slowly, which greatly reduces the risk of a sugar high. it is essentially calorie free, which is why it is popular with dieters. it may be safe for diabetics, but diabetics should always consult their doctors about additions to their diet which may alter their blood sugar.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nCaffe D'Vita Imported Instant Espresso, 3-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nthis is much better than spending all that money on that very small bottle of expresso mix- it works just as well to enhance the flavor of your chocolate dishes\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStrawberry Syrup Organic, 12 oz.\nReview:\nI just used this health Strawberry Syrup on my pancakes today, its taste is superb, it's certified organic, all natural, reduced sugar and no preservatives, the ingredients are: Strawberries, apples, cane sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon, it's also Vegan.

In English, most (but not all) bakers have adopted the French spelling of macaron for the meringue-based item, to distinguish the two. This has caused confusion over the correct spelling. Some recipes(not all)exclude the use of macaroon to refer to this French confection while others treat the two as synonymous.  Etymologically, the word macaroon is simply an Anglicisation of the French word macaron (compare balloon, from French ballon). Multiple pronunciations are technically correct depending on personal preference and context. Macaroon is a coconut cookie but French Macaroon is a meringue base cookie.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCK Products 4 Ounce Black Crystal Sugar\nReview:\nI purchased this because I had a cake order that required black sprinkles of course by the person that requested the cake.

We normally buy the standard Gatorade mix from the grocery store, but were intrigued with the new carb-recovery drink.  So, he put it to the test.  For flavor, he states that this drink tastes pretty similar to the original orange, which is refreshing.  Those who like standard Gatorade may find this a little on the overly-sweet side, as it is higher in carbs and sweetness than the \"original\" drink.  For flavor alone, that was our only caution and the reason for withholding 1 star.  However, after one particularly difficult workout (a long, sweat-soaked round of shoveling after a PA snow storm) he thought that the flavor and sweetness were fine.\nHis personal recommendation was that this drink did a better job than the standard Gatorade of getting him back on his feet hydration-wise.  We have often found that after a grueling workout he battles dehydration for the rest of the day, which also leads to exhaustion.  In my years as a personal trainer, I have learned that the body maintains hydration best when it is accompied by a moderate dose of carbs because it helps the water stay in the body longer, thus making it more available to recovering muscles.  Generally speaking, he felt that his total recovery from the workout was significantly faster and better than with the standard sports drink, and the flavor is good if you're not taking anything else sweet at the same time.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It smells so yummy and it is just as yummy as it smells. It is not at all similar to traditional hot chocolate that you might have grown up with in the U.S.\n\nAbuelita comes in a hard chocolate disk. You melt this in warm milk and it makes a very light colored hot cocoa that smells of cinnamon and tastes wonderful. I believe you are supposed to use the whole disk if you are making many servings. To do a serving for one I believe you use about a 1/3 to a 1/4th of a disk. We have found that to make three servings, if we use about a 1/3 to a 1/2 of a disk that is the perfect ratio for our tastes in our family.\n\nAlthough the disks are hard, they are not difficult to break apart. You can take a kitchen butter knife and put a little pressure on the center of the disk and it will generally break up into several pieces.\n\nWe do not like to put things like whipped cream or marshmallows in this hot cocoa. It is simply perfect the way it is. It is easy to fix. It definitely has cinnamon in it. You can smell it and taste it but it is not an over powering cinnamon taste.\n\nWell worth the money.

Everyone in my family that tried them (three kids and myself) thought that they tasted just fine.\n\nThey earn a four star rating however, because they were very sticky. We were not easily able to pull apart the strips and handling these were very sticky. We tried to just open one end of the package and slide the strip out of the package to eat it. However the sticks even stuck to the package. We could not find an easy way to eat these and keep our fingers from being sticky.\n\nI like that they are 100% fruit juice. I like the taste. The stickyness is not a big problem, but it is something you might want to be aware of if you are ordering this for little kids or snacks in your car; for example.\n\nEnjoy.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Cane Syrup - Steen&#39;s 100% Pure - 12 Fl 0z. can \nReview:\nWhen we visit Louisiana we buy this by the dozens.

Before pure Stevia, I used Splenda and later Truvia/Purevia (Stevia cut with bulking agents) for several years. The Truvia/Purevia were better than Splenda, but both the Splenda and Truvia/Purevia left disgusting residues and just didn't taste right (because of the fillers or bulking agents added). More importantly for me, I could not fully enjoy my gourmet coffee with either. When I first began using pure Stevia, I appreciated the better flavor and lack of a residue, but it still did not taste quite like sugar to me. However, after a few months, Stevia tasted like sugar to me, and I could again enjoy gourmet coffee.  In short, there is an adjustment period.\n\nPerhaps more precisely, pure stevia is \"as effective\" as sugar for \"cutting the edge\" of bitter or sour drinks and foods---the way most people use sugar. However, it is not as \"lusciously\" sugary-sweet as sugar, regardless of how much you use. For a rare, once-a-month \"desert\" cup of fine coffee, I still use real sugar and real cream. For lemonade and other very sour drinks, Splenda tastes better than stevia, to me.\n\nFor years I used KAI PURE STEVIA---until they started adulterating in.  Then I tried another Chinese brand which claimed to be pure, but was \"diluted\" with some sort of filler.  I'm not sure this \"Select Stevia\" is quite as sweet as the original KAI, but it is the best brand currently available that I've found.\n\nMEASUREMENT\nOne \"tiny spoon\" (included) of STEVIA POWDER = 1 teaspoon of sugar.  The 1 oz jars are more convenient than the 3.5 oz jars, because the included \"tiny spoon\" can reach to nearly the bottom of the jars.  It is hard to get near the bottom of the larger jars.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\nA rubber band (ideally a fat \"broccoli\" rubber band) is ideal for holding the \"tiny spoon\" to the side of the bottle.  A paperclip makes a good permanent tab for lifting the rubber band to insert the spoon.\n\nWHEN TRUVIA OR PURVIA MIGHT BE A BETTER CHOICE\n> I carry packets of Truvia with me when I travel by air, because I do not want to take the chance on being detained to explain loose white powder to TSA/DEA agents.\n> There is really no effective way to sprinkle pure stevia over fruit, etc. it is just too concentrated.  Truvia/Purvia or Splenda are better for such uses.  Indeed, if you regularly sweeten your coffee with pure stevia near your cutting board, you are likely to find all kinds of odd things, such as sweet broccoli, having been sweetened by the invisible residue of escaped stevia.\n\nIS NATURAL BETTER?\nNot necessarily.  The most toxic and carcinogenic substances known are \"natural\".  In fact, most \"flavorful\" natural compounds, including most spices and herbs, are created by plants as insect toxins.  However, natural compounds are \"designed\" by nature to interact with biological systems, either in a good way or a bad way.  If a natural compound is not obviously bad, it is probably good, or at least not harmful.  The same cannot be said of artificial compounds, which may have subtle effects.  So, on that basis. natural IS better.  However, it may be more important how the compound is processed and packaged (i.e., possibly with traces of very bad substances) than the source (artificial or natural) of the main substance.  Using well-known major brandnames is the only even partial insurance of careful processing and packaging.\n\n> [...]\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNavitas Organics Chia Seed Powder, 8 oz. Bag\nReview:\nMY EXPERIENCE\n> I was intrigued by the promise of tapioca-like pudding which didn't have to be cooked.  I love tapioca, but it is just too much work.  I was somewhat disappointed with the chia pudding.  There is a vague similarity between chia pudding and tapioca pudding, but chia pudding simply is not tapioca.\n> Chia pudding is more of a bland yogurt-like substance, which goes better with fresh fruit (berries, bananas, peaches, etc.) than alone.  Indeed, my impression from the internet is that chia pudding (made with almond milk, soy milk, or water) is most popular among vegans, and is essentially used as \"vegan yogurt\".  But, if you aren't vegan, your chia pudding doesn't have to be vegan.  Chia pudding made with milk is tasty and appealing, particularly with fruit.\n\nMY RECIPE\n> For a thin yogart-like texture 2 tablespoons chia.  For pudding-like texture, 3 tablespoons chia.\n1 cup milk.  This can be cow milk, probably even half-and-half, but vegans use almond milk, soy milk, or even coconut milk.  Other reviewers claim that fruit juices can be used.\n> 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoons vanilla.\n> 1 teaspoon sugar (or agave, honey, etc.) to taste.  Stevia works well if you want to minimize the sugar.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kal-Pure-Stevia-Extract-Powder-3-5-oz/dp/B000VRSR84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kal Pure Stevia Extract Powder -- 3.5 oz</a>\n> Mix and chill overnight.  The easiest way is to use a container with a tight lid so that you can shake it once an hour for the first several hours, so that the chia seeds fully hydrate.\n\nPS: EASY TAPIOCA PUDDING.  My research on the internet revealed that tapioca pearls and pudding are two different things.  Pudding (of any kind) is simply starch.  For a 2-cup pudding mix, use 1/4 cup of tapioca pearls which have been soaking in dairy, soy or almond milk for at least 3 hours.  If you use a vanilla or coconut pudding mix that you cook until it thickens, cook the hydrated tapioca pearls with the mix.  Tapioca pearls in a vegan pudding would be vegan.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bob-s-Red-Mill-Tapioca-Small-Pearl-24-Ounce-Units-Pack-of-4/dp/B000KEJMRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bob's Red Mill Tapioca, Small Pearl, 24-Ounce Units (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Jell-O-Cook-Serve-Pudding-Pie-Filling-Coconut-3-Ounce-Boxes-Pack-of-24/dp/B000E1FXLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Jell-O Cook & Serve Pudding & Pie Filling, Coconut, 3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>&nbsp;;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bird-s-Custard-Powder-300g/dp/B000JMBE7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bird's Custard Powder 300g</a>.

At the time of this writing, Amazon offers 3 10-oz cans of Deluxe Mixed Nuts (the same product) for $10.05 (w free shipping on >$25 orders) which is a much better deal.  For the same about $20 you'd get 6 cans = 60 ozs, which would stay fresh until opened.\n\n2) The last half of the container will be stale, unless you eat the entire 40 ounces within about a week.  I repackage the nuts into about 5 1-cup size glass jars with tight tops, and refrigerate.\n\nRecommendation: After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Almonds, Whole Natural, 1.5 Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\n\"Blue Diamond Whole Natural Almonds\" are excellent unroasted and unsalted almonds.  But, if (like me) you prefer the flavor of roasted and lightly-salted almonds, they simply are not as tasty as roasted, lightly-salted almonds.\n\nMORE HEALTHY than LIGHTLY-ROASTED LIGHTLY-SALTED ALMONDS?\n\nLIGHTLY ROASTED VS UNROASTED\n> Thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.\n> Unroasted almonds (like peanuts) are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.\n> While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds do. Bitter almonds have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods. Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer. Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw. 7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child. Moreover, a child raised on raw ordinary almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) or bitter almonds bought for cooking are safe to eat---they are NOT. The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.\n\nLIGHTLY SALTED VS UNSALTED\nHumans crave salt because it is essential for human health.  True, most commercially processed foods contain salt, and if you live on high-salt commercial foods, you may be getting too much salt.  But, if you eat even moderately healthy (mostly fruits, vegetables, and fresh meat), there is nothing \"bad\" about a few salted almonds.\n\nVALUE\nBlue Diamomd roasted, salted, almonds of any variety are special: fresh, crunchy, and delicious.  However there is NOTHING special about Blue Diamond unroasted unsalted almonds.  5-pound bags of generic unsalted unroasted almonds which I bought for cooking (at BJ's) are just as flavorful, for a fraction of the price of Blue Diamond.\n\n> Click on Stoney just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nColavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 33.8 fl oz\nReview:\nQUALITY\nIn my opinion, having used a dozen or so brands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably-priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been disappointed.  Colavita is excellent quality, dependable, and reasonably priced---the perfect combination for a daily general purpose olive oil.\n\nFLAVOR\nAlthough not an \"olive oil gourmand\", I'd describe Colavita as \"rich, smooth, and neutral\". Gourmands probably have other silly terms for the flavor, such as \"fruity\" (but a \"civilian\" would never call it fruity). It is NOT harsh or bitter like most common olive oil, NOT spicy like Whole Foods 360, and NOT \"herby-fishy\".  Colavita is an evoo (\"extra virgin olive oil\"---to us non-olive oil snobs), which means \"first pressing\".  Most olive-oil nuts consider the words \"extra virgin\" to be sacred.  Practically speaking though, the mere label \"extra virgin\" is not a guarantee of quality---most grocery store brands (evoo or not) are harsh and bitter, but some are good cooking oils.\n\nPREMIUM OILS\nBotique premium oils are are as variable year to year as wines, comparably expensive, and have to be bought the way you buy fine wine (that is, ideally at tastings, where you confirm the quality and flavor before purchase).  Some are genuinely (as in NOT-gourmet-speak) buttery and nutty---great for dipping.  Some taste like the fragrance of flowers---great for salads.  Never cook premium olive oil---use it for dipping or drizzling, or on delicate salads.  Colavita is a good general purpose oil, better than most grocery store olive oil, but is not a premium oil.\n\nCOOKING OIL\nNon-extra virgin olive oils (second or later pressings) are usually darker and stronger flavored---which adds complexity to soups, sauces, stews, bean dishes etc.  If you are using a  bitter or strong-tasting olive oil, cook it WITH the dish.  I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to every sauce, soup, stew, chili, casserole, or bean dish, etc.  However, olive oil can \"go bad\"---so unless you use alot, it doesn't sense to use a different cooking oil than you use on salads, for dipping etc. Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, and therefore a good cooking oil, but probably not the best choice for a restaurant which uses large quantities of olive oil.\n\nDIPPING OIL\nTraditionally (and in the best restaurants), Italian bread, oil and balsamic vinegar is served as an appetizer.  The diner usually mixes his own oil and vinegar at the table.  If all three are top quality, the combination can be delicious, and can even be a light meal.  Add figs or slices of apple or pear and some olives, and you do have a meal. Albeit probably heresy, in fact you can substitute fine wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice.  If I don't have olives, I usually add soy sauce or Braggs for saltiness to the mixture.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bragg-Liquid-Aminos-Natural-Soy-Sauce-Alternative-32-Ounce-Bottle-Pack-of-3/dp/B001EQ4Y4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bragg Liquid Aminos, Natural Soy Sauce Alternative, 32-Ounce Bottle , (Pack of 3)</a>. Colavita is a very good \"everyday\" dipping oil.\n\nSALAD OIL\nThe requirements for an \"everyday\" salad oil are a little less stringent than that for a dipping oil, because the heavy flavor of the vinegar, and often Parmesan, bacon bits, etc. usually dominate.  However, I rarely prepare use oil and vinegar the traditional way.  For everyday salads (or as a dip for raw vegies) I prefer olive-oil based mayo with a little freshly ground pepper, and some citrus zest.  For special salads, I use a fruity premium olive oil (and just a hint of lemon and/or orange juice and zest).  Colavita is a very good \"everyday\" salad oil.\n\nDRIZZING OIL\nA drizzling oil is an oil you pour over a dish immediately before serving, or which you serve in a carafe on the table.  If you REALLY like the flavor of \"ordinary good\" olive oil (I don't)---then you will find Colavita to be a good drizzling oil.  My hispanic wife frequently drizzles Colavita on the dishes I've cooked (with Colavita), because she likes the olive-oil flavor.  By the way, the same principle applies to the use of butter, pepper, garlic, cheese, even soy sauce---if you want the flavor to dominate, add it just before serving; if you want the flavor to be subtle, cook the seasoning with the dish.  For most dishes I prefer a rich blend of subtle flavors.\n\nHEALTHY COOKING\nI go to a great deal of effort to minimize animal fat in my diet, by very strict trimming, thorough cooking, and by chilling broth to remove the solidified fat.  However, the body needs fat and craves fat.  The ideal solution is to replace animal fat with vegetable oils which are high in omega-3s.  Olive oil is ideal for the purpose.\n\nMy Southern grandmother could not cook any vegetables without a thick slice of fatback (fatty bacon)---and indeed her vegetables were very tasty.  Speaking of which, what is the point of healthy vegetables if no-one will eat them?  The solution is to add several tablespoon fulls of olive oil, and a teaspoon of chipped ham&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hormel-Premium-Real-Crumbled-Bacon/dp/B000NERTSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a>&nbsp;to the vegies.  For the best flavor, cook the vegies with the olive oil (do NOT add oil to the cooked vegetables---unless you really like the flavor of the oil).  Season as necessary with pepper and fresh lemon juice.  Truly delicious vegetables are possible---I eat them daily.\n\nECONOMY\nThe 34 ounce tins is about half the price of the bottle per oz at this time, but is expensive compared to the last time I purchased it.  The tins are small enough to use directly. But I prefer bottles, because controlling the flow of the oil is easier (since you can see the oil approaching the spout), and it is easier to gauge the amount of oil I'm using by eye (how far the level drops in the glass bottle). So, I refill bottles from the tins.  I've been told that olive oil stays fresher in tins (measured in months and years) That becomes relevant when you don't know how many months (or even years) a bottle may have sat on a grocery shelf.\n\nGENERAL RECOMMENDATION\nAfter major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.

Before pure Stevia, I used Splenda and later Truvia/Purevia (Stevia cut with bulking agents) for several years. The Truvia/Purevia were better than Splenda, but both the Splenda and Truvia/Purevia left disgusting residues and just didn't taste right (because of the fillers or bulking agents added).  More importantly for me, I could not fully enjoy my gourmet coffee with either. When I first began using pure Stevia, I appreciated the better flavor and lack of a residue, but it still did not taste quite like sugar to me. However, after 6 months of pure Stevia, it tastes like sugar to me, and I am again enjoying gourmet coffee.\n\nPerhaps more precisely, pure stevia is \"as effective\" as sugar for \"cutting the edge\" of bitter or sour drinks and foods---the way most people use sugar. However, it is not as intensely sugary-sweet, regardless of how much you use. For a rare, once-a-month \"desert\" cup of fine coffee, I still use real sugar and real cream.  Caveat: I find Splenda to be taste better in lemonade.\n\nCOMPARISON TO KAL PURE STEVIA EXTRACT\nSWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER contains the natural fiber Inulin as a bulking agent. KAL STEVIA POWDER does not.  The Inulin does not seem to affect the flavor nor leave a yucky residue (as do the nasty bulking agents in Truvia/Purevia).  Possibly due to the Inulin, SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER dissolves easier than KAL STEVIA POWDER.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pure-Stevia-Extract-Powder-3-5-oz-Powder/dp/B000VRSR84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pure Stevia Extract Powder - 3.5 oz - Powder</a>\n\nCAUTION\nInulin is a polysaccaride sometimes used as a sugar substitute itself (for diabetics).  It has about 1/4 to 1/3 the sweetness of sugar, and about 1/4 to 1/3 the caloric content---which I interpret to mean the same calories for the same sweetness (however, in this case much of the sweetness is contributed by the Stevia).  Inulin is a current food fad, with the usual (probably greatly exaggerated) claims of benefits, including improving digestion, reducing cholesterol, particularly triglycerides, protection from intestinal cancer, etc.  On the otherhand, it causes digestive problems in some people.  I suggest reading the Wikipedia article.  If (like me), you don't have digestive problems with inulin, and it sounds as though the various benefits may be significant for your particular health problems---I suggest arranging for blood tests after a month of using inulin, and a month after not using inulin to compare.  I used Sweetleaf Stevia for 6 months, and noticed no benefits, and my blood tests showed no improvement.  Perhaps coincidentally, I did nave a digestive-related problem, and my liver function was worse.  So, I returned to KAL Stevia.  Perhaps coincidentally, after three months, the digestive-related problem has not re-occured and my liver function has improved (as measured by blood tests).  I don't know if the inulin caused me any problems, but I do not believe it was any benefit.\n\nEASE OF USE\nSWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER and KAL LIQUID STEVIA are easier to measure than KAL STEVIA POWDER, because the KAL STEVIA POWDER is much more concentrated.  However, the KAL STEVIA POWDER comes with a tiny spoon which I find works perfectly well for measuring stevia for my coffee.  However, the KAL STEVIA POWDER is so concentrated that it is difficult to sprinkle over a sliced fruit dish.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pure-Stevia-Liquid-Extract-4-oz-Liquid/dp/B000W0G62E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pure Stevia Liquid Extract - 4 oz - Liquid</a>\n\nSWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER dissolves easier than KAL STEVIA POWDER.  That is not a problem for hot drinks, but SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER or KAL LIQUID are preferable for cold drinks, such as iced tea or lemonade. I also find that unsweetened fruit cups etc. are just too sour for my taste---a few drops of the KAL LIQUID STEVIA makes them perfect.\n\nECONOMY\n$15.22 for 2 4oz bottles of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER versus $18.44 for 1 3.5 oz of KAL STEVIA POWDER (the price at the time of this writing, both with free shipping on orders >$25) may seem a bargain, but the KAL STEVIA POWDER is much more concentrated.  A 3.5oz jar of KAL STEVIA POWDER claims to hold 2381 servings.  A 4oz bottle of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER claims to hold 230 servings (= 460 servings for 2 bottles).  The economy of KAL LIQUID is probably similar to SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER.\n\nI use \"3 servings\" per mug of strong coffee, so 1 bottle (3.5oz) of KAL STEVIA POWDER = 600 mugs of coffee, to my taste; while 2 bottles (8 oz) of SWEETLEAF STEVIA = 153 mugs of coffee.  So, the KAL STEVIA POWDER is clearly the winner for pure economy, but even the SWEETLEAF STEVIA is far cheaper and superior to Truvia/Purevia.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor coffee and other hot drinks, KAL POWDER is the most economical.  For cold drinks, fruit etc. SWEETLEAF POWDER (or KAL LIQUID) is more convenient.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.

No vinegar.  Only slightly salty.  With a mild nutty flavor.  To me, they most closely resemble ripe black olives---but milder.\n\nIf you like olives but are on a low-salt diet, and perhaps mostly use them in salads, or even sliced on pizza, Lindsay Olives are terrific, as is the price.

To make a dip, add a tablespoon of milk and mix.\n\nFor snacking, or as a light meal with cheese and fruit, Lindsay Pitted Ripe Green Olvies are a faint shadow of the truly wonderful genre of \"California ripe green olives\".

Can</a>.  Grabers are the Rolls Royce of ripe green olives, and are priced accordingly. About $1.50 per olive including shipping to the East Coast, perhaps $1 per olive if you buy them by the case directly from Grabers.  What's the difference?  Bigger, better olives to begin with, PITS, and careful processing.  The pits make a huge difference in any olive---they impart a nutty flavor to the flesh.

Some folks who are sensitive to caffeine, and who cannot drink other kinds of decaffeinated coffee, may be able to drink Swiss Water Process coffee.\n> That said, I find Trader Joes whole bean (also Swiss Process) decaffeinated to be acceptable.  Not great, but acceptable.\n> Surprisingly, in my opinion, Folger's decaffeinated or generic BJs decaffeinated (both ground, not whole bean, unspecified process) are better than Don Pablo or even Trader Joes whole beans.  Why go the trouble of grinding your own coffee beans if the resulting coffee isn't better?\n\n> Click on Stoney just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nLundberg Family Farms Wild Blend Rice, 16 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nGREAT RICE\n> Of all the Lundberg rice blends, this is by far my favorite.  It has a rich nutty flavor and is a good source of fiber.\n> However, in my opinion, it is better with a higher ratio of wild rice, so I mix half-a-bag of wild rice&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Lundberg-Organic-Wild-Rice-8-Ounce-Pouches-Pack-of-6/dp/B001EO5OMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Lundberg Organic Wild Rice, 8-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;to each bag of the \"Blend\".\n> You can also make your own custom blends with various Lundberg rices.\n> Ca $20 for 6 bags, w free shipping on orders >$25 (the price at the time of this writing) is a good deal.\n\nThe only problem is that it is more difficult to cook than ordinary white rice.  Oddly, most published rice cooking instructions (for white or brown rice) produce wet undercooked rice for me.  The following is my formula which works just right for any brown rice.  It produces firm dry, but fully cooked, rice, which is particularly ideal for mixing with cooked meat and/or vegetables (e.g., stir fry) or adding to soups immediately before serving.  To cook white rice, just alter the time to 15--20 minutes.\n\nCOOKING INSTRUCTIONS\n1) add 1 1/2 cups of water to an uncovered 2 1/2 quart sausepan\n2) on HIGH bring the water to a boil, in the meantime measure 1 cup of rice.\n3) as soon as the water begins to boil, turn the stove OFF (or take the pot off the burner), add the rice, and stir*\n4) set the stove burner to LOW, set a timer for 30-40 minutes, and cover\n5) when the timer goes off, immediately remove from the stove, uncover, stir and \"fluff up\" the rice with a plastic spatula, and leave uncovered for 1/2 hour.\n6) after a half-hour, cover the rice until time to eat it.\n\n*If you simply dump rice into a pot of boiling water, and slap a lid on it, it will boil over and make a mess---you need to let the burner (particularly if ceramic) and pot (particular if heavy) cool down a little before you put the lid on.  The quickest and easiest way is to simply turn the burner off for the few seconds it takes to stir in the rice.\n\nDO NOT SUBSTITUTE BROTH FOR THE WATER; DO NOT ADD BUTTER OR OIL---you'll almost certainly get wet, undercooked, rice.  If you want to add flavor, add olive oil or butter, and Braggs Aminos or bullion AFTER the rice is fully cooked.  Yes, I know lotsa folks like to do this with white rice, me too.  It just doesn't work for this brown rice.\n\nCAUTION\nOn my glass-top (Kitchen Aide) range, I've found that I cannot cook ANYTHING simultaneously with the rice.  If the oven or ANY other burner is in use (or if the stove is merely warm from recent use), the temperature sensing circuitry of the range turns off the burner with the rice, with the result that the rice is undercooked.\n\nSALVAGING UNDERCOOKED RICE\nYou can't just put the rice back on the burner---you'll get glop.  Assuming that you started with 1 cup of dry rice:  Pack the rice into a 24oz covered casserole, for example&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Marinex-23-7-Ounce-Small-Round-Casserole-with-Lid/dp/B0016MZPII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Marinex 23.7-Ounce Small Round Casserole with Lid</a>&nbsp;and microwave for 5 minutes.  The result will be PERFECT rice.  Really!!!  IT REALLY WORKS!!!\n\nCOOKING IN A MICROWAVE\nAdd 1 cup dry rice and 1/2 cup water to a 24oz covered casserole, microwave 5 minutes(at \"low\" or half-power).  Add another 1/2 water, microwave 5 minutes(at \"low\" or half-power).  Add the third 1/2 cup water and microwave 5 minutes(at \"low\" or half-power).\n\nGeneral Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.\n\n> Click on Stoney just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Gluten Free Buckwheat Groats, 16 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nPROS\n> Cooks in only 10 minutes.\n> Ridiculously easy to cook.

It arrived to me quickly and in fresh condition from Amazon.\n\nOrganic Mekong Flower Rice(tm) - Cambodia's Floral Brown Rice, Imported from Cambodia\n\nMekong Flower is called 'Phka Malis' in Khmer, which means beautiful garland of flowers, because of its delicate floral aroma. Leaving the germ and bran layer intact intensifies its fragrance and nutty flavor while retaining the highest nutritional value. This nourishing whole grain rice has a lovely supple texture - unlike the chewy and bland taste of some brown rice.\n\nPerfect in dishes that will showcase its delicate fragrance, Mekong Flower is nutritious and flavorful.\n\nPerfect for all cuisines, it can be used steamed plain, in a pilaf, stir-fry, salad or pudding.\n\nMekong Flower is chiefly grown on small family plots by households belonging to the Damrei Romeal Organic Rice Cooperatives in Takeo, a province dominated by rice fields and sugar palm trees. Cooperative members are using a set of growing methods, called the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), which enable smallholder farmers to harvest more rice from their traditional varieties using less water, seed, land and no chemicals. Researchers have found that the major aromatic compound in rice is increased in response to water stress. With SRI, farmers drain their paddies periodically, which may explain why Cambodian consumers are saying that SRI-grown 'Phka Malis' is more aromatic and better tasting. Visit our SRI section to learn more about this amazing system that is transforming the rice-growing world.\n\n# Cooks in 30 minutes\n# Whole grain and heart healthy\n# High in fiber, trace minerals and vitamins\n# High in phytonutrients and antioxidants\n# 3rd year transition, organic certification\n# Fair trade\n# Gluten and wheat free\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I have their coconut oil and coconut manna, and in all my years of cooking/eating experience, these are the cream of the crop for taste and quality. I've tried a lot of coconut and been disappointed, let's just say that.\n\nThese are chips and not shreds, and at first I was a bit at a loss about what I'd use them for. But then I made 'granola cereal' from them. We are grain-free so I followed a recipe that uses nuts and seeds and coconut to simulate a granola cereal. I can't even begin to describe the exquisite contribution this coconut made to the dish! When toasted it couldn't have tasted more like fresh coconut. It had a sweet, soft bite. I've since toasted them and used them on garnish on full-sugar cake and cupcakes that I've made for others. This goes WAY beyond generic \"Angel Flake Coconut\" you find in the store. This makes it look like you made it yourself.\n\nI will buy this again and again!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Extract, with gift box, 8 ounces\nReview:\nI have tried what seems like every type of vanilla out there, and this is simply my favorite for all applications.

(Forget the claims of 2x strength, it's really not as good as the Nielsen-Massey) This brand has been my favorite for 15 years.\n\nNormally I bought this at Williams-Sonoma, but was pleased to find it MUCH cheaper on Amazon!

I found the grind size to be just right for my microwave muffins. We are doing low carb and this coconut product is very versatile for so many recipes. it's about rice-sized.\n\nIf you want coconut flour just run this through your food processor or coffee grinder (not one you make coffee beans in) and you have instant flour for thickening or coating or recipes.\n\nI recently discovered this coconut product is ideal to make coconut shrimp! Just use this instead of flour in your egg/flour wash before you fry your shrimp. Watch carefully as it browns in a hurry! Pulse some coconut with some peanut flour (Protein Plus or PB2) and use that as your dredge, it makes THE crispiest, sweetest coating!\n\nIt goes from brown to burned in seconds so keep the heat low and slow. Stir a lot.\nIf you have liquid Splenda you can make a mock Angel Flake coconut with it!

Luckily it arrived in time for my cake needs.\n\nIt was easy to color with gel paste, and easy to blend. I was afraid of streaks but it worked well. It rolled out easily on my mat, but be warned you really need to sprinkle on the powdered sugar before you try to roll it onto your roller to put it on the cake. If you are used to fondant that doesn't stick to itself very much, trust me on this. I had to re-roll it.  Overall it went onto my cake smoothly, but it split in a couple of places and the repair job was NOT easy. (It was still obvious)  By the time I put the fondant onto my cake and trimmed the excess (nevermind started to do the crack repairs) the remainder was already dry and cracking. It didn't keep moisture very long so keep that in mind also. my leftovers will have to be sculptural items and not re-rolled onto a cake.\n\nIt smells like cheap marshamallows but I have to agree with someone else that said it tastes better than Wilton; Wilton tastes like ground up mummified mice to me, just old and dusty and dirty. This isn't as delicious as homemade fondant, but I've had much worse than the Satin Ice.\n\nI may get three cakes out of this bucket. To me that's not economical enough to buy it again, I'll make my own from now on. It more or less served a purpose for a cake I was making, but it's not a repurchase for me.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nOliveNation Szechuan Peppercorns 8 oz.\nReview:\nI ordered an 8 oz. package of peppercorns...wow, just wow...that is a LOT of peppercorns.

My only reservation is with the kidney beans.  I was able to cook them until they were tender, but the skin or outer layer of the beans remained tough and chewy.  Not inedible, just chewier than I felt they should be.  Everything else in the mix was good.  I brought 4 cups of chicken broth to a boil, then added a cup of the soup mix and a cup of pasta shells... brought it to a boil again, covered the pot, then let it simmer for about 30 minutes (it was a low simmer).  The veggies added more flavor to the chicken broth, and I didn't have to add any other seasonings (though you could).  Next time, I'll use vegetable broth for more of a \"minestrone\" flavor -- might also try to slow cooker method.\n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with the product and would definitely order from Harmony House again.  As a matter of fact, I'm kind of eyeballing their dehydrated cabbage. Mmmm, cabbage soup...\n\nIf you're cooking for one or two people, like I am, this is nice change of pace from a can of condensed soup.  You can make just enough for one, or a huge pot for a small army.  You control the ratio of broth to veggies, you can add leftover chicken, pasta, rice... and not have to chop veggies all morning.\n\nOh, I should also mention (my own preference), I specifically chose this soup mix because it had no peppers (green or red) and contained cabbage.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLean Cuisine, Marketplace, Butternut Squash Ravioli, 9.875 oz (Frozen)\nReview:\nI really liked this. Delicious taste to me. The ravioli was a bit chewy, but still good. There was a carrot stick that was rough and hard I had to toss, but the rest was perfect. Maybe that carrot piece was overcooked in the microwave. The butternut squash in the ravioli had a slightly sweet taste, I found to be very pleasant. There isn't much sauce, but it's enough to make the meal tasty. The snap peas were excellent. I'm adding this easy meal to my usual selections.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPepperidge Farm, Milano, Cookies, Dark Chocolate, 15 oz., Multi-pack, Tub, 20-count\nReview:\nVey good and fresh.

I have difficulty finding Cream of Broccoli at my local stores, and since no one else in the family will eat the stuff, a single-serving container works best for me. As for flavor: I find a bit more bland than their standard condensed version, but it's not bad.  One thing that really keeps me from giving it more than 3 stars is the amount of \"broccoli wood\" I have to spit out.  I think they use a lot of stalk in making this soup. So... yeah... \"okay flavor\", but cream of broccoli is one of my favorite soups, and the convenience factor is nice.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Packets, 100 Count\nReview:\nI like Splenda, but to be honest, I usually just buy whatever \"generic\" version is on sale... unless Splenda is on sale, then I'll go ahead and get that.

I've had nearly all the canned varieties of chili out there, and while most are okay as fixin's for chilidogs, or adjusted with cheese, crackers, ketchup, fritos, etc...  This one actually tastes good \"as is\".  I don't even grab the crackers.  I'm not even a big fan of chili, but I've eaten these twice a week since I bought them. I'll definitely reorder this one.

I have used ghee in the past, but never kept it on hand all the time. I think this one is a keeper. Buttery and wonderful. This is great for cooking. I used it to cook some stuffed Indian eggplants tonight. It is also good for honey butter chicken. You can use this to saute or fry. I even give a tiny bit to my dogs once in a while. This is a healthy fat that is a way better option than soybean, canola, or corn oil.\n\nGhee is meant to have a long shelf life, so I do not refrigerate it as it becomes too difficult to work with.

Bag &mdash; Organic, Non-GMO, Sun-Dried, Sulfite-Free\nReview:\nI originally purchased a tiny amount  of Goji berries for my chinchillas to see if they would like them. One of them really loves them, so I wanted to buy more. Buying a one pound bag from Amazon was much cheaper than buying four ounces from the chinchilla place. They taste very good. A bit chewy and a tiny bit tart. I don't usually add fruit to my homemade granola, but I will definitely be using some of these berries as well as Navitas Naturals cacao nibs in my next batch.\n\nThe bag is easy to open and also seals shut without issue.

The only complaint I have is that it is a little pricey, but it is worth it for something so tasty and healthy.\n\nJust one more note, you sometimes see coconut water in cans.

The purples had a nice flavor, and I'd rate the purple as a 5 star product, although IN MY OPINION, the others weren't as good.\n\n*** on another side note, I gave this gummy candy to others, and many of them actually said that this was better than the Haribo, and they liked the fact that this was chewier. so, just because it isn't to my liking doesn't mean that this isn't a five star product. it's all a matter of preference I guess.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nAlbanese Pineapple Gummi Bears, 5 Pound Bags (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nMany people that tried these did not like them at all. I kept them in a clean oversized container, and when I opened them up to hand out, there was a smell which smelled like something was rotten. After the first 3 seconds or so, it smells like a nice artificial pineapple smell. Not one of my favorites made byAlbanese, and many others that tried the other flavors agreed. They do have a distinct pineapple taste though.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nYumEarth Organic Ginger Zest Drops, 3.3 Ounce Pouches (Packaging May Vary) (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nthese are organic.

The corn I speak of isn't a corn you'd want to eat because this type of corn has been sprayed with disgusting pesticides etc. Essentially, this is what candies are made of. They are labeled as several different names you wouldn't recognize, but mostly you'll see high fructose corn syrup. Knowing this, I went out and bought the variety pack of this candy as a healthy substitute.  I must honestly say that a few of the flavors really were disgusting, and I immediately spit them out. I was giving bags away. Curiosity got the best of me though, and I wanted to know what the ginger flavor tasted like. YUMMY! spicy and sweet! I was hooked and have been buying this candy ever since.

I make my first cup of the morning by using one k-cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k-cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K-cup. It still holds a robust flavor but just not as heavily as the first, which is what I like to do after drinking sev'l cups.  I use cream & sugar, so this routine works for me.

I bought these at Sam's, for half the price, so FYI.  The expiration date is 3 months from now, early Dec.  I don't think these items ever are more than 3 months expiration.  That is the nature of the beast.  It cannot last months and months up to a year b/c it is real dairy. If you get these with an expiration time frame of 2 or so months to use up, as others have 'complained' of, then you are in the ballpark.

I also like the taste of lemon. I may not be a bonafide tea drinker, but I know what I like. That being said, upon receiving a sample box of Canarino and having a cough/cold this week, I tried the Canarino instead of my usual go-to green tea. I loved it! What a nice change of pace. It wasn't bitter whatsoever to my taste. I sipped it w/o honey or sugar. I used the 8oz. serving cup size, just fine. It was smooth and light and kept my throat moist and was very comforting. It reminded me of Thera-flu w/out all the added medicinals.

She had her first Reese's peanut butter cup on her last day, her graduation day, she swooned.  I found out later they came in DARK chocolate, and we all love dark vs milk chocolate, so this was a no brainer. It came today and it is just right.  I love the soft creamy bite you get.  I had previously purchased buckeyes in dark chocolate which basically are a peanut creamy center like this, but shaped like a truffle.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the same thing I was hoping for.  The top of the 'buckeye' has a harder piece of lighter chocolate \"the eye\" and I always removed it bc I like the softer bite you get from Reese's.  It's a personal preference, but that's how all our food preferences are.  And this one is mine.  I can't wait to share it with my granddaughter when I see her this weekend.  She will like these even more now!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCento Tomato Puree, 28-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI am a Baby Boomer and my mom taught me years back how to make Italian sauce. She used Progresso Puree then, I can't find it anymore.  I then made sauce of my own creation and touches, and altho' I get raves about it, I felt it needed something.  I find that adding a good puree to your main sauce using whole plum tomatoes is 'the secret sauce' to good Italian sauce.  It thins out the pour of the sauce without it being loose and runny. Without the balance of thick to creamy in a sauce, it is either too clumpy and gloppy or too runny. I like that the ingredient list has ONE ingredient:  VINE RIPENED TOMATOES.  You can't get more straightforward than that. When I make other dishes other than Italian style--Indian for instance--or even stuffed cabbage which also needs a base of tomato sauce--this is good to use bc there is no added herbs or seasonings to make it lean one way or the other.  I don't need basil or anything in my sauce bc I can add it myself.  It makes the sauce start out with a clean slate so to speak, ready for whatever you need to turn it into to be distinctive to that dish.  I order it by the case from Amazon, and it comes out to less than $2 a can.  I have tried other Italian brands of canned tomato products that I like, but even some of their purees are not to my liking, they are not as fresh tasting as this is.  It is also a product of Italy.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEden Organic Kamut Elbows, 100% Whole Grain, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI like this one and the Eden Kamut ditalini--tastes as good as the best of them.

I've noticed lately that some of their products have deteriorated in quality, i.e., baby wipes, bath tissues, to name a couple.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHungarian Sweet Paprika, 5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI was in the middle of making chicken paprikash and noticed that my can of Szeged Sweet Paprika was getting low. When I checked my last purchase on Amazon it was no longer available from that vendor. I paid $8.40 for a 5 oz. can, which really turned out to be fortunate for me -- I frantically started checking for another vendor of Hungarian Paprika and came across this terrific bargain. Even though Prime doesn't apply to this, I'm only paying $30.00 for 6 cans. Since I use 1/4 cup per recipe, I'll probably go through that amount fairly quickly.\n\nImported to the US directly from Kalocsa Paprika Ltd., Kalocsa, this Szeged Sweet Paprika is an absolute necessity if you plan on making authentic Hungarian Chicken Paprikash.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTorani Sugar Free Syrup, Coconut, 33.8 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThe product is great. I really enjoy the brown sugar and cinnamon in my oatmeal and have been using it for quite some time now. Each time I purchased it in the past it was sold and shipped by Amazon at $23.91 for 3 bottles. Torani, in most flavors, is sold locally at $4.99 for a 33.8 oz. bottle. Unfortunately, none of the local stores have started carrying this flavor yet, so I figured that paying Amazon $7.97 per bottle shipped with my Prime wasn't such a bad deal. Now Amazon has a third party selling it for $29.65 per 3 bottles, plus $8.91 for shipping. $12.85 per bottle is just a little more than I'm willing to pay for something I can order directly from the Torani people.\n\nUpdate: 09/23/2013:\nSellers may actually pay attention to reviews **SURPRISE** as the price for this product came down from $29.65 yesterday to $24.99 + shipping @ $13.75 today. Too late, though, since I purchased it directly from Torani yesterday for $22.05 + shipping @ $6.95.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nNuSci Aspartame Pure Powder 227 grams (8.0 oz) Low Calorie Sweetener\nReview:\nThis is really wonderful. I have been using it in drinks, tea, coffee and anything else that I want sweetened, including cooking with it. I mix it in my oatmeal before microwaving -- so delicious. Up until now I've been using Equal, but its first ingredient is Dextrose w/Maltodextrin (sugar) which, in my opinion, defeats the purpose of using it. Can't tell the difference between using the pure Aspartame powder or using Equal.\n\nThe only thing I wish NuSci would do is to pack it directly in a glass or plastic jar. It takes some dexterity to transfer from the plastic package. It is so much easier to use by \"spooning\" it out of a jar. As for the packaging itself, I must admit is excellent. The powder is in a heavy plastic zipped bag with the label on it, which is then placed into another heavy zipped plastic bag.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEqual 0 Calorie Sweetener, Granulated 4 oz (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nI notice that a number of people giving a one-star rating say it is not as sweet as what is in Equal packets. The reason for that may be because Equal packets contain Dextrose, Maltodextrin, Aspartame and Acesulfame Potassium. Equal Spoonful contains Maltodextrin, Aspartame, Acesulfame Potassium -- it doesn't have Dextrose in it. Dextrose is sugar (actually a simple sugar) which also helps dissolve the product more quickly.\n\nIn the past I have purchased pure Aspartame from Amazon (NuSci Aspartame Pure Powder 227 grams (8.0 oz) Low Calorie Sweetener) which is quite difficult to dissolve and it too has a different taste. However, it's good if you want plain Aspartame.\n\nI have been using Equal for  50 years and for the information of anyone terrified of Aspartame, I don't have any of the diseases with which quacks insist on threatening people who do use it.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nYork Sugar Free Peppermint Patties Dark Chocolate Covered Mint Candy, 3 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nMaltitol, Lactitol, Isomalt and Sorbitol -- the sugar substitutes used in this product can be pure poison to some individuals.  I am one of those people.  Granted, the makers of this product warn it can have a laxative effect (that's from the above-mentioned sugar substitutes, not the product itself), but some of us go way beyond experiencing a laxative effect to debilitating diarrhea even with moderate consumption of cookies or candies made with these sugar substitutes.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nSzeged Hungarian Paprika, Sweet, 5 Ounce\nReview:\nI am cleaning out my spice cabinet and came across this identical can of Szeged Rose Paprika at the very back. The only difference I can see between mine and the picture on here is the top. Mine is white with 3 ways to open -- sift, spoon or pour -- and all are very difficult to open. This can is very old, decades, and I was trying to figure out why it is still here. I suppose it's nostalgia because I certainly wasn't using it. Occasionally over the years I have tried to find this product and couldn't. I decided to Google it and arrived here. After reading the reviews, I realize why it wasn't being used. It is a very dark red and has a bitter, not sweet, taste. I have purchased other brands and been disappointed. None of them met the standards of the one my mother used which is why I kept trying to find this brand, hoping I just got a bad batch. I am going to purchase a can and see what I end up with this time.\n\nBTW, no bugs and if there were, they certainly would have had decades to do their thing.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nRoasted Unsalted Jumbo Peanuts, Blanched, 5 Pound Bulk Bag - We Got Nuts\nReview:\nThese peanuts are perfect.

These will be the right size to use in my Microwave Peanut Brittle.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Arrowhead Mills Organic Buckwheat Groats, 24-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nBeat an egg into 1 cup of the buckwheat groats, place it in a dry pan that has been heated over medium or slightly higher heat. Stir constantly until the buckwheat is toasted to suit you. The egg coats the kernels and keeps them from sticking together while cooking. Bring 2 cups of chicken broth to a boil (water or vegetable broth if you don't eat meat) along with 2 Tbsp. of chicken fat (I always save some fat when I cook a chicken) or oil, salt, and ground pepper if you like. Add the buckwheat to the hot broth, stir and let it come back to a boil, then reduce heat to the lowest setting. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or till the liquid is absorbed.\n\nDice a medium size onion, do the same with about 1/2 pound of white or brown mushrooms, crush 2 cloves of garlic (it must have garlic...:-). Mix these ingredients together while you heat another pan containing about 2 Tbsp. chicken fat (or oil) and saute the mixture, adding salt, and pepper.\n\nStir the two mixtures together and enjoy.\n\nYum, it tastes just the way my mother used to make Kasha.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Kasha / Roasted Buckwheat, 18 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI just sent this to the place where I buy bulk foods:\n\n\"I have not yet purchased this product from Honeyville, but I read the 3 reviews. One said the seeds were broken up... not good. I originally bought a 30# bag locally and all the seeds are perfect in shape and well toasted. This makes wonderful Kasha, but I am gradually running out and need to locate a new source to purchase.\n\nIs the Buckwheat from Honeyville toasted, is it raw? And are some of the seeds truly broken up?\n\nI don't know how to rate this as I have never yet purchased anything from Bob's Red Mill.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['product', 'using', 'sugar', 'amazon', 'oz', 'really', 'aspartame', 'people', 'even', 'cup']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa, 26 Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI just received this today and started cooking with it.  I've used other brands of quinoa and Bob's is as good as any I've ever used, if not better.  The flavor is plain and you can add your own spices.  This could be used as a breakfast cereal or as a dinner side dish.  I am on a diet to avoid the white stuff - white potatoes, white rice, white pasta, and white flour because of health concerns.  This is a welcome tasty addition to my new diet.\n\nI cooked mine in the microwave like I do with rice, but it did not require as much time to absorb the water.  One cup quinoa with 1 cup water, and less than 10 minutes on high with cook it up nice and fluffy.  Microwaves are all different, so your timing will depend on your microwave's power.  Mine is a low 800 watt compact microwave, and like I said, it was done in less than 10 minutes.\n\nMy local market carries Bob's products, but not this quinoa.  One small box of quinoa costs about 2 times what I paid on subscribe and save.  I've stored the unused unopened bags in my freezer for save keeping so they don't turn rancid before I use them, but I think I will be eating a lot of this, so I don't think it will have a chance to get rancid anyway.  It tends to fill you up, so a little goes a long way.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Preparation was easy and fast. I did not have any issues with it spilling in my microwave, or coming out \"soupy\" and unevenly cooked. The gluten free rice macaroni was actually better than expected, and the cheese sauce came out well after letting the product sit for a minute. Unfortunately, there's no getting past the cardboard taste. It doesn't make the Pastariso Instant Rice Mac and Cheese Meal Cup inedible, but it makes it just bad enough to not recommend it.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBarilla Organic Pasta, Spaghetti &amp; Penne, 16 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nBarilla Organic Pasta, Spaghetti & Penne is made from certified USDA Organic ingredients, and contains no GMO ingredients.

I enjoyed it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWholesome Organic Pancake Syrup, Non GMO, 20 fl oz (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nWholesome Sweeteners Organic Pancake Syrup is a good tasting pancake syrup, but the best part is that it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup. Honestly, I have no idea how much healthier organic cane sugar syrup really is, but I do know how bad high fructose corn syrup is. My doctor calls it  \"evil\". On his advice,  I've eliminated most of it from my diet, and lost 20 pounds in 6 months. I feel better too.\n\nWholesome Sweeteners Organic Pancake Syrup is a nice thick syrup, almost the consistency of maple syrup. It isn't quite as good as maple syrup though, but I didn't expect it to be. It does tatse better than the usual store bought syrups, but also costs about twice as much. It costs less per ounce than maple syrup though. I like Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Pancake Syrup, and will use it in the future.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCommunity Coffee Ground Coffee, Breakfast Blend, (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nCommunity Coffee Ground Coffee \"Breakfast Blend\" is a very good medium roast coffee made with 100% Arabica coffee beans. I generally do not like dark roasts, especially the blends found at most popular chain coffee houses. I also find light roasts to be bland and/or weak, so medium roasts are my blend of choice. Community Coffee Breakfast Blend  definitely falls in the category of medium roast, and I like it a lot. While there isn't anything really distinctive about the taste, it's just good coffee. If I had to compare it to another coffee, to me it tastes similar to McDonald's Premium Roast Coffee, which to me is also very good. Community Coffee Breakfast Blend isn't bitter. It's somewhat mellow but not weak, and very smooth. Medium roast fans should really like it. Light and dark roast drinkers probably won't hate it either.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nACUTEfruit 8x24 Tropical Blast, 8-Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nACUTEfruit Tropical Blast is non-carbonated fruit blend energy drink that unlike most energy drinks contains 50% fruit juice and only 70 calories. It also contains 3g of Fiber, and is loaded with B Vitamins. ACUTEfruit Tropical Blast  gets it's energy mostly from the small amount of caffeine (47mg) from Guarana and Yerba Mate. It does not provide the jolt that the mega caffeine, high sugar energy drinks provide. This can be a positive or a disappointment depending on what you're expecting. There is no \"crash\" after drinking ACUTEfruit Tropical Blast which is a major plus. Taste wise, I find the apple and orange juice combination to pleasant enough. I find canned orange juice to always have a strange taste with an almost medicine like after taste, and ACUTEfruit Tropical Blast has a little bit of that. The apple juice does a pretty good job of masking it though.\n\nI like ACUTEfruit Tropical Blast. It gives me the same boost as a cup of coffee despite having less caffeine, and the ingredients are somewhat healthier than the average energy drink.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nEight O'Clock Coffee, Original Ground, 12-Ounce Bag (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nEveryone has different tastes, but Eight O'Clock is my favorite coffee.

Both are excellent coffees, and moderately priced.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBalance Bar, Chocolate Caramel Peanut Nougat, 1.41 ounce bars 6 count, Chocolate Caramel Peanut Nougat Nutrition Bar\nReview:\nBalance Chocolate Peppermint Patty, 1.41 ounce bars are chewy candy bar like snacks that taste quite good, but I'm not a fan of the very chewy like texture. The bars are gluten and wheat free, and contain slightly less calories, sugar, and fat than a standard candy bar. They also contain some fiber too. Price wise, they cost about twice as much as a candy bar. In the end, Balance Chocolate Peppermint Patty, 1.41 ounce bars aren't bad. I can see people really enjoying them is they want a chewy candy bar like snack. To me though, I was expecting something a little different than what tastes like just another candy bar.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nMaxwell House Master Blend Ground Coffee, 11.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nMaxwell House Coffee \"South Pacific Blend\" is an excellent medium-dark roast blend. If you like Maxwell House Coffee \"Original Blend\", then you'll probably like \"South Pacific Blend\". In fact, they taste almost the same to me. The only real difference is that the \"South Pacific Blend\" is a slightly darker roast. I've never seen Maxwell House Coffee \"South Pacific Blend\" in my local stores, so it may be hard to find other than online. I recommend trying it if you get a chance, as long as you enjoy original Maxwell House, and like a medium-dark roast.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSnack Factory Pretzel Crisps, Original, 7.2 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nSnack Factory Organic Pretzel Crisps are a tasty snack that are excellent for dipping.

Other than that, I really like them.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nQuaker Instant Oatmeal Original, 12 Packets per Box (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nQuaker Instant Oatmeal Apples & Cinnamon is a great oatmeal.

Of course, the tin is what attracted me to the product but then I got hooked on the burst of peppermint in my mouth. There is something so old world soothing about opening the tin, gently parting the thin foldover paper, and choosing just one mint, refolding the paper and snapping the tin shut.  I've never gotten tired of that experience.\n\nAltoids, the curiously strong mints, have not changed their recipe in over 200 years, using only natural flavors.  The explosion of peppermint when placed on the tongue is truly a treat which I'll never be without.  Refreshing experience from such a little lozenge.\nAnd a delightful refresher after a meal without adding but a couple of calories.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHarney &amp; Sons Caffeinated Hot Cinnamon Sunset Black Tea with Orange and Cloves Tin 20 Sachets\nReview:\nThis is a wonderful cinnamon spice flavored tea which is caffeinated.  I prefer the caffeinated for mornings and an herbal tea in the evenings.  I ran across the Sunset tea at my local Walmart at about half the price of Amazon so I purchased a tin of 20.  The bags are mesh in a pyramid shape, giving full brewing access to the tea.  I normally use a half teaspoon of honey in my teas but this particular tea doesn't require any extra sweetner.\n\nI find that the tea bag is strong enough to brew a double cup as 8 oz. of water is just too little and makes quite a potent brew.  I keep an extensive variation of teas to suit my mood but find that this Harney and Sons Hot Cinnamon Sunset is one of my go to flavors.  As an added plus, the kitchen smells wonderful while the cup is steeping.  Even my husband comments on how good it smells and he's not a tea drinker.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMrs. Dash, Seasoning Blend, Onion &amp; Herb, 2.5 Ounce\nReview:\nThis product by Mrs. Dash is one of the better salt free blends in the product line.  I use several Mrs. Dash items and like to switch up the seasonings.  Too much pepper bothers me and this one particular blend doesn't have as much pepper in it as some other Mrs. Dash products although pepper is the third ingredient listed.  The onion and herb flavors are not over powering but of course, can be strengthened with a heavier application of it.\n\nMy household is not on a salt restriction diet but as we get older we try to cut down on it and the Mrs. Dash products give us lots of flavor without the salt, which then we use so much more sparingly.  I find the Onion and Herb flavors compliment pork really well and I like to use it on our vegetables.  We keep three of the Mrs. Dash mixtures on our spice shelf, the original being the most used.  It's a very good product that enhances the flavors of grilled meats and veggies.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKeebler Club Crackers Original, 13.7 Oz. (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nA salad or a bowl of soup is just not complete without Keebler Club Crackers.  We have eaten these crackers for many years now and after trying out several brands and store brands, always come back to Keebler.  They are so light and tender with a buttery flavor and seem to just melt in our mouths.\n\nI always have a box on hand and they stay fresh and crisp.  I roll down the top on a partially used sleeve of the crackers and gently put a rubber band lengthwise on it.  This has always worked, even in the hot humid summers. Keebler club crackers may cost a little more but are totally worth the extra expense.\n\nThese in no way resemble a saltine, which have their own place in the kitchen.  Yummy good.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBetty Crocker, Muffin Mix, Authenic Cornbread &amp; Muffin Mix, 6.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nBetty Crocker cornbread mix is by far the best mix that I've found.  Most of the mixes I've tried are much too sweet and we don't care for a heavy sweetness when paired with ham and beans or homemade vegetable soup.  It is super easy as it only requires three ingredients to be added, milk, egg and butter.  It turns out light and tender and rises very well.  It has that wonderful cornbread taste that so many of the other mixes are lacking. I've tried many recipes through the years and have not found one that is better than this mix,  the recipes make way too much anyway and I have to throw the leftovers out for the birds.\n\nI have a small cast iron skillet that I bake this in as it seems to be the perfect size and as the pan is old and well seasoned, the cornbread pops out without sticking.  I've also made muffins and cornbread sticks with it.  Actually it depends on what we're having with it that determines what pan I'll use.  The envelope makes just the right amount for the two of us and with enough left over for another meal.  If you have more than three or four in your family, you'll probably need to use two packets.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTone's Minced Onion - 15 oz shaker\nReview:\nI have had a large container of Tone's dried minced onion in my pantry supplies for years now and am constantly reaching for them.  If I'm making a big pot of soup or stew I'll use fresh onions but for small jobs, the dried onions are indispensable.  I love to put them in my tuna or chicken salads as they reconstitute with the available ground up sweet pickle juices and make a much nicer consistency of salads.\n\nI find that the onion flavor is milder than fresh onions but that is one of the reasons why I like to use them, they're not overpowering.  And I really don't like the crunch of freshly chopped onion in my sandwiches and I hardly know they're in the recipe except for the subtle flavor.  These are also great to mix with ground beef when grilling hamburgers for when I don't have any fresh onions on hand to slice.\n\nI find that they never spoil and keep their flavor indefinitely which is a big money saver as fresh onions can turn on me quite quickly no matter how I store them.  This large size container is so much more economical than a small bottle off the spice shelf. They reconstitute quickly in a little warm water if I should want to plump them up before using.  Great product!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHidden Valley Original Ranch Seasoning and Salad Dressing Mix, 16 Ounce\nReview:\nIf you are like me and use Hidden Valley Ranch and Seasoning mix in much of your cooking, then this 16 oz. container is the only way to go.  I have found such a wide range of uses that are enhanced with this seasoning mix.  To name a few; our hearty Taco Soup that is a go to in the winter, sprinkled on cubed potatoes that are then oven browned, sprinkled over baked potatoes, sprinkled on popcorn, sprinkled on steamed broccoli and green beans, mixed with sour cream or plain yogurt for a tasty dip, the applications are as endless as your imagination.  And on occasion I do actually make a dressing for salads with this!  So simple and fresh tasting. I used to only buy the envelopes but as I found the bountiful ways to use it, I had to go with the bulk containers.  As I cannot find this larger container in my local Walmart, Amazon provides a great and economical place to get it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKnorr Rice Side Dish, Cheddar Broccoli, 5.7 oz, Pack of 12\nReview:\nTo my way of thinking Knorr's Taco Rice is one of their best products.  The flavor is great, not too spicy nor too salty.  When cooked, which doesn't take but 7 or 8 minutes, each kernel stays separated, not gummed together.  This holds true even when cold.  If you prefer a little more seasoning, then you're free to add a little more taco seasoning on your own.\n\nI was beating my head against the pantry door one night trying to think of something very easy to fix and yet with substance and flavor.  I pulled out a packet of this Taco Rice and just happened to glance at the back.  There was a recipe for Taco Vegetable Pie.  I had the ground beef, the diced tomatoes, cheese and tortillas.  Oh Boy.\n\nThe recipe called for the addition of frozen mixed vegetables which I didn't have but my husband wouldn't have like them added anyway.  All it was consisted of was browning the ground beef and adding the drained diced tomatoes and a spoonful of chili seasoning but I used extra taco seasoning instead as we like that flavor.  Fixing the rice as directed I then layered a third of the beef mixture, a third of the rice and a fourth cup of grated cheddar cheese and to finish the layer, a tortilla. Repeat this process for another layer and end up with the beef, rice and cheese on top.  Bake at 350 until heated through.  20 or 25 min.  Serve with chopped lettuce or sour cream.\n\nThis was simply delicious and a nice reprieve from my husband's regular meat and potatoes.  The left overs heated very nicely so this made two meals for us.\n\nI make a Texas skillet with gr. beef, rice, kidney beans, mushrooms, cheese, tomato sauce and lots of chili powder and this Taco Rice will make a wonderful substitute for the plain minute rice.\n\nThe rice used in this Knorr package is more like whole grain rice and keeps a good solid texture to is that is so much more appetizing than a faster rice.  I think the application of this rice in recipes would be endless.  Knorr really hit a home run with this particular rice mix.  I know that I will always keep a supply of this Taco Rice on hand because it can be used so many ways.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nChef Boyardee Pizza Sauce with Cheese, 15 oz, 12 Pack\nReview:\nI was first introduced to pizza around 1960 when the Chef Boyardee Pizza kits came out.  I thought it was the most wonderful thing created but I can remember my dad hating the \"stinky\" smell of the Parmesan cheese as it baked.\n\nI've tried other pizza sauces down through the years and have found a couple that are acceptable but none is as good as the Chef Boyardee sauce.  After many years, the company started selling the sauce in a can by itself.  This was great as I didn't like to have to buy the whole kit, preferring different cheese adorning my pizzas.\n\nThere is no other taste quite like this sauce.  It's thick and rich and savory, complementing whatever I top my pizza with.  I just purchased a can and stuck my spoon in after opening...wow....I was once again transported back over half a decade.  Nothing like it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGulden's, Spicy Brown Mustard, 12oz Bottle (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nGulden's mustard has been in my refrigerator for years now, the brand of mustard, not the same bottle.  I will say that I like a variety of mustards on hand for different foods such as a horseradish mustard, a hot mustard, a smoked mustard, a dill mustard and plain old yellow mustard.  But Gulden's is the mustard I reach for for the main usage.\n\nIt goes with just about any sandwich, works well in home made salad dressings and blends up well in marinades.  It is delicious served with cold roast beef or roast pork on the side and the blend of spices compliments just about any application you would want to use it for.  You know it's really good when there are less that six ingredients listed on the label.  No long list of unpronounceable additives or enhancers.  No fat making be a very healthy flavor boost when watching calories.  A tried and true product that's been around for decades.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['flavor', 'use', 'used', 'always', 'much', 'like', 'tea', 'make', 'years', 'one']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nJUST LIKE SUGAR Just Like Sugar, 5.82 Ounce\nReview:\nI purchased a bag of this product which cost about $20 with shipping. The bag isn't quite as big as buying a bag of regular sugar,so in comparison, it's really expensive. That wouldn't bother me if I had been more pleased with it, but it really IS NOT just like sugar.. It's not as sweet at all and just doesn't work that great for baking, which is what I purchased it for. My husband is diabetic and really misses cookies, and we don't want to use any of the artificail sweetners on the market because of all the health hazards connected to them. But Just Like Sugar is not the answer. I made one batch of oatmeal cookies, one pan of brownies and one batch of no bake cookies with this one bag of product, so it cost almost $7 per batch for the sweetner!!! The oatmeal cookies were just so so.. not bad, but not great.. definatly not as sweet as they should have been and they had a different kind of texture.. I'm not quite sure how to describe it..Kind of grainy... The brownies, horrible!! A recipe that normally makes delicious brownies turned out flat and not very tasty. We ate one brownie each and threw the rest out. The no bake cookies were ok, probably the best out of the three recipes, but still not that great... My package of Just Like Sugar also included a small sample of the Just Like Brown Sugar.. I put it on my oatmeal but could barely tell there was any sugar on it..\nAll in all, I guess if you have no alternative it's better than nothing, but I won't ever purchase it again.. I'll stick to Stevia, which is also a natural product and is super duper sweet! I thought the Just Like Sugar would be more convenient because the makers of it claim you use the very same amount in recipes as real sugar, and with Stevia, there's a lot of conversion.. But the claims just aren't true... You'd need to use quite a bit more of the Just Like Sugar in order to have the same sweetness as sugar. Very dissapointing..

These crackers are made by the same company with different name. The Yehuda crackers are made larger, crispier and tastier than the (AGF) although they are from same manufacturer. Seems that Yehuda's are thicker so there are less broken up pieces. I will not purchase the Absolute gluten free crackers b/c its not as superior as the Yehuda's. I also want to mention that although the Yehuda's seems more expensive and they are but the box is bigger, crackers are larger so if you campare them with (AGF) crackers, these are about the same price in my opinion b/c they taste better and less damaged pieces.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPamela's Products Gluten Free Whenever Bars, Cranberry Almond, 5 Count Box, 7.05-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nYes, I love these bars.

I love the taste and texture of the Original stove made cereal. It is becoming harder to find . I was really glad to find it here.\n\nI believe that the reason it is so hard to find now is due to the Instant pouches becoming so popular. Personally I find that those come out really lumpy.  So for me stove top vs instant, stove wins hands down. I would  highly recommend this product to others.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGreen Mountain Coffee Decaf Dark Magic, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nThis is one of my favorite k cups. I only drink decaf coffee, sometimes though I want a coffee that has a stronger richer taste. When I do  dark magic is the coffee I gravitate to.  I have some family members who now drink dark magic (caffeinated) after trying the decaf. They tell me the taste is pretty much the same  all your missing is the \"Buzz\". At first when I got dark magic decaf in a sampler I avoided it thinking it would be one of those bitter varieties. It's not it actually  has a smooth taste. I have drank it with and without creamer and have even used flavoring syrups with it. So it works well with a variety of options.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n McCormick Black Ground Table Pepper, 18-Ounce \nReview:\nMy grandmother really likes the taste  of pepper and swears that the McCormick brand of black pepper. She puts it on nearly every savory dish we cook in abundance. I am more of a subtle seasoning user myself, I too however favor this brand because of it's fresh taste and aroma. I would definitely recommend this brand having tried several store brands and not liking the taste whatsoever, because they tasted flat or like the tin can.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAlpine Spiced Cider Apple Flavor Drink Mix, 10-Count, 7.4-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI love Alpine Spiced Apple Cider Origal Drink Mix. It is becoming increasingly harder to find in my area . So I was very glad to find that I could subscribe and save a whole case of this Item.\n\nIt reminds me so much of the big pots of  Hot Apple cider that would be passed out to us after we had gone pumpkin picking at one of the local farms.\n\nI would highly recommended this product to others.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBarista Prima Decaf Italian Roast K-Cup Coffee 72 count\nReview:\nOne of the things I really miss about caffeinated coffee is the smell and taste of fresh perculated coffee. This is what this coffee reminded me of when I brewed my first k cup. It tasted the same way when I tasted it.  If you want a strong flavor but avoiding caffeine I don't believe this coffee will disappoint you.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDoritos Tortilla Chips, Cool Ranch, 11 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nNacho flavored Doritos happen to be one of my grandmother's little weaknesses. However we are trying to cut back on our eating of snacks  with such a high sodium content.  These 11oz bag gives her the cheesy flavor she loves while limiting how much she eats. As she tries to make them last longer. She loves the taste and crunch of these chips and would recommend this product to others.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['would', 'like', 'taste', 'recommend', 'product', 'flavor', 'good', 'really', 'one', 'highly']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nRaw Rev Organic Superfood Bar, Chocolate Coconut Bliss, 1.8 Ounce Bar (Pack of 12) 6g Protein, 4g Fiber, Vegan, Raw, Organic, Plant-Based, Gluten-Free, Fruit, Nut, Seed Bars\nReview:\nI am shocked to hear from others (via reading these reviews) the feedback re the bars. I know people have diffetent tastes but they are so flavorful..not at flavorless by any means. Texture is lovely too, like read food, someone said cardboard? that's just weird.  For me they taste of raspberries and chocolates, as I read the ingredients, exactly what they ate made of. No more..no less.  I love the simplicity of the raw food diet, which I think is helpful, too, if you have any digestion issues, to not have too many ingredients, or by products, or chemicals, just whole foods.  They are just decadent, too. The best raw food bar in taste and texture, for me anyway, most especially for the money. The best ever bar I've had, really. I hate to talk them up too much and have you be disappointed, I mean they are a food bar, not nirvana, lol.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I like this salt because it is a status symbol. If I put this salt on the table everyone will know I have excellent taste and refinement. In any case, if Maldon is good enough for the Queen it is good for sure! Not only because she is a Queen but because grandmothers just seem to know what is good to have in the kitchen. I take a pinch of Maldon salt flakes, crush and sprinkle on foods. Makes the food quite tasty. The texture of Maldon salt flakes is neither too hard nor too soft. Seems just right.

Miyasaka miso is well worth a try. Healthy and delicious. I wish this soup had come to my attention earlier. Easy to make. Put cube in cup and add hot water. I like to add mushrooms. If a poll were taken  it's likely at least 9 out of 10 samurai would recommend Miyasaka Instant Vegetarian Soup.  I could say why but the FDA has rules about making certain claims regarding foods. Better if you buy the miso and try for yourself.  I consider this miso an ethnic food that anyone could relish. Convenient to take along or enjoy at home. Individual pouches.  I hope they produce a TV infomercial for this product so I can watch while enjoying a bowl of Miyasaka miso. You might want to add a miso soup spoon to the shopping cart when ordering.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nViana Veggie Gyros, 7.05 Ounce\nReview:\nHi!

It is already to heat and eat. Convenient! I would buy again.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKa-Me Noodle Box, Pad Thai, 11.6 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis teriyaki is simple to prepare. Just heat and eat. Probably a good idea to add some veggies or tofu. For the price this teriyaki is a good buy. I take off one star because this is not top of the line teriyaki in my opinion.  Ka-Me Teriyaki is a tasty side item to enjoy with other Asian foods or as a quick snack. I'd compare this to Annie Chun's teriyaki noodle bowl.  Noodles and sauce packet. If you want a basic teriyaki this could be a good choice.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKoyo Noodles-udon, 8-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nHi! This ramen looks like everyday ramen. The difference between Koyo and cheap ramen noodles is the quality. You can use all the flavor packet without dumping chemicals onto your noodles. The flavoring packet is all natural. I seldom pay much attention to the word organic on labels. So many claims on food packs. This caught my attention. I've been looking for ramen that is a more healthy choice than the budget types. Price is a consideration. I found Koyo on sale at Amazon Warehouse Deals. I recommend Koyo for a way to enjoy ramen that is good for satisfying hunger and is healthy eating.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCJ Hetbahn Cooked White Rice, Gluten-Free, Vegan, Microwaveable, 7.4-oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nHi! Heat the rice in microwave for 2 minutes and it's ready to serve. Very easy food for anytime. I bought Kitchens of India curry products to mix with this rice. The combo makes a delicious meal item. I compare CJ Cooked White Rice to Annie Chun's sticky white rice. Different bowl design but same type rice. The plus is CJ rice usually costs less than Annie Chun's. The minus is the CJ rice bowl is neither for recycling nor is biodegradable. Inside the triangle where a recycle number would be is Korean script. Beneath the triangle is the word \"other\".  Annie Chun's bowls are biodegradable being made with corn starch.  There are so many ways to prepare rice. CJ Cooked White Rice could be a great choice. I recommend trying to decide for yourself.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nZhena's Gypsy Tea Extra Strength Slim Me Green Tea, Superfruit Mixed Berry, 30 Count, 1.5 Oz\nReview:\nI've just begun using this product. I'd need to drink for a longer time to be sure of how effective it is for losing weight. However, since there are no other reviews for this particular Zhena's tea I will submit comments.  The taste is good. I like it. The can was super tough to open. I had no luck with rubber grip things. I used a metal opener (vise grip style) and got lucky after several tries. I've been drinking this tea iced. I actually visited a drug store to check another diet product. Zhena's tea was on sale and seemed a more economical choice that what I'd come in to buy. Hence, I bought Zhena's. I recommend trying this tea.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBell Plantation PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter, 1 lb Jar (2-pack)\nReview:\nHi! I bought this from Warehouse Deals.

This is an excellent product if you like peanut butter but worry about fats and oils. Most are removed. I recommend the product. It has multiple uses. Can mix with honey, use as a topping and of course make peanut butter cookies. That last one is my favorite. PB cookies are my weakness.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHoosier Hill Farm Nutritional Yeast Flakes, 1 Pound\nReview:\nHi! First time I buy this product. I am very pleased with the taste and texture.

Not as strong Dunkin' as I would expect (or want) from a DARK ROAST.  I like my coffee to provide a rich, robust, deep flavor - just short of French or Italian or Espresso roasts - Starbuck's Morning Joe, for example.  This ain't it.  Not dreadful but nothing to displace the current house favorites.\n\nHouse Blend is pretty lame (or tame if you're being charitable).  Weaker than Donut Shop - if Donut Shop is a 4 on a 5-point scale, Dark Roast would be a 3 and House Blend a 2.  Just not much by way of rich coffee flavor or aroma.\n\nFinal word: these K-cups are being shelved and will bring them out to offer to my in-laws when they invade the house (they all drink coffee with milk and sugar so what difference does the coffee make - not that they have ever actually finished a cup - they just make 'em and then leave them all over the house for me to find after they leave...sometimes LONG after they leave since they \"hide\" them all over).

Tetley's British Blend comes close, but as the reviews suggest, Tips is tops.  Quite likely that it WAS the tea I was drinking.  Brewed according to the rules - warmed pot taken to the boiling water and steeped for 5 minutes - it is rich and flavorful (flavourful?) without being bitter or harsh.

However, i thought i would share my story as a survivor of the Mad Dog bite. Here is my account as posted on a blog site i use.\n\nSo, a new store opened in the Gateway shopping district in downtown Salt Lake City recently called Hot Sauce & Things (at least, i think that's what it was called...my memory is a little shaky after....). Shelly and i wandered in there last Sunday out of curiosity and boredom. There were only three other people in the store....the employee, a nice Korean girl (comes into play later) and a young couple who had name tags from another store in the Gateway. Anyway, they were sitting at the bar which also functions as a checkout stand trying hot sauces. After a minute of browsing, i here the guy exclaim, \"Ooh, that's HOT!\". The employee was like \"Yeah, I'm Korean, and i cant even eat more than a toothpick's (dipped in) worth. Ahhh....now my interest and curiosity were piqued.\nThe couple left without buying anything. Shelly and i had already grabbed a few promising sauces to try out at home. I walked up and asked the girl if we could try the last one the dude before us had tried. She said it was the hottest one sold. However, before you can try it, you have to build up to it. Thus began my journey through five continents and twenty four different hot sauces, ranging from the jalapeno based sauces, through the habanero based ones, and past the ghost pepper based sauces, to be greeted by my twenty fifth and final opponent, the Mad Dog 357 (complete with bullet holes and a whole list of caveats printed on the bottle. Let me just say, prior to that one, my mouth was already on fire and my insides were feeling a bit shaky. Afterwards.....well, lets just say i abhor even the thought of consuming milk, but quickly drank deeply of the chocolate milk they also sold there. I felt buzzed out and disoriented, like i had just left a bar in the new light of the morning sun after having sat in the dark and dank establishment all night. My heart was racing and my body felt like a balsa wood building try to stand against hurricane winds.\nNeedless to say, i bought a bottle, took it to work, and made every single person i work with try it (in many cases i tried it again with them). Word got out and for the next three days (including today), doctors, nurses and administrators all came down to try this now legendary hot sauce (i work in a hospital). Best dollars i ever spent!\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

These seeds are as good, if not outright better, than any we have bought in smaller quantities, and the price is fantastic. We love it, and we're saving $$$.

Plus, they are organic and come in a nice plastic container. I drink chai in the morning and use these on a regular basis, along with the other chai spices, of course. Nothing quite like fresh spices. Once you have used fresh spices like these cardamom pods, you'll never go back to the dried and tasteless little jars you find in the spice section of your local grocery store. I love these cardamom pods.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCrown Prince Flat Anchovies in Olive Oil, 2-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI've been buying anchovies from Papa Murphy's Pizza as I buy pizzas. But as a result, I've been paying quite a bit more for them than you will pay for these Crown Prince anchovies. I have always been a fan of the Crown Prince smoked oysters, but never tried the anchovies. What the hey, I bought a dozen, at $1.45 a can when I bought them. Over a dollar savings from Papa Murphy's, and even more over the cost in the grocery store. And guess what! They are excellent, just as good as any other brand, and maybe even better (a little hard to tell one salty fish from another, really). I highly recommend these anchovies, they are the perfect topping for your own pizzas.

It makes a WORLD of difference to have fresh, rather than old dried out pods, and this company provided some of the freshest I have had. I heartily recommend these pods. Btw, only order what you will be using in a month, so that you always have fresh pods on hand. That's what I do.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMcCormick Dark Chili Powder, 20 oz\nReview:\nWhen we ran out of chili powder, and we use a lot of it, I basically bought this based on the size and price. But am I glad I did! My former chili powder was lighter, with a weak aroma, and I had to use a lot of it to get any kick to my chili. This chili powder, however, is rich, dark, and has a wonderfully pungent aroma and adds a great flavor to chilis and other mexican dishes without having to use several tablespoons of the product. Thumbs up to McCormick for a great chili powder!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLily's Dark Chocolate Bar with Coconut Stevia, 3 Ounce\nReview:\n1. I'm a chocolate lover. 2. I'm mildly allergic to milk. 3. I'm on a low carb diet. 4. I hate artificial colors, flavors, and sweeteners. So what should I do? Voila! Lily's came out with an entire line of chocolate bars that have just a little milk fat (not enough to trigger my allergies), no sugar, and no artificial sweeteners. They have the ONLY bars sweetened with Stevia, and what is most amazing is that they are wonderfully delicious! I always hated that nasty aftertaste of any chocolate I ate, but the only aftertaste with this product is a wonderful chocolatey coconutty flavor that is simply divine. Fact is, I never understood my wife's love of chocolate; I hated the stuff. But that was because of the milk and sweeteners. Since we discovered Lily's, I find I am completely, irrevocably, in love with their chocolate bars. I can't say enough good about them. No worries about sugar impact. Very few calories. Delightful taste. Perfect for low carb diets, and for my mind, any diet of any type, because they're better than all other bars. Just look at the ingredients! This is as good as it gets.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCrown Prince Premium Flat Anchovies in Olive Oil, 5-2oz.

I have also taken carbonated water and added a few drops to make a creme soda to good effect, but the frapp is my favorite. The price is excellent and the product absolutely fantastic. No bad aftertaste, just a nice sweet drink that is reminiscent of creme sodas from my childhood.

However, the steel cut oats I received cannot be prepared in any reasonable amount of time as I prepare to leave for work at 6:40 a.m.  I thought I could microwave it for a few minutes like I do with other old fashioned oats but I was sadly mistaken.  After about 15 minutes in the microwave (in stages) the product was still too chewy to stomach--and basically tasteless.  To be fair, the cooking instructions did not even mention microwaving.  It said to cook on the stovetop for five minutes at boiling and then cook at simmer for an additional 30 minutes.  All to prepare 1/4 cup of dried oats. I did not recall reading these directions when I ordered six boxes of these.  I might try to use some in bread, but otherwise I seem to have quite a lot of expensive, organic bird feed.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nIndus Organic Turkish Sultana Raisins, 2 Lb Bag, Sulfite Free, No Added Sugar, Freshly Packed, Premium Grade\nReview:\nThese are awfully dry and had an odd taste.

I now limit my intake to one a day and am good.\n\nThe taste is excellent to me. What attracted me to this product was that the main ingredient is listed as \"Chicory Root Extract\". Chicory root appears to have some unverified health benefits. I sometimes enjoy a little tea made from roasted chicory root and it just makes me feel better.\n\nEither way, If you are hungry and need a snack eat one of these, two or more in a day, be sure a potty is nearby.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPeople's Choice Beef Jerky - Classic - Original - High Protein Meat Snack - 3 Ounce Bag\nReview:\nI like their 'Old Fashioned - Original - Peppered - Sugar-Free' the best. This 'Classic' is priced slightly lower and beats the heck out of any national brand of jerky that I have tried. I would recommend this to anyone who likes jerky. It is chewy as you would expect natural jerky to be. I use a set of kitchen shears to cut this up into bite sized bits for snacking. Yum!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPOPCORNERS Sea Salt Popped Corn Snacks, Gluten Free, Non-GMO, Single-Serve 1oz bags (Pack of 40)\nReview:\nThis review is on the 'Sea Salt' flavor. For a serving size of a 1.1 ounce bag, the facts are: 3.5g fat, 0g trans fat, 0g saturated fat, 190mg sodium, 24g carbohydrate, 6% DV of iron. The ingredients: Yellow Corn, Sunflower Oil, Sea Salt.\n\nThe date code on the bags I received was for 10 months onto the future, I have no worry about being able to finish them by that time.\n\nThey are popped corn that has somehow been pressed into the shape of a fried corn chip. They are a little crisp mixed with the texture of popped corn, meaning they are not dry and as brittle as a corn chip. Medora did some kind of magic on the pressed chips to make them taste a bit like real corn chips. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised with the snack-ability, good job with that.\n\nI ate two bags of these and then placed an order for another 40 pack, of a different flavor. That is my endorsement.\n\nEnjoy.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeople's Choice Beef Jerky - Old Fashioned - Original - Sugar-Free, Carb-Free, Keto-Friendly - 1 Pound, 1 Bag\nReview:\nWhat can I say? This stuff is way better than most brands of jerky. I've got some 16 oz Jack Links left over that I do not want any more. I just ordered another pack of 'People's Choice' today. Natural, dried just right, not too chewy. A bit more expensive per ounce but worth every penny.\nJust for grins, I set the unopened pack on a postal scale, 17 1/2 ounces, pretty fair for a 16 ounce bag. The 'Sell By' date is 13 months into the future. No worry there, it will be long gone by the sell by date.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSwanson Chicken Cooking Stock, 26 Ounce Cartons (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nFirst off, if you are not used to low sodium items, this will taste a bit bland.

These have a lot of sodium, but I will take that any day over the increased cholesterol that hi fat chips can cause. I still work and still get hungry at work. Pretzels are one of the 'less harmful' snacks that I have found that can satisfy hunger. The 'use by' dates were a little different for all four types, ranging from 4-6 months into the future. I guess that is OK for a dried snack item. Good quality and fast delivery. I cannot get too excited about pretzels, so 5 stars. Now if they could only make potato chip flavored pretzels? :)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCrunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers, Gluten Free, 20 oz.\nReview:\nMy interest in this product started with my Doctor recommending that I eat a diet with more whole grains (and less red meat). These Mufti-Grain crackers are absolutely satisfying and tasty. They are not diet food. More like survival food. They do have 140 calories, 5g fat, 2g fiber and 3g protein per 30g (about 1 ounce) serving.\n\nThey have a sesame and soy flavor, combined with a delightful potato chip type crunch.\n\nMy only complaint is that they are sort of addictive, I just ordered my third box. Yummy.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nJack Link's X-Stick, Original, 0.5-Ounce X-Sticks (Pack of 50)\nReview:\nThese are along the line of Slim Jims but have a milder, less spicy, taste. The X-Sticks also have a much better texture than Slim Jims, these things actually look like they are made of real meat, NOT the 'mystery meat - goat hair/cardboard' texture of the modern Slim Jim.\n\nThe X-Stick is 'not exactly' a health food snack. They have a fair amount of fat, a little over 5 grams (each stick, in this package, is 14 grams total mass). Sodium content is about 224 mg and, about 3.2 grams of protein and only 64 calories (about 47 calories from fat) per stick.\n\nWhat the X-Stick is, is a very satisfying snack. I sometimes have to miss a meal, due to my work. One or two of these take the hunger away and puts some energy back into me. I do try to limit my fat intake but do not feel guilty about snacking on these once in a while.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nKen\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['good', 'coffee', 'enjoy', 'product', 'like', 'fat', 'little', 'flavor', 'taste', 'ounce']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nVogue Cuisine Onion Soup &amp; Seasoning Base 12oz - Low Sodium, Gluten Free, All Natural Ingredients\nReview:\nI decided to buy the seasoning base because of other people reviews.

Ginger is my go-to flavor.\n The flavor is integrated into the gum (rather than just in a coating) so its not overpowering and also lasts quite a long time.\n It seems more expensive, but with about 20 pieces per box (one piece at a time is sufficient) its actually not bad. A serving of Glee is 2 pieces, so a box of Glee gum contains 8 servings.\n The packaging design is beautiful and functional. It makes me a little happy whenever I use it.\n\nGlee Gum (3/5 gold stars):\n Glee Gum is tasty when you first chew it, but the flavor disappears quickly.\n The texture of Glee is also a bit dense and rigid for my liking  especially after a minute when the sugar is gone.\n Overall, Glee is economical and fine for people who don't want to chew for very long.\n The flavors are all quite good - my favorites are tangerine and mixed berry.\n\nId much rather chew either of these gums than go back to a major brand like Trident, etc. This is partly because I prefer Glee and Simply Gum and partly because they are more sustainable. Most leading brands of gum list a gum base on their ingredients. This gum base can include polyethylene (plastic), polyvinyl acetate (wood glue), paraffin wax, fats (hydrogenated vegetable oil) and talc.

I think that both of them are far superior to the big commercial brands of gum and both deserve 5/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. Here is some more info on these two brands:\n\n Harvesting natural gum from trees can help protect rainforests and support a sustainable practice that has gone on for thousands of years.\n Natural gum also has a lower carbon footprint than petroleum-derived ingredients that are used to make the gum base of commercial gum.\n Natural gums (Glee and Simply gum) are also biodegradable  reducing biological hazards (and ugly pavements).\n In Simply Gum, most of the ingredients (sugar, glycerin, rice flour) are organically grown.\n In Glee Gum, the sugar is not organic but it is Fairtrade certified.\n Both Glee and Simply Gum are packaged in recyclable cardboard boxes  no plastic.\n Both companies and woman-owned and based in the US.\n Glee Gum works with people with disabilities and supports Trees for the Future and scholarships at the Maya University in Mexico.\nMore info on sustainable chewing gum is available on my site  greenstarsproject.

I thought the chewy Chocolate Almond and Sea Salt with Chia bars were a little better than these  tastier and less dry. These Mocha bars are way too dry for my taste, even when I eat them with a drink. In person, they don't look nearly as tasty or as almond-rich as the bar pictured on the box, and then they also taste worse than they look. The flavor doesnt translate as mocha, and theres very little chocolate flavor either.\n\nI think people will be drawn to them for nutritional content, and I think its pretty well balanced when you look at overall content. It has a carbs to protein ratio of 3.5 to 1, which is close to whats considered optimal; low in fat, very high in fiber and moderate in sodium. So the overall balance (3.5 g fat, 4 g fiber, 6 g sugar, and 6 g protein) is pretty good from a purely accounting point of view. I don't love that the protein comes in the form of soy protein isolate however (i.e. the leftovers after oil has been extracted from soybeans with hexane) but thats common to most non-organic bars that use soy protein.\n\nTheir newer bars are organic and made with several Fair Trade certified ingredients (including cacao) but unfortunately they fall apart when you unwrap them. These chewy bars hold together better but are not made with Fair Trade certified cacao and thats disappointing. They need a combination of good ingredients and well-made bars. Kashi is also a company of contradictions. For example, they are proud of their new non-GMO products (this is not one of them) and yet in 2012 their parent company, Kellogg, donated $790,000 to the NO on Prop. 37 campaign (labeling of GMO foods). They were also I the news in 2012 for misleading labeling of products as natural (and using GMO ingredients)  the Kashi's general manager responded by stating, The FDA has chosen not to regulate the term 'natural. Overall I feel that they are a mix of good intentions and some bad practices that have seeped in as the company grew (and was acquired by the Kellogg Company). The ingredients are not too bad: for example theres expeller-pressed canola/safflower oil instead of palm oil, which is nice; but I feel that there are too many  it tastes like a highly processed product. Since it contains wheat, nuts, soy and milk, that excludes a lot of people these days!\n\nI feel that overall, for social and environmental impact, Kashi is a little above average, and even Kellogg (the parent company) is setting decent goals these days on things like energy use, waste, ingredient sourcing, etc., even working with the WWF to evaluate impact for their products. These particular bars however, not having organic (except for the cane syrup) or Fair Trade certified ingredients, deserve a middle-of-the-road 3/5 green stars for social and environmental impact and also 3/5 gold stars for overall quality.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nAnnie's Gluten Free  Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar Macaroni &amp; Cheese, 12 Boxes, 6oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nAnnies gluten-free elbows are made from rice pasta, and the vegan sauce is seasoned pumpkin and sweet potato. The pasta has good texture  rice makes good gluten-free pasta. The sauce is tasty, as long as you don't expect it to taste like cheese  it tastes like the ingredients: pumpkin and sweet potato! If you want a vegan mac and cheese then I suggest Earth Balances cheddar variety: its not gluten free, its high in sodium, but it tastes like the real thing! Annies product is unique, and props to them for developing a healthy vegan mac and cheese (high in vitamin A, decent fiber content, low sugar and fat). So, Id say if you're eating this often then go for Annies; if its an occasional teat then try Earth Balance.\n\nOverall, Id give Annies 3/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. However, some of their products are more sustainable and animal-friendly than others  this mac and cheese is vegan and made from organic ingredients and deserves 4/5 green stars.  Why not 5/5? Well, Annies is now owned by General Mills, who is considered one of the least sustainable of the Big 10 food conglomerates: check out their rating on Oxfams Behind the Brand scorecard. I like Annies but I don't love that they are now part of General Mills. You can see a concerning trend with some of Annies new products, like yogurt tubes, which are taking a step backwards in terms of sustainable packaging. Annies is fairly transparent about ingredients and company operations. They offset some of their carbon footprint through Native Energy and by supporting the Oka Forestry project. They contributed around $0.4 million to charitable causes such as school gardens, versus an annual gross profit of around $70 million  a moderate amount. They use 3550% post-consumer recycled content for paper and glass packaging, but recently improved on their packaging case for mac and cheese by replacing the top half of the case with shrink-wrap plastic! Id rather they stick with cardboard and use 100% post-consumer sources  after all, pasta is one of the products that doesnt require plastic packaging  why needlessly introduce plastic?\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nOrganic Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups by Justin's, Rainforest Alliance Certified Cocoa, Gluten-free, Responsibly Sourced, 12 Packs of 2-Cups each\nReview:\nI prefer to eat straight chocolate, but every now and then I think everyone craves a more guilty pleasure (whether something like a Snickers bar or Reeses cups) and I think Justins peanut butter cups fills this gap in a tastier, healthier, and more sustainable way. When you first try them they may seem different to what you're used to (sweeter than dark chocolate, not as sweet as the options mentioned above) but theres a good chance that theyll grow on you and youll eventually be craving more. Im not even that nuts (ho ho) about peanut butter, but Justins cups have converted metheres a good balance between chocolate and peanut butter. Im not going to discuss quality issues related to the supplier; Id suggest buying a pack locally if you want to try them out, and after that be cautious about who you buy them from (check out the other reviews). The ingredients are organic and Rainforest Alliance certified. Justins mention in their press releases and website product info that their chocolate is also fair trade, but theres no fair trade certification stamp on the product itself. One thing that irks me about Justins is that they sell a lot of single-serve nut butters in wasteful packaging.\n\nIf you eat two of Justins cups thats 8% of your salt daily value (dv) and 14 grams of sugar. That compares to 5% dv salt and 28 grams of sugar in a regular Snickers bar, and 6% dv salt / 31 grams sugar in a 2-pack of Reeses peanut butter cups. So, Justins have half the sugar, but actually higher in salt than the competition. I don't think Justins cups would lose anything if they reduced the salt content  they definitely taste a tad salty to me. All things considered, Im not going to eat any more Snickers or Reeses if I can help itthe impact on society and the planet is too great (see below).\n\nThere can be a huge difference in impact between buying chocolate that is considered fair trade and that which is not. On one hand you can support a sustainable business that in addition to giving workers a fair wage also helps the community in which the cacao is grown; on the other hand (think large multinational chocolate makers) the cheaper chocolate may come at the price of a very poor standard of life for workers, communities that don't benefit, and even child slavery. Child slavery is predominantly an issue in West Africa, where children can be sold by relatives or abducted from neighboring countries, and are forced to work long days under difficult conditions, harvesting cacao pods and missing an education in the process. Mars, Nestle, and (eventually) Hershey have issued statements that their cacao will be child-slavery-free by 2020so until then you know theres a tragic human cost behind their chocolate. Reeses is owned by Hershey while Snickers are made by Mars.\n\nOrganic certification is very significant when it comes to chocolate more pesticide is used to grow conventional cacao than almost any other crop, so organic certification is really important. For example, lindane (a neurotoxic organochlorine pesticide that bioaccumulates through the food chain) is commonly used on Cacao and is considered moderately hazardous, compromising the nervous and immune systems as well as posing a cancer risk. And yes, it has been detected in many conventional chocolate bars. It has been banned for agricultural use in the E.U. and U.S. now (which means its still in use for now in cacao-producing countries but being phased out, hopefully not replaced by some equally dubious compound in intensive farms; DDT preceded lindane and is still used on a few cacao farms). Besides the risk to the consumer, conventional (non-organic, non-shade-grown) cacao farming can be very bad news for tropical rainforests and the wildlife within.\n\nOverall, Id give it 4/5 gold stars for quality of the product and 4/5 green stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it. The newer Theo PB cups are a little better on both fronts, in my opinion.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n SNICKERS Minis Size Chocolate Candy Bars 4.4-Ounce Bag (Pack of 12) \nReview:\nI probably don't need to say too much about how they taste  youve probably tried them ;) But, in a nutshell (ho ho), Snickers are still synonymous with satisfying and are one of the best guilty-pleasure options for quickly replenishing energy. For me, they are one of the few candy bars (along with Twix which is also made by Mars) where the U.S. and European versions are both good. Compared to the other best-selling mainstream candy bars, I think Snickers has maintained quality over time, while others like Kit Kat and Reeses products have deviated too far from being actual food (and there are better PB cups out there now).\n\nSnickers loses a gold star because they do contain trans fats (from the partially hydrogenated oil). The label says 0% trans fat because they are allowed by the FDA to label it as such if its less than 0.5%. Other sources will show the trans fat content as 0.1%-0.2%. The trans fat is to me the biggest health risk in a Snickers; you know its bad when President Obama specifically calls for chocolate makers to phase it out within three years.\n\nBesides the 4/5 gold stars for quality, I think Snickers deserves 3/5 green stars for social and environmental impact (perhaps 2.5 stars for the mini version due to the extra packaging). Mars is the worlds second largest chocolate maker but is actually a leader (among these big companies) in sustainability. So, although they not are not up to the standard of some of the smaller organic fair trade chocolate makers, they are better than most of the other companies represented in places like 7-11 stores or gas stations. Read on if you want to hear more about sustainability\n\nHeres how Mars has performed on some of the sustainability goals that they set 2015 (relative to 2007 levels):\nGoal: Zero waste send to landfill. Progress is pretty good: as of 2013 they have reduced waste sent to landfill by 66%.\nGoal: 25% reduction in energy use by 2015 and carbon-neutral by 2040. Progress is slow: they have reduced fossil fuel use just 6.5% as of 2014.\nGoal: 25% reduction in water use. Progress isn't bad: as of 2014 they have reduced water use by 15%.\n\nOn other goals are on track, such as introducing recycled content in packaging (20% as of 2013), packaging recyclability (84%), palm oil accountability (84%), and coffee certification (100%). 30% of their cocao is certified, which is better than most of the very big chocolate makers, and some products such as Maltesers are made with 100% Fair Trade cacao. But Mars is still lagging behind the smaller, newer chocolate makers that use 100% Fair Trade cacao (and have a better record on energy use, packaging materials, etc.). Also, Snickers (and most Mars products) contain no organic ingredients, a pretty big drawback since a lot of nasty pesticides are used on cacao plantations.\n\nSo, I think Snickers is among best choices among the conventional, ultra-popular candy bars both in terms of quality and social responsibility. But if you want chocolate-peanut snacks that are better for society and the planet, I recommend Theos peanut butter cups (or Justins). Theos in particular are so much tastier than Snickers that they are worth the extra cost to me, and they're healthier too.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNature's Path Organic Cereal, Heritage O's, 32 Ounce Bag (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI bought these rice puffs to make some homemade fruit and nut bars - combined with nuts, seeds, dried fruit and some honey or brown rice syrup the rice puffs worked out really well. After adding the boiling brown rice syrup (or warmed up raw honey) I was concerned that the delicate puffs might disintegrate but they held together and didn't turn soggy. I also tried them with cold milk as a cereal and I thought they were OK - Id prefer if they were a bit crispier and next time Im going to try adding a little date syrup to sweeten them. I want to try their other puffed grains, like millet, especially when making bars.\n\nGluten: Brown rice itself is gluten free but this product is processed in a facility that contains wheat, so its not certified gluten free. So be careful if you have celiac disease, but if you're just trying to reduce gluten I think its not a big deal  there would probably only be trace amounts of gluten carried over from the equipment.\n\nI think they deserve 4/5 gold stars for quality and 5/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. Natures Path is a good company and better than the competition  they are considered one of the best and greenest companies to work for. Arrowhead Mills (owned by Hain) are also good but their rice puffs are not organic. Then in last place is Quaker (not organic and Quaker are owned by PepsiCo). I really like that the Natures path bag is made from #2 plastic (HDPE), the same type used for many plastic bottles, which makes them much more widely recyclable than the normal #4 bags (LDPE). It also means, no cardboard required. They have reduced their CO2 emissions per pound of product quite a lot since 2008 and aim to be carbon neutral by 2020. They donate at least $2 million each year to food banks and environmental causes and their EnviroKids products support 1% For the Planet. I think one of their biggest contributions have been in reducing packaging waste, so don't forget to recycle your bag once youve finished it!\n\nArsenic: There was a bit of a scare about arsenic found in rice so I think its useful to discuss that. Bear in mind that some organic arsenic is always found in rice because it occurs naturally in the soil and water, while inorganic arsenic is considered more harmful and may be present in the soil as a result of past pesticide use (e.g. on tobacco) or activities like gold mining. So Im only going to discuss the more harmful inorganic arsenic here. Inorganic arsenic levels are generally higher in rice grown in the U.S. (especially in TX, AR, LA, MO, where tobacco was farmed in the past) than crops from India or Thailand (Californian rice is generally fairly low in arsenic). Consumer Reports have an article (Arsenic in your Food) where they found roughly 3 micrograms of inorganic arsenic per serving of Indian or Thai rice, and around 5 micrograms for U.S. rice, with 9.6 micrograms being the highest levels found in U.S. rice. Bear in mind, that Consumer Reports are basing their safe limit (5 micrograms inorganic arsenic) on the New Jersey limit for inorganic arsenic in drinking water (5 parts per billion, ppb, which means 5 micrograms per liter of water) instead of the overall FDA limit of 10 ppb. None of the rice products in their 2012 report exceeded 10 micrograms arsenic per serving, and most of the studies on arsenic toxicity look at populations that regularly drink water above 50 ppb (50 micrograms per liter). Typical arsenic levels in water are 1-5 ppb, so a serving or rice gives you the same amount of arsenic as drinking a liter of water, or perhaps two. Its estimated that consuming 20 ppb of arsenic per day (2 servings per day of the most contaminated rice found in the U.S.) will increase your risk of developing bladder or lung cancer during your lifetime by 0.7%.  So Im not too concerned with arsenic in rice compared to other risks from processed food. Pregnant mothers could limit consumption to a serving or rice per day to be cautious, and avoid feeding rice-based products to newborn babies too frequently.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTERRA Sweets &amp; Beets Chips, No Salt Added, 6 oz. (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese crinkled sweet potato chips are almost as good as Jackson's Honest Sweet Potato Chips  but Id choose Jacksons if buying some again. Although, if you really want crinkles (or want to avoid the coconut oil in Jackson's) then these may be your chip! The sweet potato flavor is there (but not very strong) and they are crunchy and salted to a good level without being high in sodium (4% RDA). A serving (28 chips) provides 5% of your RDA for vitamin A and 11% of your fiber. But I do wonder why these chips only 5% of your vitamin A RDA when Jackson's chips provide 90% - sweet potatoes are very high in vitamin A, so these chips should be too! Sweet potatoes are really good for you, with anti-inflammatory benefits, and also control of blood sugar. I like that they are made with expeller-pressed oil  conventional oil is heated during extraction and then of course heated again during cooking, generating a lot of free radicals.\n\nBesides the regular score, Im giving them 4/5 green stars for social and environmental impact (more on that below).\n\nSweet potatoes are generally a pretty sustainable crop (water, fertilizer, and pesticide needs; yield) depending on how they are grown  these are unfortunately not organic. Terra is made by Hain Celestial, who ranks pretty well for things like energy use, waste reduction, greenhouse gas emissions, etc. For example, 99% of the solid waste at Terra facilities is recycled. The bags themselves are the main downside of this product (like virtually all chips) although you can send them to Terracycle if you collect them as you go. Hain Havent published a Corporate Social Responsibility report since 2012 however - they deserve to lose a green star for lack of transparency if they don't publish an updated report soon.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPeeled Snacks Organic Peas Please, Garden Herb, 3.3 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nIve tried several varieties of pea snacks (including Calbees Snapea Crisps and Trader Joes Inner Peas) and Peas Please is my favorite brand so far. I think they are also the best Ive found so far in terms of social and environmental impact  hence the 5/5 green stars  more on that later. The veggie-herb flavor comes from a mix of dried veggies like red bell pepper, tomato, onion and garlic, and also herbs, dill and parsley. The dill is not too strong and the flavor is well-balanced, so they are ideal if you're looking for something a little more flavorful than regular salted pea snacks. The main ingredients are organically grown green peas and brown rice, providing good sources of protein (5g per ounce), fiber (16% RDA) and iron (15% RDA), while being low in fat because they are baked. Not surprisingly, I ate the entire 3.3 ounce bag in one go, so that ended up providing half of my daily fiber and iron requirement, and about a third of my protein (an adult only needs around 50 grams of protein per day  many of us eat too much protein). They are also gluten-free. So, overall, thumbs up for Peas Please!\n\nAs far as social and environmental impact I think they are in the top 20% of their category, whether you count them as a snack or a protein source, so they deserve 5/5 green stars. The main thing that can be improved is the packaging  I would prefer if it was a compostable bag (which is rare, alas). The ingredients are all organic and the company (Peeled Snacks) works with farmers to encourage other improvements towards sustainability such as on-site solar panels or a biogas facility for energy conservation. They are a certified B-Corporation, and you can see their scores and company highlights on the bcorporation website (for example a living wage is paid to all employees, >50% of employees are women, >30% of suppliers are in low-income communities, 1% of sales go to charity, and 100% of products are organic).\n\nIn a broader sense, peas are a good sustainable source of protein. They are classified as pulses (part of the legume family)  these plants fix their own nitrogen and therefore have much lower fertilizer needs. Nitrogen fertilizer is generally made from natural gas (or even coal) and accounts for around 40% of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture. Besides saving energy and CO2, peas can also enhance the soil by adding nitrogen and other nutrients, making them a good rotation crop. The UN declared 2016 the year of the pulse to draw attention to these foods as more sustainable protein sources.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTheo Pure Dark 85% Chocolate Bars, 3-ounce Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI think the strange thing about dark chocolate bars is that they can taste great on some days and lackluster on others. I think (like wine) a lot depends on what youve been eating before it and the temperature. With dark chocolate I think its important to let it melt in your mouth to get the experience - just chewing it up may not be very satisfying. With all that said, I think the Theo 85% bar may well be a 5-star experience for some people but for me it paled a little compared to the bars from Equal Exchange and Alter Eco that Id tried earlier in the week. For sure, its much tastier than a Hersheys bar or your average generic chocolate.\n\nI found that the chocolate melted well enough in my mouth (compared to other 85% bars; it certainly wouldnt be fair to compare it to milk chocolate) if its slightly above room temperature. Id strongly recommend letting it sit in a warm place for a short while before eating it  this improves the experience a lot.  In terms of flavor didn't get any fruitinesswhich isn't necessarily a bad thing if the chocolate flavor shines. I felt that the chocolate flavor was good, but wasn't that memorable and didn't leave me craving more. By the way, if you're looking for a good source of iron, this bar has relatively low iron content compared to many other dark chocolate bars.\n\nGiven the choice of other fair trade dark chocolate bars Id rather go with with Equal Exchange, Alter Eco, or Endangered Species. I do prefer Theo to Newmans Own, Green and Blacks, and Dagoba, however.\n\nOverall, Id give it 4/5 gold stars for quality of the product and 5/5 green stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it (more on that below).\n\nThere can be a huge difference in impact between buying chocolate that is fair trade certified and that which is not. On one hand you can support a sustainable business that in addition to giving workers a fair wage also helps the community in which the cacao is grown; on the other hand (think large multinational chocolate makers) the cheaper chocolate may come at the price of a very poor standard of life for workers, communities that don't benefit, and even child slavery.

Perfect.\n\nBack before coconut milk was sold in cans anywhere except Chinatown (I'm that old), there was a recipe going around (with no internet) for making your own.

Some straining was needed unless you didn't mind the tiny coconut bits.  Philippine coconut was the best.  This is what it tasted like.\n\nMy cat likes coconut milk as a treat.  Sometimes.  But this coconut milk, the Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk SIMPLE, she slurps up like a dog.  SHE LOVES IT.  When she hears me pull the can tab, her ears perk up.

It also tastes very nice on toast and other food. It has a light sesame taste. But it becomes rancid and goes bad fairly quickly, even when you keep it in the refrigerator. Because this is expensive, it is simply not worth it for me. There are issues with the bottle cap -- it does not stay on very well. It is not easy to pour the amount of oil you want from this bottle -- a lot of oil comes out and runs down the sides of the bottle.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTrader Joes Pumpkin Butter, 10 Ounce\nReview:\nThis is spicier and much sweeter than pumpkin pie -- maybe because it has 9g of sugars in it. This might not be the healthiest choice of Pumpkin Butter, but it is very tasty. I enjoyed it. The ingredients listed on the jar are pumpkin, sugar, honey, lemon juice concentrate, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKevala Organic Toasted Sesame Seeds 2Lbs\nReview:\nThese sesame seeds are fresh and very yummy! You can add them to salads and all types of food. If you mix them with a little bit of honey, they taste almost like candy. You can put some honey or your favorite spread on top of a sandwich, sprinkle sesame seeds on top--and then you have a crunchy sesame seed sandwich! These are also a lot cheaper than if you buy them at the grocery store.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSimply Organic Curry Powder Certified Organic, 3-Ounce Bottle\nReview:\nWhen you first open the bottle, the aroma smells so good! I think this is very fresh. It tastes delicious on many foods. I tried it on a tuna melt sandwich and an egg salad sandwich. It makes eggs tastes great! Then I went wild, and I began sprinkling it on everything I ate. That was a mistake, because I think I developed an allergy to it. It began to upset my stomach. My advice is -- use this in moderation. It is very strong.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Indus Organics Turmeric (Curcumin) Powder, 1 Lb Jar, Premium Grade, High Purity, Freshly Packed \nReview:\nFor over a year I added this to coffee or tea because I read it had a lot of health benefits. It is supposed to be a natural pain reliever. For some people, it helps relieve inflammation. If I try it again, I will probably get a different brand. This brand of turmeric is very gritty. I don't think it is fresh. After taking it for a year, it did not make my health better or worse. It did not relieve my back pain. But it stained my teeth. Turmeric will stain anything it touches. This brand tastes awful. Don't put it in a smoothie. Some people put turmeric on their face, as a facial. There is also a hair remover recipe that uses turmeric.\n\nI did not experience any side effects from taking this. But some people will experience side effects and allergic reactions from turmeric. It interferes with some medications. Because turmeric originates from other countries, the powder is sometimes mixed with dye and inedible or unsafe substances. Turmeric powder should be a gold yellow color. If it is more of an orange red color, then you know that something suspicious is in it.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nKevala Organic Raw Sesame Seeds 1Lb\nReview:\nRaw sesame seeds have a better nutritional value than toasted sesame seeds, so I wanted to try them. These seeds have a very bitter, unpleasant taste. They would be okay to cook with. But I like to sprinkle sesame seeds on top of food, and these seeds are not good for that. I really enjoyed this same brand's toasted sesame seeds. The difference in taste between raw and toasted sesame seeds is like night and day.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSunButter Organic Sunflower Seed Spread Creamy - 16 oz\nReview:\nThis contains only Roasted Organic Sunflower seed. No sugar. No salt. It contains 25% daily value of magnesium and 40% daily value of vitamin E. That is pretty healthy. I love sunflower seeds. But this does not taste like sunflower seeds. It tastes gritty, grainy, oily, burnt, and bitter.  It is bitter because it has no sugar. It tastes burnt because maybe they roasted it too much. A lack of sugar is healthy. But a nut butter that tastes bitter and burnt is not yummy, in my opinion. Maybe I could visualize a field of beautiful sunflowers as I eat this, and then it would taste better?\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nHoosier Hill Farm Pumpkin Seeds - Pepitas, 1 lb.\nReview:\nThese pumpkin seeds have hardly any taste--they were almost flavorless. They did not taste fresh, and they were not delicious. These seeds come from China (says so on the website). Another brand of pumpkin seeds that I tried afterwards tastes a hundred per cent better than these do. The pumpkin seeds that taste better came from Mexico. The country of origin seems to make a difference in the quality of pumpkin seeds.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nMcCormick Gourmet Collection, Toasted Sesame Seed, 1.62-Ounce (Packaging May Vary)\nReview:\nThese sesame seeds taste great! They make any food taste better. As a bonus, they contain a high amount of calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and other needed minerals and vitamins. The only negative is that this is a small bottle, and it is a little pricey. But I enjoyed them.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYS Organic Bee Farms CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY 100% CERTIFIED ORGANIC HONEY Raw, Unprocessed, Unpasteurized - Kosher 32oz(pack of 1)\nReview:\nThis is very sweet, and I bought it twice. But it tastes more like crystalized sugar than honey. This is very thick honey. You can't pour it. Sometimes it hardens, and then it is difficult to spread. I bought fresh honey from a beekeeper, and the beekeeper honey tasted so much better than this one. This honey does not have a strong taste at all. It is just sugary. I prefer a rich honey taste, and this honey does not have that. But this is super-sweet honey, so it is sure to please many people.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['taste', 'tastes', 'seeds', 'honey', 'pain', 'like', 'much', 'good', 'sesame', 'bottle']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nSPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Packets, 400 Count\nReview:\nI have been using Splenda for years, despite being aware of what 'potential' side effects it may cause.\nI haven't bought sugar in years and all I use is Splenda.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It is sweet, almost tastes like mapley-molasses, and has no bitter taste to it at all.\n\nNow, the container is a different matter. Yacon syrup is very thick, and some of it tends to stay in a sludgy, solid mass in the bottom. If the syrup was packaged in a jar, it would be much easier to mix up. After struggling with it for awhile, I finally poured as much of the syrup as possible out of the bottle, and then added some hot water to it, shook it up, poured it into a glass jar, and refrigerated it.\n\nI shall be able to use it this way, although it is a bit watered down. The taste of the syrup is excellent - IF you can get it out of the bottle!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Organic Fair Trade Certified Red Palm Oil, 15 Ounce (pack Of 1)\nReview:\nThis was my first experience with red palm oil, and I have to say - I like it! I make popcorn with coconut oil, and then had the red palm oil and butter melted together, which I poured over it. A touch of salt, and I had some really good popcorn!\n\nI tasted it right out of the jar, with a spoon, and it tasted smooth and pleasant. Last night, I made some buttermilk and teff pancakes, and cooked them in it. The oil smoked a lot, but I had it on a very high heat - simply because I was trying to get finished before my husband's burger was done.\nThey tasted great!\n\nI like how this is obtained, without destroying any natural habitats, and am pleased with the taste of it. I can hardly wait to use it to make some scrambled eggs, as I am sure the color will intensify the natural look of the finished product.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n2.65 LBS Organic LOW GLYCEMIC Thai Coconut Blossom Sugar Paste - Divine Organics - Mineral and Enzyme Rich Sweetener (2.65 LBS)\nReview:\nI purchased this from a different website, but it is the same thing.

The taste was refreshingly different from the sea salt we have been using, AND, this morning, my fingers were not bloated. That was amazing.\n\nOne try is not really enough to tell if a product is excellent, but the taste is, and the \"no-bloated-fingers-effect\" is, too!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBraga Organic Farms Pumpkin Seeds, Raw, 2 Pound\nReview:\nGood, fresh pumpkin seeds.

I put some in my blender with some refrigerated coffee and some Coffeemate. After blending it up, I cautiously tasted it. Having used so many different types of sugar substitutes over the years, I was expecting to be disappointed.\n\nI used stevia for years, from several different companies. After 16 years of use, the balls of my feet hurt so badly that it was painful to walk. I stopped using stevia, and they improved. Then, I experimented again with it - my feet were painful, again. So, I have been looking for a sweetener for my coffee that had no calories, and did not impair my health. When I saw \"Just Like Sugar\" here on Amazon, I thought I would give it a fair trial.\n\nTo my delight, I thought it tasted wonderful! No aftertaste, no sickening sweet taste, and very, very smooth. I know it has only been a day, but my first impression is that it is delightful. I will most definitely order it again, and really like the taste!\n\nUPDATE - ONE WEEK LATER: My original opinion stands. I really like \"Just Like Sugar\"! For me, there is no aftertaste, no bloating like I always got with Xylitol, no foot pain like I eventually got with Stevia, and no extreme thirst issues, as I got with Swerve, which is erythritol. No bloating, no diarrhea, and no strange feelings in my stomach after ingesting it.\n\nGlad someone makes this, and hope that my initial experience with it holds.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa, 26 Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nGood quinoa, but then, everything I have ever purchased from Bob's Red Mill has been excellent!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKashi 7 Whole Grain Pilaf, Our Original, 8.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nMy family has loved Kashi Pilaf, since 1989, when we discovered it.

I thought it was too cheap to be organic.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Natural Products 2693 Fenugreek seed powder, organic 16oz\nReview:\nI bought Frontier because of the bad review on the competitor brand.

I have only tried one other coconut oil, Aloha Nu, before this one.  Aloha Nu may have spoiled me with its freshness and strong smell and flavor of coconut.  I'll definitely be going right back to Aloha Nu even if it does have a plastic bottle.\n\nThe Amazon description says the Coconut Pacific is cold pressed, but it doesn't say that anywhere on the four 4 - ounce glass bottles.  It does say it is raw and virgin but it is way too mild with very little freshness or coconut in the smell or taste.  I have some serious doubts about whether this coconut oil is truly raw or may just be made from lower quality coconuts than the Aloha Nu, which I had little doubt about being raw and made with quality coconuts.  Some people go out of their way to find this mildness so Coconut Pacific may be to their liking but not mine.  It is always liquid and would probably make a fine tanning oil.  The four small jars are inconvenient and overpriced overall for a mere 16 ounces, but I'm keeping the cute little jars for when I want to give somebody some seasonings or something.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nManitoba Harvest Organic Hemp Oil, 8 Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nSince I've been on the hemp oil bandwagon I've tried five brands.\n\nManitoba Harvest, Just Hemp, and Swanson were very bland, so I give them three stars.\n\nNutiva was flavorful but has an off taste, so I give it four stars.\n\nCanada Hemp Foods is the best tasting, so I give it five stars.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nManitoba Harvest Hemp Hearts Raw Shelled Hemp Seeds, 2oz (Pack of 12); with 10g Protein &amp; Omegas per Serving, Non-GMO, Gluten Free\nReview:\nI can't tell the difference between Manitoba Harvest and Swanson.  It's bland, but very easy to eat.\n\nIt's definitely a superfood with a ton of magnesium and manganese, which are both very hard to find in food.\n\nIt is also very high in both Essential Fatty Acids.  Even though it is just the inner meat with no hull, it still has 1 gram of fiber per tablespoon, too.\n\n19 Nov 2017 update:\nThe Swanson I just got is a bit gritty, so I downgrade it to 3 stars.  I'll stick with the 5 star Manitoba.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYS Organic Bee Farms CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY 100% CERTIFIED ORGANIC HONEY Raw, Unprocessed, Unpasteurized - Kosher 32oz(pack of 1)\nReview:\nThis is good honey.  I bought this cheaper at my health grocery.  You can buy this honey at many health food stores, too.  I've tried 11 raw, most of which were unfiltered, honeys, and I don't have any real complaints about this one.  It is waxy, which is common, but it is very hard, making it fairly hard to dig it out with a spoon, even though it melts easily and completely in your mouth.  I suppose this is a fairly minor problem, but I wouldn't buy it again.  It is a very mild/bland honey, which some people may prefer.  That said, I only found one raw, unfiltered honey on Amazon that I liked a little better.\n\nThe Amish Mountain honey is a little more expensive, but it has a little more flavor and a nice honey like consistency.\n\nI also found a local honey at my health food store that is a dark desert mesquite honey with a normal honey like consistency and lots of flavor for a honey.  It is also cheap, but Happy Bear honey is probably only available in Arizona.  That's the only reason I didn't give this YS organic honey five stars.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nReally Raw Honey, Totally Unprocessed, 5-Pound\nReview:\nThis is a fairly good honey.  It is soft with a mostly pasty but also some honey like consistency.  I didn't notice any off flavor or smell.\n\nThe capping is quite awful, though.  You aren't doing yourself any favors by chewing and spitting out the wax layer on top to get the last drop of honey out of your jar.  It sticks to your teeth and is quite nasty.  None of the other raw, unfiltered honeys had this problem even though many did have a waxy consistency throughout.  Once you get through the top layer, though, it is a good honey without any other faults.\n\nI would rate it about the same as the Wee Bee, and below the YS organic and Amish Mountain.  The YS organic has a hard, waxy texture, which could be a usability problem for some people.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nLundberg Family Farms Organic Brown Sweet Rice, 25 Pounds (Packaging May Vary)\nReview:\nThis is the best and softest rice if you eat raw brown rice.  Soak it for two days first.  It is very fresh with no rancid smell to it.\n\nIf you like soft cooked rice, this sticky/sushi rice is very soft and sticky.  Soak it for at least one day first.  I wouldn't say it is any sweeter than other rice, though.  I prefer regular short grain rice, which is a little heavier with more flavor and much less slimy, mushy, and watery, but this rice is better when eaten cold the next day.  Basmati rice with its nutty or popcorn flavor is my favorite by far.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNova Maple Sugar - Pure Grade-A Maple Sugar (6 Ounces)\nReview:\nIt tastes fine, but it is moist and forms very hard clumps that are hard to break up.

Decent quality bee pollen is very hard to find.\n\nI like my local bee pollen the best (5 stars), though it isn't organic.  It has the nice gold/brown color and is soft with a rich texture and flavor.  It is $15 / pound.  Try your bulk foods natural foods grocer or bulk foods health food store.\n\nThe Greenbow organic bee pollen is very good (probably 5 stars) and is the only organic bee pollen I've tried.  I have no complaints at all except for the price, about double my local inorganic bee pollen.  If I lose my last source of local bee pollen I'll gladly switch to Greenbow.\n\nStakich - 1 star - has a bad off taste, is hard and hard to eat/chew, is green/yellow rather than yellow/orange/brown, and has an unpleasant taste and texture.\n\nFrontier - 1 star - nice yellow/orange color but otherwise similar to Stakich with thin flavor and texture.\nRating:\n1.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['flavor', 'raw', 'coconut', 'good', 'nuts', 'honey', 'quality', 'stars', 'like', 'hard']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nMassimo Gusto Extra Virgin Avocado Oil, 1 Liter Bottles (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nI am not sure I like it as much a Olive oil it does have a different taste but use it often\ngrilled veggies and everything else\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I think I finally found one that I'd stay with, until someone comes up with a better/tastier/easier product.\n\nThis is s small palm sized waffle, not hallow but semi soaked (moist).  It will crumble therefore don't take it out of th package (the package can catch the falling crumbs)\n\nTo open is easy, just tear the folded area with your teeth or fingers (the tab in the back where the nutrition info is).  It will open the pack right in the middle exposing half of the waffle.  Just hold the half that's still in the package and start eating.  This is the fastest and safest way to consume this product while on the go (I did just that while hiking, holding my poles in one hand and eating this from the other hand).\n\nHaven't tried the chocolate flavor yet but I love all three (strawberry, vanilla, and honey) that I've tried.  Bought Vanilla and Honey from Amazon in bulk.  I know I will finish them based on my scheduled hikes coming up in the remaining 2012.\n\nAt 160 calories, it is a good hourly snack.

Since I don't want to get tired of it, I have been looking for alternative hot breakfast and ended up finding this one.\n\nI had grits for only once in my life time therefore I did not know what to expect.  Granted, this product takes more prep time than instant oatmeal.  After a bit branstorming I found a quicker/no fuss way to fit it into my morning routine.\n\nThe night before I'd put 1/4 cup of it in a bowl and a cup of water, add a bit of salt or chicken stock (powder form), stir and then cover the bowl with a plate.  Let it soak over night.\n\nIn the morning while getting ready for work, I put the bowl with cover in the microwave to zap it for 3 minutes.  When zapping is done, stir a bit and let it sit.  By the time I am ready to eat it, it'd almost be perfectly soft, gooey, and not too hot.\n\nI prefer eating it with dried pork (pork sung) and diced pickled turnips.

There's very little acidity even when cold.  It also doesn't taste strong (after adding more to the cup).  If you prefer mild coffee taste with no acidity, not to mention convenient, this may be a good one to try.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStephen's Gourmet Candycane Hot Cocoa, 1.4-Ounce Packets (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nI tried it during backpacking and at home.  It did not disappoint.  For backpacking I use 8oz hot water but the sweetness is just want I need after a hard day of hauling a 30lb backpack up some elevation and distance.  At home I use 12oz hot water to dilute the sweetness to make it a perfect bed time snack.  The minty flavor from candy cane bits makes a huge difference in taste in comparison to other hot chocolate brands.  The only gripe I have is the packaging.  The packets are too loose inside the box therefore if not sealed well, content will come out to make a mess inside the box.  I had to clean each packet to rid sugared powder before putting them back into the box.  If you have roach, roden, or ant invation at home, you should be very mindful of this potential danger to the storage problem.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['tea', 'use', 'one', 'make', 'flavor', 'taste', 'milk', 'good', 'water', 'like']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nHinterland Trading Two Pack of Air Plant Tillandsia Bromeliads\nReview:\nMy air plants arrived well packaged and in great condition.

It's great for skin, hair, cooking etc.  However this time I received different bottles that are clear and tall - sort of like a mayonnaise jar.  The issue is that this time I have teeny tiny lumps that are VERY hard to melt and have to be crushed between fingernails in order to utilize them.  So... I'm not sure what is up with that as it's not pleasant to rub on, nor is it fun to cook with it because you end up with teeny bumps mixed in with the food.

To jazz things up, I've been adding fruit, peanut butter, coffee, etc.  When I heard about PB2, I decided to give it a try.  The 6.5 oz sizes allow you to give the product a try before committing to a large quantity.  PB2 is very light and powdery.  It takes 2 Tbsp. (45 cal) to give a good peanut flavor.  The regular PB2 is better than the chocolate variety.  The chocolate flavor isn't very intense with more pronounced PB flavor.  It mixes well with the shake mix and tastes good.  The price is high considering the small number of servings you'd get per jar.  This was an ingenious way to make the by-product of pressing peanuts for oil into a valuable commodity!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHershey Holiday Stocking Stuffer Shapes Chocolate Assortment, 23.1 Ounce\nReview:\nThis assortment was appealing for stocking stuffers.

I enjoy it as a snack on its own or sprinkled on fruit or yogurt to add some texture. I do prefer a granola with a bit more crunch, but is not super sweet.  I'm not Vegan or gluten-free, but if you're in either category, this would be a great snack food or topping.  At 200 calories a package, it's not low-cal, but probably better than some other snack foods in that calorie range.

It's a blend of erthritol, sugar, monk fruit extract & molasses. Erthritol (erythritol), listed as the first ingredient, is a sugar alcohol that has been approved for use as a food additive in the US & much of the world.  It occurs naturally in some fruits and fermented foods & is 60-70% as sweet as table sugar, but is almost noncaloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay & is less likely to cause gastric side effects than other sugar alcohols. All of the ingredients are almost noncaloric, but the suggested serving size of 1/4 tsp has virtually no calories.  I find Nectresse to provide sweetness in my tea or coffee without the unpleasant aftertaste of Stevia or Splenda.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSCHARFEEN BERGER Artisan Chocolate Tasting Squares Gift Box, 48 Count\nReview:\nI love chocolate, mostly dark chocolate.

Pairings with various wines are suggested as well.  I don't drink red, so wasn't able to give that a try.  As far as the chocolate goes, this is a nice assortment of milk, semisweet, bittersweet and extra dark in very small squares, about half the size of a Hershey miniature.

Six boxes of Einkorn Berries (still in the shipping container) were stored in a closet for over a year; I had drifted back to a favorite staple: organic short grain brown rice.

This mild-flavored, beneficial oil is also good for lubricating glass and other bakeware when baking casseroles, cornbread, etc.\n\nFor the eggs (I use an egg white and one whole egg per serving - save the extra yolk for other recipes), heat 3/4\" of water in a large saucepan until the water is boiling, then place a small vegetable steamer* in the bottom of the pan and, on top of this, a 10 oz. Pyrex bowl, lightly coated inside with grapeseed oil and containing the egg white.\n\nCover the pan, steam the egg white a few minutes, then add the whole egg, cover and continuing steaming until the poached egg is ready (about 3 more minutes). The cooked egg is easily removed with a spoon but soak the bowl immediately for easy cleanup later.\n\n* I purchased an inexpensive steamer then removed the foldable fins and center post to create a simple platform for the Pyrex bowl (it's wide enough for several bowls in a large saucepan). I usually remove the bowl from the pan before extracting the cooked egg.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['cup', 'stir', 'oil', 'tsp', 'water', 'chocolate', 'coconut', 'add', 'cups', 'try']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nTassimo GEVALIA Dark House Blend Coffee, Extra Bold, 12 Count T-Discs, (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nvery delish but usually prices us out.

Since coffee is the first part of my morning ritual is my beloved cup of coffee.  I've been accustomed to K-cups for so long but were finding them a little too wasteful and costly for my taste.  Instead, I brew a pot of this (most of the times two pots for us) and we can drink this without all of the acidity and stomach issues that a regular cup of coffee can sometimes cause.\n\nThe only difference i notice is in the strength ... I feel like I have to use a little bit more of this coffee to make the pot as strong as I want it.  Still though, this coffee is a stomach saver and I recommend it for anyone who has a tough time with stomach acidity for that morning cup of coffee.  Tastes great too.\n\n26 April 2017 - still drinking this coffee but have alternated it with Breakfast Blend by Folgers which is a milder blend.  This Simply Smooth should be renamed the gut saver ... still works great and for me, a noticeable difference.

Sucralose is Sucralose and that's what Splenda is (with a bulking agent added).\n\nThis box of 400 was a great deal, so I nabbed it.\n\nAs far as the sweetener is concerned, we found that we like this one over aspartame, saccharin, stevia or whatever else is out there.  I only use Splenda to sweeten my hot tea on occasion and my partner uses a packet for her coffee.  It provides a great level of sweetness without the aftertaste.  No aftertaste is the real key for us.\n\nAspartame always gave me a headache, saccharin has a funky aftertaste (I remember drinking&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tab-Diet-Soda-12oz-Cans-Pack-of-6/dp/B0014R6TJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tab Diet Soda 12oz Cans (Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;which was one of the first diet colas when I was growing up and it had that Sweet and Low aftertaste.)

This chocolate fits in perfectly with my type of taste.\n\nI love the Intense Dark 72% bar ... an absolute favorite and after eating between 60%-90%+, I have found my home with this 72% bar.  To me, the perfect combination of sweet and bitter.\n\nWhen I pair this with a nice glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, the complexity of this chocolate comes out and I can taste hints of coconut and coffee beans.  I love it.  Really a nice after dinner treat for me and a way to conquer the sweet tooth.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBuzz and Bloom Honey Creamy Spread, Original, 12 Ounce\nReview:\nI am a huge fan or raw, spun honey.  I love it like I love Maple Syrup.  One of God's great, natural gifts.  That said, sometimes messing with nature doesn't yield the expected consequences.\n\nI love Cinnamon a lot - like cinnamon toast.  Could eat it every day.  :)  I also love spun, creamy honey.  I thought that this honey would contain a subtle touch of cinnamon .... just enough to add character to the concoction.  I was wrong about that!  The cinnamon seems so strong and artificial that it really turned me off - but the packaging says NATURAL cinnamon.  Maybe they need a lot less of it.  The taste of cinammon is the kind of cinnamon you get from a Fireball ... not the kind of cinnamon you get from cinnamon toast.  I was hoping for the latter.\n\nMy Mom (who is 86 and with diminished taste buds) appreciates the honey and does not mind the taste of the cinnamon.  But she could not reconcile the price with the product.  That's not an age thing ... I wouldn't pay the slightly less than $10 for this product.  I also cannot imagine what the Blueberry version tastes like?  Personally, I will stick with&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Y-S-Eco-Bee-Farms-Raw-Honey-22-oz/dp/B000Z93FQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Y.S.

I didn't expect a milky concoction geared to give me energy.  Truly could not get past the first sip and could not encourage anyone in my household to try a sip either.  My guess is that you will either love this drink or dislike it a lot (I'm in the latter group if you cannot tell).\n\nNutritionally it's got a bunch of carbs and sugar - 38 grams in the can.  That's a lot of sugar.  The drink is somewhat thick, overly milky and has a taste of cinnamon (which was not overpowering).  I love cinnamon and would have liked a stronger cinnamon taste to overcome the other tastes ... I am not really sure what they were?!\n\nTo me, a nasty nasty concoction.  I love my Red Bull or even a Rock Star or almost any other energy drink that avoids milk a a main ingredient.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nWERTHER'S ORIGINAL Soft Caramels, Caramel Candy, Individually Wrapped Candy, Bag of Candy, Caramel Sweets, 2.22 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI remember as a kid in the 70's the Kraft Caramels that were buttery smooth and creamy.  You could almost envision and taste a delicious caramel apple from that time.  The caramel taste was very specific.  It lacked that butterscotch \"toffee\" fakeness that abounds in anything caramel these days.  UNTIL these Werther's Original Soft Caramels came on the scene.\n\nThese are delicious and they taste exactly like the Kraft Caramels that I have missed so much over the past 40 years.  I am not sure when Kraft changed their recipe but if you are like me and you long for that recipe from long ago.  These caramels really hit the spot.\n\nThese are distinct from the Werther's hard candy ... totally different. These are not a soft version of their hard candy - these are buttery, creamy caramels.  No toffee taste, no hint of butterscotch ... just caramel.\n\nIf you long for the taste of the older Kraft recipe, these are a great treat that will bring you back.  In their own right, they are a REALLY yummy caramel.  6 pieces to a serving and 160 calories.  They are worth every single calorie.\n\nFeels like a bit of a throwback for me with very sweet memories.  I hope you experience the same thing! :-)  Enjoy!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKashi Heart To Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI really enjoy this cereal right out of the box as a healthier snack or with milk.  It is one of those cereals that passes the milk test with flying colors and will not wilt.  Expect a great, crunchy and nutritious cereal and snack.  It is filling and not overly sweetened.  Other people in my house thinks that the cereal borders on the bland side ... if you are accustomed to Lucky Charms, these definitely will.  But if you are trying to ease your palette into a healthier cereal that is not loaded with sugars, you will like this.\n\nI tend to lean towards Kashi products even though they can be more expensive.  I like the company philosophy and the ingredients.  Not a lot of empty stuff in their products.\n\nThis is a great cereal to ease into as you move away from the surgary stuff.

I had tried one other brand before and it was quite bitter tasting. This cacao tastes fresh, and when mixed with a fruit, walnut and greek yogurt salad for dinner as well as with a hefty morning smoothie (loaded with raw, organic hemp powder and kefir, etc.),it lends a really delicious chocolate flavor.

When opening the bag the aroma was very fresh and  \"coffee-ie\". To me, it is medium bodied but full flavored with absolutely no bitterness. It is very smooth and well-rounded in taste and I noticed no subtle or unique flavors, only an excellent coffee flavor.\n\nI like that it is a medium-dark roast because a medium roast usually lacks boldness whereas a dark roast can be too overbearing with that too toasted, often bitter, taste. This comes off as being the best solution between the two.\n\nThis coffee is so good I can leave it at room temperature for hours in a tight lid jar or thermos, and after SLOWLY reheating it, it will taste just about as good as when first brewed.\n\nThe beans are a combination of 50% Honduran Peaberry/50% Guatemalan San Antonio.\n\nAnd, the price is outstanding for these high quality coffee beans!\n\nThis will be my regular java from now on.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Frontier Kelp Powder Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bags (Pack of 2) \nReview:\nAs far as powdered kelp goes, this is the best I have tasted.

I do blame them for putting a stale product on the market.\n\nI got about an ounce of the almonds to eat with some Greek yogurt and a couple of bananas. The first ones I ate were obviously stale and had absolutely no taste to them....very bland.\n\nThe really bad part came after I had eaten about half of them and got either one or two  nuts that had a sharp, sour taste (rancid) to it, or them.

There is absolutely no taste to them but I \"doctor\" them with Celtic sea salt after soaking 2 tablespoons of seeds to 3 tablespoons of spring water that gives them a very nice flavor. Of course, they can be soaked in almond milk, kefir and the like.\n\nIf taken in the mouth dry, just let them sit there for a minute or 2 and they will develop that enjoyable \"mush\" and are easily chewed. It is recommended that they be eaten only after they have achieved the soft, silky texture so as to better absorb the nutrients.\n\nAfter several days of enjoying them, I do notice a subtle rise is my sustained energy level for a while after eating them, but it is nothing dramatic.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['taste', 'coffee', 'flavor', 'organic', 'good', 'nice', 'really', 'well', 'excellent', 'best']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nEnvirokidz Organic Gluten Free Crispy Rice Bars, Cheetah Berry Blast, 6 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI am an adult and use these for a snack at work.

It is the first thing I crave when I'm hungry and it's the only thing I can keep down when I'm hung-over. Ramyun has been and will always be my comfort food although I consider them very unhealthy. When I first spotted the Black Shin Ramyun on Amazon, I thought it was too expensive and didn't want to buy an entire box especially while I've been trying so hard to stay away from ramyun products to reduce my sodium and other toxic intakes. After many fruitless searches at nearby Asian markets to try a few packets, I ended up getting a case from Amazon after several months of hesitation; what can I say...I have to try all ramyun that I notice. Upon trying, I must say that I'm not disappointed at all and this is my new favorite ramen for the moment. The broth is thicker (from the beef bone extract powder) and has a bit of miso flavor very similar to the restaurant quality Japanese (non-instant) miso ramyun. It is definitely not as spicy as the regular Shin ramyun, but it has much more complex flavor and tastes more home-made with bigger chunks of mushrooms, hot peppers, etc. It is unbelievable that the product is MSG free with its play on all my taste buds, and I was very impressed that the product didn't make me feel as tired as most ramyun usually do after consumption. I'm very happy that I still have many packets left, and I'll savor them for all they're worth, which is actually much cheaper than comparable restaurant ramyun and home-made noodle soups.\n\nupdate 4/4/2013:\nI've subscribed for an auto-delivery subscription and unfortunately have been enjoying the ramen a bit too often. The nutrition fact shows that a package serves 2, but that is unrealistic as most will finish an entire package by themselves. The sodium intake for a package is 1840mg (76% daily value) and total fat of 18g (28% dv) if you finish the soup! The sodium content is actually improved from the original (Gourmet Spicy Picante) Shin ramen's 2100mg. I try to make it a bit less evil by adding some cabbage, green onions and other vegetables for additional roughage and flavors. Adding fresh hot peppers or Jalapeos to the ramen makes it even more amazing. Sometimes I'll even drop an egg for additional protein, but try not to consume the york. I avoid drinking the liquid to cut down on sodium but boy is it hard to stop once you start... Having a constant supply of this ramen is dangerous but I don't have the heart to stop the subscription because I can't find it locally.

The veg flakes have bigger \"stuff\" and the broth tastes deeper, almost as if they're different products.

The Sapporo lacks the dried vegetables and the mustard mayo, but the core flavor is very similar.  You can add your own vegetables as instructed and purchase the Japanese mustard mayo if desired, and you'll spend less than a dollar as to over $3 per each package of Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba.

Although it is still a tasty version of an instant Jjajangmen (all instants are very different from the real thing), it's not noticeably different from the old long-standing chapagetti in its flavor.

I can take spice pretty well, but even then I was a bit scared to try this assuming it's probably a sadistically hot inedible product aspiring fame through people's agony. With the cooked ramyun bowl in front of me, I breathed in deep, meditated a little, and then took the first bite. I must say I was both disappointed and relieved at the same time. It was not nearly as spicy as I had expected, and it was quite tasty! The sauce flavor is akin to the popular Korean dish Ddukbokki, except it's a little more savory (chicken?) and spicier. The sweetness tapers down the level of spice, and I finished the bowl without flinching although my nose pooled sweat long afterwards. As for a relevant gauge, if you enjoy and can eat Buffalo Wild's \"hot\" wings, then you won't have trouble finishing this. I also noticed that many people prep this noodle incorrectly and comment that it lacks flavor.\n\nThere's no English instruction on how to prepare the noodles; No wonder so many people eat it incorrectly on Youtube with excess liquid.\n1. Pour boiling water to the indicated line inside the cup, and wait 4 minutes (put the liquid flavor pack on top of the cup to heat it during this process).\n2. Open the lid and stir the noodles well with chopsticks [or fork], then pour out all excess water. Add the liquid pack and mix in well.\n3. Add the dry flake pack and consume.\n\nI've tried the cooking pack version of this (not instant cup), and I prefer the cooking packs hands down. You get 140g of noodles in the pack instead of 70g (small cup) or 105g (big cup) instant versions, and the thicker noodles taste more savory and dare I say even more spicy when prepared correctly.  If you like the cup, you'll love the packs. I'm knocking out one star here because I don't like the thinner noodles in the cup version and they cost too much despite the convenience. I'm going to stick to the pack version from now on.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSempio Bibim Spicy Noodle Sauce, 11.29 Ounce\nReview:\nThis is a tasty sauce to mix in with rice or thin noodles.

It is fair traded and organic, and a win all around - just be moderate, it's addictive!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nQuinn Snacks Microwave Popcorn - Made with Organic Non-GMO Corn - Great Snack Food for Movie Night - Parmesan &amp; Rosemary, 7 Ounce (3 Count)\nReview:\nAbsolutely love this popcorn. No nasty chemicals in the bag lining. Only thing you have to really watch the time, it burns easily so start out with two minutes. More than enough sunflower oil and seasoning in the packets for one bag, or even use part of it if you want to cut down on oil, just so buttery delicious and good. I got the butter and sea salt, and also the maple syrup, both great, but butter and sea salt my favorite.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGrassfed Organic Ghee 7.8 Oz - Pure Indian Foods Brand (6-Pack)\nReview:\nI do watch my fat intake but also realize that good fats are necessary to health, and even some saturated fats in small amounts (in fact I believe recent studies back this up), I've always hated margarine and butter substitutes so if I'm going to use it I want the real thing. The organic and grass fed means it is high in vitamin K, which is hard to come by, and has a host of health benefits. Everyone always compliments me on my skin and I think the healthy fats I consume (avocado, nuts olive oil, coconut oil and this butter), play a role (in addition to healthy lifestyle and skin care regimen).\n\nAnd because it is SO flavorful, you may need only a dab to get that butter 'fix'. I like a dab on my oatmeal on my flax toast or even on a vanilla or tapioca pudding (I make a lower sugar version). That buttery flavor really harmonizes with the vanilla!\n\nYou might be able to find it for somewhat less in a retail store, but I order many grocery /gourmet items here from Amazon so I like the convenience.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nArtisana Organics - Cashew Butter, Certified organic, RAW and non-GMO, no added sugar or oil, rich and creamy\nReview:\nLuxuriously delicious, subtle slightly sweet flavor, it is good fats, but still be careful with quantities if you need to watch our weight! It can be addictive!\n\nScrumptious low glycemic raw vegan treat recipe made with this:\n\n1/3 cup (or so) of cashew butter\na few tablespoons of Sunfoods Raw Cacao powder (or other cacao powder)\ntablespoon of coconut nectar (or to taste)\ntsp of vanilla\ndash of salt\n\n(optional - ground almonds or walnuts for crunchy texture, or coconut)\n\nUse the amounts in the recipe that taste good to you - I don't like things super sweet, and the cashew butter has an innate sweetness)\n\nSmoosh ingredients all together in a bowl with clean hands or forks (hands work best, messy as it is), make them into little balls and put on a cookie sheet with waxed paper in the freezer for an hour or two (then store in the refrigerator).\n\nYou never tasted anything so decadent and delicious, and it is all organic and healthy !

(Sadly these days counterfeit honey is a rampant problem - the raw stuff is hard to counterfeit, but rest assured this is an ethical supplier.\n\nThe health benefits of raw honey are many as it's a live food, full of enzymes, and acts as prebiotic (containing substances that contribute to a healthier gut and flora in the entire body).\n\nIt is hard to avoid completely all the processed, 'dead' foods in the modern world, that do little more than add calories and contribute to disease, so adding things like this to our diet, can help a lot.\n\nI like it in tea, I put it in the cup first and then pour in the hot water and stir it.\n\nI especially love it in a broccoli salad I make - using chopped/grated broccoli stalks & carrots,  organic raisins or dried cherries, and Vegenaise with a tablespoon of this honey -- it is DELICIOUS and a sweet tooth satisfier!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBare Fruit Organic Granny Smith Apple Chips, Gluten-Free + Baked, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nFirst of all - conventional apples are one of the 'dirty dozen' of produce to avoid, so finding an organic version of dried apples to snack on is wonderful. I first got these at Costco like others here, but I am going to order here now.\n\nThey are nice alone - but try them with a bit of organic raw cheese, some pistachios or healthy crackers - delicious! The combination of the tangy with the salty /creamy is mouth watering and satisfying.\n\nMuch preferable if you are having a sweet tooth to do this as opposed to candy or pastry. You do have to watch the quantities because the sugar grams will add up, even though it is natural fruit sugar.\n\nI really encourage parents to get these for their kids as a snack, and try them with cheese or something salty.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n3 Small Venus Flytraps - Fly Trap - (Dionaea Muscipula) Carnivorous Plant 3 Inch Pot\nReview:\nI will echo other reviewers about how responsive and responsible the seller is. The plant arrived quickly with good instructions, and the seller even followed up to see how it was doing. It's a fascinating plant with its opening and closing 'mouth' and the fact that it's carnivorous! I got it hoping it would help with my fruit fly issues. I haven't seen anything catch anything so far, but maybe needs to grow bigger to do that. I\n\n have it in a sunny window and keep the bowl it sits in 1/3 filled with distilled water, as instructed. Have to watch out for water evaporation in that sunny window, but so far the plant seems to be doing well.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Organic, non-GMO, Premium Ground Chia Seeds\nReview:\nIt's so tough to know what to eat these days, with everything tainted one way or another from our sorry environment, or ecologically unsustainable etc, so good to find something that is nutritious and doesn't make you sick or is ecologically unsustainable.\n\nChia seeds are delicious, packed with health benefits, including adding beneficial fiber, which most of us need more of than we're getting. Supposed to get 25 grams minimum per day.\n\nI have enjoyed the cold glassed chia beverages that are sold at Whole Foods, but that are expensive, so I tried to duplicate something like that at home and came out well!\n\nI made some iced tea (used raspberry and green tea combo, but you could use anything you like), then added some raw honey (melted with warm water, since honey should not be over heated), and lemon juice, then poured in several tablespoons of the chia seeds into the tea in  a glass jar, and voila! A healthy wonderful beverage for pennies.\n\nThe chia seeds are suspended, but do tend to drift downwards so you will need to stir it up first. I also sometimes add some liquid probiotic (I like coconut kefir), for extra benefit. Be aware though with all the benefits of chia, it does have some calorie heft (60 calories per tablespoon), although doubtless some of it is not absorbed due to the fiber.\n\nIf you add it to your smoothie - be sure to add it last so it doesn't make it too gelatinous, which it will if it sits long.\n\nFor tapioca like pudding: If you soak it in your favorite nut milk a few hours in the fridge (or overnight), adding a healthier sweetener and some vanilla, you will have a yummy smooth dessert that is actually good for you.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKevala Organic Toasted Sesame Oil, 8 Ounce\nReview:\nI cook a lot and sesame oil is a staple for me. What I love about it is not just the wonderful nutty smoky taste, but that just a few drops can add so much flavor, especially together with a little tamari and fish sauce (in rice, stir fries, and various Asian dishes).\n\nI love that it's organic, and the taste really is rich and strong,and its a good size, not the tiny bottles that are more readily available in the stores.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPlanters Trail Mix, Sweet &amp; Salty 6 Oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nFor some reason sunflower seeds have become difficult to find in grocery stores.

Rather than completely cutting out bread, I make a multi grain bread substituting 1/4 of the flours with coconut flour. I use some whole wheat, rye, buckwheat, flax and oats. All organic, found here on Amazon. I am not gluten sensitive, so I add a couple tablespoons to get a better rise. There are many web sites for using this flour to make breads, muffins pizza dough, and other things without gluten and other grains. We eat the bread sparingly of course. At first I was disturbed by the use of so many eggs in the preparation of \"bread\" using only coconut flour. However, I have recently read the best selling book \"The Great Cholesterol Myth\" by Jonny Bowden.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Great-Cholesterol-Myth/dp/1592335217/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Great Cholesterol Myth</a>(Available on Amazon, of course).\n\nIf it is true that we have been misled regarding cholesterol and eggs, (by the drug companies)  then using them with this flour is not going to cause a problem. One fourth cup contains 22 carbs and 16 grams of fiber. I have seen it said that this makes the flour a net carb serving of 6 grams.

Dr. Gregor compared the benefits and antioxidant power between the green and white tea.  White tea is  less processed than the green, and the most processed is the black tea.  White has even more benefits when lemon juice is added. The best news is that cold brewed  tea is as beneficial as hot brewed.\n\n I make a three quart pitcher with 8 white tea bags and two bags of Celestial brand cinnamon apple spice tea. I add a half cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of Truvia.  This is cold brewed overnight.

I have incorporated them into my homemade granola too. 1/4 cup contains about an ounce of dried berries, and is considered a daily serving of about 100 calories.\n\nI understand these are very easy to grow in containers and I am looking into purchasing a few plants. I have a dehydrator which will be vey useful, I'm sure. I'm very pleased with these overall, but they are expensive and if I can learn to grow my own, I will be even happier.\n\nP.S.

I purchased these chives along with the quart of dried tomato. I use both in breads, soups, omelets, salad dressings and lots of other things. The best feature is the long shelf life at room temperature. The chives are fresh and pungent. More so than the fresh from the supermarket. Since they are dried, they are more concentrated and you only need a small amount for great chive flavor.

I've been buying their products for over 20 years and have never been disappointed. I've been cooking meals for over 45 years, and almost always used dried herbs, and this is the best dried sweet basil I've tasted. I cant make my tomato sauce without it. It tastes great, plus it's non-GMO & organic! Great taste and aroma, as fresh as dried can be.\n\nThis is the same product as Simply Organic basil (same company) you get in a .54 ounce glass jar. I recommend buying one jar (see link below), then buy this 16 ounce bag to refill the jar. You get nearly 30 refills in one bag! That's well over $110 worth of refills! The one pound bag is a great bargain and is enough for you and a friend. You can't go wrong. Great product, buy in bulk to save money. I buy most of my herbs and spices from Frontier and Simply organic in the same way - I buy one jar of Simply Organic and refill with their Frontier Organic bulk products.\n\nComes in a well sealed Mylar bag that can last for a couple of years if kept well sealed. And if you have any questions, the people at Frontier and Simply Organic are very friendly and always helpful.\n\nWhat is SWEET Basil?\nSweet basil (Ocimum basilicum), also called basic basil, Mediterranean or European-type basil, and is the most common basil grown, sold and used in the United States. Its most often used in Italian cooking and in soups but can also be used in Asian dishes such as Thai (as a replacement for Thai basil).\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Simply-Organic-Basil-Certified-Organic-0-54-Ounce-Container/dp/B000WS08YI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Simply Organic Basil Certified Organic, 0.54-Ounce Container</a>\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHeinz Twin Pack Organic Tomato Ketchup, 88 Ounce\nReview:\nThis is my fallback organic ketchup brand. I've tried many others, but I only like Heinz and Annie's so far. I prefer Annie's Organic Ketchup but I can't always find it in local stores or online at a decent price. So, when I can't get Annie's I get Heinz. There is a difference in taste from Annie's to Heinz and from Heinz Organic to Heinz regular. Heinz Organic has a bit of a bite to it (compared to regular Heinz), but not so much that you don't get use to eat by the end of your first meal. Just like anything else, once you get use to it you have trouble going back to what you use to eat (regular Heinz). So, if you can get Annie's Organic Ketchup I recommend it, but if you can't, try this and I don't think you'll be unhappy at all.\n\nPS) Annie's has a completely different taste, not as sweet as Heinz, with more of a robust, rich, deeper flavor. It takes getting use to too, but I hate regular ketchup after eating Annie's.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAnnie's Organic Saltine Classic, Baked Crackers, 6.5 oz (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nMY REVIEW:\nHere's my review of Annie's Organic Saltine Classics (what Amazon is calling \"Bunny Classic Crackers Saltines\"):\n\nI love them. I prefer them over Nabisco Premium (my old favorite) for many reasons. First is the flavor; Annie's Saltines taste like traditional oyster crackers. I didn't realize it until after I tasted them, but I prefer the flavor of oyster crackers over traditional saltines. But I think they taste more like Westminster brand oyster crackers (a richer flavor) than Premium or Sunshine brand oyster crackers. They're also not too salty, light but crisp & crunchy, and of course the fact that they're organic is a huge plus. They taste great with cheese slices or spread. They also hold up well when spreading peanut butter & jelly, butter, or cream cheese on them.\n\nAdded on 11-9-14: The price has gone from $19 to $29 since my purchase. This product is not worth $5 a box so I am now ordering Late July brand, which is currently $38 for 12 (about $3.15 per box). If Amazon keeps raising prices to ridiculous amounts they're going to loose my business as well as thousands, if not millions, of other consumers.\n\nSee below for cautions regarding reviews/ratings, return policy, confusing item names, and more.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nRETURN POLICY:\nOne huge caution before you buy - Grocery Items Can NOT Be Returned, for any reason, as per Amazon's return policy. I'm normally a huge fan of Amazon and their more than fair return policy, but when it comes to grocery items their return policy falls short, since some grocery items may be damaged by mishandling or improper storage, may have gone bad, etc. I personally would have no problem ordering Annie's Saltines again, even with this return policy, because I have faith in most items shipped from Amazon. However, I did receive other grocery items in the past that I felt were not up to par and could not return them.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nSHIPPING & CONDITION OF PRODUCT:\nAlthough this is not reflected in my star rating, I should mention how well they were packaged and that they were not damaged in shipping. The six boxes were wrapped together and shipped in a box with air pack cushioning. Only one or two crackers were broken in each box, at most, and I suspect that happened in the factory. I ordered them in July 2014 and the product expiration printed on the box was March 2015. So consumers who are worried about getting broken or expired product, I have had no problem with these issues.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nMISLEADING STAR RATINGS:\nI've tried many different Annie's crackers & cookies. Some I give 5 stars, some 1 star. It should be noted that the star ratings on this page are MISLEADING. As of August 2014 Amazon is lumping several Annie's Cracker flavor reviews together. This means the star rating you see is for ALL the flavors combined. Each flavor is and should be considered a separate product with their own rating, but they are not. The only way for sure to know how other consumers rate each flavor is for you to pay close attention to the details of the review. If the reviewer's purchase is verified Amazon will post which flavor they're reviewing, but you must look closely at the review to see this. It's easily overlooked. For those reviewers whose purchase is not verified by Amazon, there may be no way to know which flavor they're reviewing.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nCONFUSING ITEM NAMES:\nThe titles (names) Amazon shows for these products sold on this page are also misleading. Even though Annie's has stopped making some of their crackers in the shape of a bunny, and have changed the names & packaging of these products to reflect this, as of July 2014 Amazon has not changed the names of the products sold on this page. This may cause consumers to be confused about which products they're buying, or what they'll get. The list below may be helpful.\n\nAnnie's makes many different kinds of crackers & cookies. Most of them use to be bunny shaped, some are organic while others are not, many have similar names. To help you understand the different cracker & cookie flavors and shapes, here is the breakdown of what is being offered on this page, as of August 3, 2014. There are four different crackers:\n\nAnnie's Homegrown Organic Saltine Classics (hexagon shaped)\nAmazon title: Annie's Homegrown Organic Bunny Classic Crackers Saltines\n\nAnnie's Homegrown Organic Cheddar Classics (hexagon shaped)\nAmazon title: Annie's Homegrown Organic Bunny Classic Crackers Buttery Rich\n\nAnnie's Homegrown Organic Buttery Rich Classics (hexagon shaped)\nAmazon title: Annie's Homegrown Organic Bunny Classic Crackers Cheddar\n\nAnnie's Homegrown Organic Cheddar Bunnies (bunny shaped)\nAmazon title: Annie's Homegrown Organic Cheddar Bunnies\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nMAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING THE RIGHT PRODUCT:\nBecause you might be looking for a cracker or cookie that's not listed above, and you may be wondering if the cracker or cookie you want is still made or discontinued, I thought it might be helpful to list what Annie's currently makes, with a notation as to which ones are currently being sold on this page (as of August 3, 2014). I'd link to all of them, so you can find them quicker, but Amazon only allows 10 links per review:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cheddar-Bunnies-not-all-organic-but-made-with-organic-wheat-bunny-shaped/dp/B000CQ25UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cheddar Bunnies (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (bunny shaped)</a>\nOrganic Cheddar Bunnies (bunny shaped) - currently sold through this page\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/White-Cheddar-Bunnies-not-all-organic-but-made-with-organic-wheat-bunny-shaped/dp/B000I5NAHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">White Cheddar Bunnies (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (bunny shaped)</a>\nBernie's Farm Cheddar Crackers (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (different colored farm related shapes, naturally colored)\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Whole-Wheat-Cheddar-Bunnies-not-all-organic-but-made-with-organic-wheat-bunny-shaped/dp/B000CQ01ME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Whole Wheat Cheddar Bunnies (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (bunny shaped)</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Extra-Cheesy-Cheddar-Bunnies-not-all-organic-but-made-with-organic-wheat-bunny-shaped/dp/B00D7D1YNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Extra Cheesy Cheddar Bunnies (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (bunny shaped)</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sour-Cream-Onion-Bunnies-not-all-organic-but-made-with-organic-wheat-bunny-shaped/dp/B000CQ6KVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sour Cream & Onion Bunnies (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (bunny shaped)</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Honey-Bunny-Grahams-not-all-organic-but-made-with-organic-wheat-bunny-shaped/dp/B000VK43BG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Honey Bunny Grahams (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (bunny shaped)</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cinnamon-Bunny-Grahams-not-all-organic-but-made-with-organic-wheat-bunny-shaped/dp/B000CQ6KR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cinnamon Bunny Grahams (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (bunny shaped)</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Chocolate-Chip-Bunny-Grahams-not-all-organic-but-made-with-organic-wheat-bunny-shaped/dp/B000I5NAI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chocolate Chip Bunny Grahams (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (bunny shaped)</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Chocolate-Bunny-Grahams-not-all-organic-but-made-with-organic-wheat-bunny-shaped/dp/B000VK43A2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Chocolate Bunny Grahams (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (bunny shaped)</a>\nFriends Bunny Grahams (mix of Honey Graham, Chocolate Chip Graham, and Chocolate Graham flavors), (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (bunny shaped)\nSnickerdoodle Cinnamon Sugar Bunny Cookies (gluten-free, peanut-free), (not organic), (bunny shaped)\nGinger Snap Bunny Cookies (gluten-free), (not organic), (bunny shaped)\nCocoa & Vanilla Bunny Cookies (gluten-free), (not organic), (bunny shaped)\n\nOrganic Saltine Classics (hexagon shaped) - currently sold through this page\nOrganic Buttery Rich Classics (hexagon shaped) - currently sold through this page\nOrganic Cheddar Classics (hexagon shaped) - currently sold through this page\n\nCheddar Squares (not all organic, but made with organic wheat), (square shaped, similar to Cheez-Its shape)\n\nOrganic Honey Grahams (shaped similar to Honey Maid brand graham crackers)\nOrganic Cinnamon Grahams (shaped similar to Honey Maid brand graham crackers)\n\nAnnie's also makes snack mixes, pretzels, gummy style bunnies, and some foods other than snacks.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nI'm not an Annie's representative.

But since they're healthier I pay the price (as long as they don't go more than $4 a box)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWoodstock Organic Smooth Peanut Butter, Salt Added, 35 oz\nReview:\nI love the flavor and ingredients of Woodstock Organic Smooth Peanut Butter, but I will NOT buy it in a plastic jar. I don't have to buy it to know PLASTIC IS TOXIC. I don't know why they changed it (use to come in glass) but I'm moving to another brand if they don't go back to glass jars. Again, plastic is toxic, and they should know this. Storing an organic product long term in a plastic jar is ridiculous! How something tastes is not the only mark of the item's quality - how it's made and how it's stored, if it is stored in toxic plastic, makes a difference and that's why I give this product 3 stars instead of the 5 stars I give to Woodstock in glass jars. They're doing this for cost savings, because it costs less to ship, but that savings is surely not passed on to consumers. And even if it were, I would not want to eat peanut butter stored in toxic plastic. They're lucky I'm giving it 3 stars.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSanta Cruz Organic, 100% Lemon Juice, 16 Ounces\nReview:\nI like the taste - tastes very close to fresh squeezed lemon juice and has a stronger flavor than the juice found in squeeze bottles. It can be used to make great tasting lemonade (don't forget to add sugar), but I prefer to mix it with grape juice (or other juices and juice blends) for a concoction that helps to relieve kidney stones. If you use it for this reason you should take 2-4 ounces a day. And yes, it helps relieve very painful kidney stones. I also love that it's organic.\n\nI've used Santa Cruz brand and Sicilia squeeze bottle. Santa Cruz brand is best for making the freshest tasting lemonade or punch, but Sicilia is best if you want to always have some on hand (and don't have room in the fridge), or if you need just a little squeeze on fish now and then, and for traveling (Sicilia does not need refrigeration until it's opened): Sicilia&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Organic-Lemon-Juice-4-oz/dp/B00E3K182M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Organic Lemon Juice, 4 oz</a>\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Co-op Organic Mediterranean Oregano Leaf, Cut &amp; Sifted, Fancy Grade, 1 Pound Bulk Bag\nReview:\nIm a foodie. I love to eat and I love to cook, especially for friends and family. So talking about food and recipe ingredients for me is kind of like a sports nut talking about his favorite players. So please forgive me if I get a bit overly enthused by something as seemingly insignificant as a common spice  because its not insignificant at all. If you don't yet grow your own herbs and spices, and you want to create delicious meals, you have to find a good, wholesome, organic product line or herbs and spices. And as far as Im concerned, thats Frontier.\n\nIve been buying nearly all of my bottled (and bagged) herbs and spices from Frontier for well over 20 years and Im always happy with the quality, freshness, aroma, and taste. Ive been buying their Simply Organic line for at least 10 years. For those who don't know, Frontier is the same company as Simply Organic. This bag or organic oregano is the same exact ingredients you get from this bottle of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Simply-Organic-Oregano-Leaf-Cut-Sifted-Certified-Organic-75-Ounce-Container/dp/B000WS3APW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Simply Organic Oregano Leaf Cut & Sifted Certified Organic, .75-Ounce Container</a>. The only difference is the packaging and the price. This 16 ounce bag of Frontier Organic oregano is the equivalent of 21 Simply Organic .75 ounce jars (again, same company, same product). If you bought 21 jars it would cost you well over $60, so this is a great product and a great bulk deal.\n\nI started using Frontier & Simply Organic products when I discovered Simply Organic in my local health food store, then I found it in bags online for a great price. If you want quality organic ingredients AND you want to save money, I suggest you buy a bottle of Simply Organic Oregano once, save the bottle, and refill from this huge Mylar bag. It's economical and good for the environment to refill your bottle in this way. Thats how I buy most of my spices these days  organic and in bulk. And I use it in so many recipes: pasta sauces, soups, hot & cold salads, home made dressings, appetizers, garlic bread....\n\nI even have my husband getting into it - ever since he took a wiff of a bag when I first opened it, he's been hooked. That's how fragrant it is. He can't eat a slice of pizza without sprinkling Frontier Oregano and Simply Organic crushed red pepper on top. Between the two of us I cant keep my pantry stocked with it unless I buy it in bulk.\n\nWhy Mediterranean Oregano?\nMediterranean Oregano is the same oregano most of us in the U.S. are use to buying right off the grocery store shelf for years, without thinking what kind it is. Mediterranean oregano: is a member of the mint family and is sometimes called wild marjoram.  Mediterranean oregano has a robust, savory, peppery flavor, which is why its so often used in Greek, Italian, and All-American recipes. On the other hand, Mexican oregano is a member of lemon verbena family. It's native to Mexico and grows throughout Central and South America and is sometimes called Puerto Rican oregano.  Mexican oregano has a citrusy tang and slight licorice flavor, and is used most often in Latin American and Tex-Mex recipes.\n\nSo now you know what Mediterranean Oregano is. And I highly recommend, instead of buying the same OLD stuff off your grocery store shelves, not knowing what chemicals might be used to grow or process it), that you buy a large economical bag of freshly dried ORGANIC oregano from Frontier. Its a great bargain and it always smells and tastes great.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFresh Gourmet Specialty Croutons, Ciabatta Butter and Sea Salt, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 9)\nReview:\nIve been taste testing organic croutons for the last few months and found my favorite is Fresh Gourmet brand Seasoned. I like that they're large (so I can get my fork into them) but they're light (in weight). And I like that they're perfectly seasoned to suit just about any type of salad, including Caesar salads (even though this product is not Caesar salad type seasoning it works perfectly for Caesar salads, and if you want traditional Caesar salad croutons they make those also). The seasoning for this product is mild enough to not overpower your salad or your favorite salad dressing. And they're always perfectly toasted.\n\nI found I eat more salads if I put croutons on them, and I want to eat healthy, so its important that the croutons I buy not only taste good but they must not be laden with too much sugar, fat, or artificial ingredients. Fresh Gourmet fits that description  fresh, healthy/organic, and yummy. PS) There are 35 calories for about 18 croutons (10 fat calories). It's 30 total calories for the Fresh Gourmet Caesar croutons.\n\nI didn't buy from Amazon this time around (because I needed them right now) but the current price here is less than what I pay locally so if the price doesnt go much higher ($2.50 is the max I want to pay per bag for this item) Ill buy them here next. But to prove I do in fact buy and eat this product Ive included a photo. Its a photo of my comparison between Fresh Gourmet and Edward & Sons. Both are on the salad. If you look at the photo youll see the larger tan colored (nicely toasted) croutons are the Fresh Gourmet. The smaller gray colored oily looking croutons are Edward & Sons.\n\nI must say I'm not thrilled with Edward & Sons brand (bag on the right in my photo, the smaller croutons on the salad) because they have an oily smell, taste, and feel. They even look oily (and gray colored). I prefer the Fresh Gourmet brand (the bag on the left, the larger toasty looking croutons in the salad) because they're big, chunky, with a nice flavor but not too much oil. In fact I cant even detect any oil taste with the Fresh Gourmet brand.\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nI couldn't find an ingredients list here or on the Fresh Gourmet website so Im including it, copied from the back of the bag:\n\nINGREDIENTS:\nOrganic Wheat Flour, Organic Sunflower and/or Organic Safflower Oil, Organic Cracked Rye, Organic Cracked Wheat, Yeast, 2% or less of salt, Organic Sugar, Organic Wheat Gluten, Organic Garlic Powder, Organic Dehydrated Parsley, Organic Onion Powder. (packaged in a facility that also packages tree nuts)\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nCertified Organic by QAI:\n\nUSDA/National Organic Program\nQAI is a USDA-accredited certifying agency (ACA), approved to provide organic certification in accordance with the USDA's National Organic Program. Certification is important for consumers, the industry and the regulatory community in order to assure organic integrity from farm to retail shelf. A product marked \"certified organic\" means that an accredited certifying agency, such as QAI, has verified that the product labeled as \"organic\" is true to that organic labeling claim, as specified by the National Organic Program in accordance with the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990.\n\nThe National Organic Standard (NOS) is a federal regulation created by the USDA and administered by the National Organic Program. The USDA Organic Seal and the QAI Seal both stand for assurance that a product on which those seals appear has been verified as certified organic in compliance with the strict USDA federal regulations for organic.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDole Fruit Bowls, Tropical Fruit in 100% Juice, 4 Cups\nReview:\nIn my humble opinion, Dole makes the best pineapple on the planet!\n\nI've been eating canned and packaged pineapple regularly (at least once a week for over 40 years) and I've tried several brands. No one even comes close to the great taste and texture of Dole pineapple. Always sweet and juicy, always ripe, always firm enough (but not mushy), never tuff. And they're Non-GMO. I can't say these things about any other brand I've tried. Plus, these tidbits are packed in 100% pineapple juice, no sugars or artificial sweeteners, no syrup, no other miscellaneous juices. And, the plastic cups are BPA-free.\n\nI usually eat their canned pineapple (chunks, rings, and tidbits) but I started buying the smaller size (these, tidbits in BPA-free plastic cups) so I could take them camping and on road trips. Theyre just as good as their canned pineapple chunks (the size most consumers are use to), maybe even better. Im starting to lean towards liking the tidbits more than the chunks because they seem even more tender and juicy than the chunks.\n\nAnd they don't need refrigeration until opened (and with this size youll eat it all so refrigeration is not an issue). They're easy to open (even for a child or someone with dexterity issues) and just the right size for one person for a snack or desert. I've even opened and eaten them one-handed when I had an operation on my arm (took the lid off with my teeth and slurped it up - no need for a spoon).\n\nOther reasons I like Dole:\nI once watched a food mini documentary on TV that explained how Dole pioneered the growing and packaging of pineapple  right down to creating a new breed of pineapple thats perfect for canning. I also like that Dole has been named as one of the \"World's Most Ethical Companies\" by Ethisphere Magazine. And Dole recognizes the importance of a plant based diet for good health, publishing books and classroom curriculum to help teachers and children learn about healthy eating.\n\nAnd every time I've purchased \"canned\" foods from Amazon they've arrived quickly and in perfect condition. And the expiration dates are always far enough away that I can store them in my pantry and not have to worry about eating them all at one time or before I need them.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['organic', 'like', 'amazon', 'taste', 'get', 'price', 'best', 'good', 'eat', 'also']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nRicochet , Cherry Blast, 100-Count Mints, 1.76 oz (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nVery weak flavor and last only about 45 seconds in the mouth.\nWhat's the point of taking the mint if it does almost nothing.\nI was an sugar contained Altoids user for 9 years.\nI'm going to try these next: Eclipse Sugarfree Mints, and Spry Mints.\nWell, I've tried the Eclipse Sugarfree Mints and they are much stronger and last a lot longer.

I've been drinking P G Tips since my first trip to England back in the 1980's but have often had trouble finding a source for purchasing it here.  I got it from British food importers for many years, then my local grocery stores began to stock it.  Except they don't always have it on the shelf and I often have to visit several stores to find it.  Amazon has definitely solved that problem for me.\n\nI really enjoy drinking this particular tea.  It is a very mild tea, without the harsh flavor some other black teas can have.  Since I make at least two pots of tea each day (and sometimes more) this lovely large quantity will come in very handy and keep my pantry stocked for a long time to come.  It was also much cheaper to buy in this larger size than the 40 count boxes I find in my stores, plus no sales tax and the additional savings of the Amazon Prime membership came in very handy with eliminating the shipping charges.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

This was not the case with this oatmeal!  I actually loved this oatmeal with out wanting to add sugar or flavoring to it.  I liked the cinnamon flavor and did not feel it was too much and did not feel it was too little.

The chocolate bar is very unique, expensive looking, and pleasing to the eye.\n\nFirst off I want to say that I am a dark person, that is why I wanted to try these bars so badly.  No where on any of the packaging does is it indicated the percentage of cocoa in this chocolate, it is only mentioned on the product page that it is 54%.  Also, I waited to write this review until my sample of the dark blueberry arrived so I had something to compare this to.\n\nThe price is about $17 for two bars with shipping costs included.  Each bar is nearly 7 ounces.  When compared to Green & Black's which is a bar I have bought in the past all too many times, the price is actually really similar when taking into account the cost of shipping being rolled into the price given that these Cailler bars are twice the weight of a Green & Black bar.\n\nCailler's dark chocolate is very rich and smooth and not at all bitter or chalky or hard or crunchy.  The texture and flavor, however, may be a result of the relatively low cocoa percentage compared to many other dark chocolates I am used to eating which are all above 65% and most 70% or above.  Research states that the health benefits of dark chocolate do not kick in until a certain threshold of cocoa content has been passed which Cailler's dark chocolate is no where near, so don't think you are doing your body good eating one ounce of this a day.\n\nI like almonds and the cranberries gave this a nice kick, the flavor really popped, like dark chocolate over an orange jelly.  I did feel, however, that because of the almonds and cranberry content that there was less chocolate in each bite than I'd have liked.\n\nI don't have a sweet tooth, I have a whole sweet mouth.  I can sit down and eat and entire Green & Black's bar in one sitting and barely bat an eyelash.  This bar seemed so rich to me that after four pieces (one row) I was able to put it down and walk away, even for the rest of the day.  This is nice for me because it means that this chocolate would last for me and that I won't over do it on this either.\n\nI also like that while Nestle may be the parent company now this chocolate is still actually made in Switzerland as it had been before Nestle.\n\nWould I buy this again?  Yes, but I might wait until I can find it in stores so that I am not paying a higher price because of shipping.\n\nSo, why not five stars?  Cost, not enough chocolate in each bite due to fruit and nut content, lower cocoa content than I'd like.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSalted White Truffle Grass-Fed Ghee Butter by 4th &amp; Heart, 9 Ounce,Pasture Raised, Non-GMO, Lactose Free, Certified Paleo, 9 oz\nReview:\nFirst I want to say that the only other ghee I have tried is Purity Farms.  Next, I only have used ghee for baking purposes, for making things the most flaky possible when making puff pastry and when working with phyllo dough as clarified butter, I think, really makes a difference.  For our regular butter that we keep in our butter dish we ALWAYS buy grass fed, we used to get Pastureland which is the best but that hasn't been available in over a year so we did a taste test between Kalona and Organic Valley and we now buy Kalona Supernatural.  Anyway, when I saw this sample pack by 4th & Heart I though what would I do with it all and what would I do with the different flavors.  Then I started thinking how the vanilla would be neat in pastries, and how the garlic could make easy garlic bread, the item description talked about just using it as a spread.  So, I tried it, and now I can't stop eating the stuff.\n\nI want to start with the fact that this is grass fed.  I attached a photo of the original 4th & Heart ghee next to my Purity Farms ghee and you can see the huge color difference, and no, there is no color added to the 4th & Heart, the deeper yellow comes from the cows having been grass fed.  Grass fed dairy is higher in many, many nutrients but most notable in my mind are conjugated linoleic acid and vitamin K2.  K2 is a big deal because it is hard to get natural unless you eat a lot of seaweed and it makes a huge difference in calcium being deposited where it should go, in bones, not in arteries.  CLA is good for maintaining muscle mass and metabolism and also helps keep cancer away.  Now, on to taste.\n\nOur first tasting was on 100% whole wheat bagels just as spread, everyone in the family tried all five flavors.  Since then we have been eating daily.\n\nOH MY GOD did just the plain unsalted original have amazing sting butter flavor, this stuff will spoil you.  Kids liked it too, husband loved how buttery it tasted.  Would definitely buy this again.\n\nWe eat pink Himalayan sea salt at home as our usual salt, so I thought it was great that this was what 4th & Heart uses.  The flavor of this ghee was also fantastic.  That being said, the amount of salt in this the is more than twice that of Kalona Supernatural grass-fed butter we usually eat.  But still, it tastes really good :)  Kids and hubby really liked this flavor as well.\n\nThe vanilla is delicious and the kids now ask for it at breakfast.  There is nothing but clarified butter and vanilla in this yet it seems to have a sweet taste to it, and it brings out the sweetness in in anything it is mixed with.  The kids now request this butter on their bagels, toast, and english muffins which we usually serve with a little maple sugar sprinkled on top and the mix of the vanilla with the maple sugar is wonderful, and because of the added sweetness of the vanilla ghee I can actually cut way back in the maple sugar I sprinkle and the kids don't notice or care.  I have not yet tried baking with this, we have been enjoying all the flavors so much as just plain spreads that I may never bake with it as we most likely will just eat it all as is.\n\nThe garlic smells so heavenly and intense, but the flavor was just not there, it was so odd to smell so much garlic and then taste next to none, I was disappointed thinking my grand plans of super fast and easy and delicious garlic bread using this stuff and ciabatta bread were dashed.  It took me a few times of using it to figure out that there was no salt added to the garlic and this might make a difference.  So, I tried adding a little of my own salt and voila, there was the garlic flavor I was looking for, just not as strong as it smells though.  I like this so much that I have been using the garlic with added salt on my bagels as a savory bagel instead of going with something sweet.  I have not yet tried garlic bread, but will be buying ciabatta in a few days when we next go grocery shopping.  My kids did not care for this one, no big surprise there for me, and my husband agreed with me that the smell was fantastic but that the garlic flavor was just not there.  he has not yet tried it with salt, but I am sure he'd agree with me that salt brought out the garlic flavor.\n\nI have never tried white truffle anything before though I have seen the oil around a lot lately.  This flavor ghee really did nothing for any of us, no one particularly cared for it but it certainly wasn't bad tasting though.  I told my mom about it and I swear she was salivating through the phone, so I may give her the rest of the jar and perhaps she will appreciate it more than my family.\n\nLastly, price.  This stuff is expensive.  The Purity Farms I bought at a natural food store and so did not have to pay for shipping, so I decided to see what it sells for on Amazon where shipping is included in the price to more fairly compare pricing and this 4th & Heart grass-fed ghee is about the same price per jar.  Purity Farms is organic but not grass fed, 4th & Heart is grass fed but not organic.  So, this may be why the pricing is so similar.  I can't help but wonder how much more affordable 4th & Heart would be if I were to find it in a store.  At an average of $14 per jar it is quite spendy to use every day as a spread, it is about 2.5 sticks per jar and Kalona Supernatural is about $8 or $9 for 4 sticks, though it is not clarified  just grass-fed and organic.  I would definitely buy this 4th & Heart regularly if I could find it at a store for less than what it sells for on Amazon, and I will still buy it once in a while on Amazon for a treat as both myself and the kids are really loving it, it is really so flavorful as compared to the other ghee I have tried and so much more flavorful than out usual stick butter.  But I think I would choose jars individually so that we get what we like the best and not have to pay for so so flavors.  I can see where this multi-flavor pack would make a totally awesome gift.  And I like how clarified butter has a much longer life span than regular butter, so this stuff doesn't have to be consumed so fast and will last a long while.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTasty Brand Organic Fruit Snacks, Mixed Fruit Flavors, 4 Ounces 5-Count Packages (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese are now our go to for fruit snacks.  Annie's changed their recipe and now contain 11 grams of sutra per serving instead of 10 and they are now sticky which makes for yucky fingers after eating them.  These fruits snacks are the lowest in sugar I can fins that are organic and contain no artificial colors or flairs or preservatives.  As a bonus, not that we need it but one on my daughter's friends is allergic, all Tasty products are produced in nut free facilities.  Very clean, very tasty, as the name says, and the kids love them of course, heck, me too for that matter.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeanut Butter &amp; Co. Chocmeister Hazelnut Spread, Milk Chocolatey, 13 Ounce Jar\nReview:\nI debated the star rating on this, 5 stars would be for taste alone, but despite the reduced sugar and extra protein the nutritionals on this still are not good, so a 4 star was the best I can do.\n\nI love hazelnuts, I love hazelnut butter.  It is actually really hard to find plain hazelnut butter.  When traveling I have found brands like Kettle, Futters, and another brand, the only of these still available is Futters, and no one in the Minneapolis/St Paul area carries it.  So, I had been making my own hazelnut butter using my Vitamix and it was delicious.  I never needed a chocolate hazelnut butter.  My kids and I have all tried Nutella at my mother's house and it is tasty, of course it is, sugar is the first ingredient, and it really tastes just like eating chocolate.  Not my thing, and I am surprised it is my mother's.  I was excited when Justin's came out with a chocolate hazelnut butter, the nutritionals are WAY better than any other chocolate hazelnut product out there, but it is isn't truly chocolate hazelnut because it is almond too, and it is dry and difficult to squeeze out of the little pouches or too dry to scoop out of the cup with the pretzels it comes with, and it just wasn't as tasty as I was hoping.\n\nNow, enter Chocmeister.  They are trying to compete with Nutella as is everyone.  In that vein this has sugar as the first ingredient and has oil added in the form of palm oil.  This being their dark chocolate version does not have any milk added.  Chocmeister says this has 50% more protein than Nutella and 25% less sugar, and this it does indeed.  However, if you really care about the nutritionals you'd choose their milk chocolate version instead because it has 4 grams of protein instead of 3 (Nutella has 2gr protein).  I like that with Chocmeister they use cane sugar instead of beet sugar, cane sugar is not GMO whereas all beet sugar (unless it is organic) is GMO.  I also think it is awesome that they use sunflower lecithin instead of soy as many people are trying to avoid soy for health reasons.  Also, Chocmeister uses natural vanilla instead of the artificial vanillin which has been linked to allergies and ADD like behavior in kids.  Interestingly Chocmeister has also opted to try to boost the fiber content of their product by adding chicory root, and who doesn't need more fiber, right?  I get the feeling that this company is really trying to do things right, or at least better.\n\nThe jar does not say to refrigerate after opening, so I did not, but it was cool (42 degrees) when I pulled it out of the mailbox and yes, I tried it right there in the car, didn't even wait to get home, and was not very spreadable at 42 degrees, but at room temperature is was more than spreadable.  I am looking forward to heating it up in the microwave and trying it as topping on sea salt carmel ice cream :)\n\nSo, on to flavor.  Chocolate is all I taste when I eat this, I don't taste any hazelnut butter.  I am sure there are plenty out there with whom this is fine.  My kids really liked this stuff too, of course, remember, sugar is the first ingredient.  I have to say I have always been a fan of dark chocolate over milk, my kids will tell you they prefer milk, but they didn't complain about this being dark.  If you want something to compare the flavor of this to, it is a lot like the \"cocoa fudge\" they use at Dairy Queen.  I have not tasted Chocmeister's milk chocolate version but I watched a Youtube blind taste test and folks could pick out the Nutella and said that Chocmeister's milk chocolate had more hazelnut flavor and less chocolate flavor in comparison.  So if you are trying to decide between the milk and dark Chocmeister keep that in mind.\n\nWhile I really like the taste of this, I have to say it seemed really rich, and I can't imagine eating two whole tablespoons of this as one serving, I think that is too much.  I think a single tablespoon is way more doable AND it cuts the sugar to 7.5 grams which is within the 9 gram limit we try to keep per serving on foods we buy (not including whole fruits and such).  One tablespoon is plenty for a whole slice of toast or both halves of an English muffin or half a bagel.\n\nNo one is eating this or any other chocolate hazelnut spread for the protein, they eat it for the chocolate, the hazelnut butter is just the spreadable medium the chocolate is suspended in.  So this, like any other chocolate hazelnut spread, is a treat, a dessert.  That being said the reduced sugar (and slightly elevated protein) in this is really a nice thing and makes the guilt factor a lot less.  If you are used to Nutella and love it you may not go for the taste of Chocmeister products, but if you are and you want to move to eating a little better make the switch and you'll get used to the taste of this and be happy.  If you are like me and have never bought Nutella because of how bad for you it is but want a little treat and not to feel that badly about about being bad, then Chocmeister is the way to go.  I can see, since I con't keep sweets in the house, that when those cravings hit I will go to this jar with a spoon and will be satisfied and will not feel as bad about it as other things I could eat, like sneaking my kids' halloween candy....\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCAILLER Pralin&eacute; Chocolate Selection, Large Box Assortment, 7.8 Ounce, (25 Pieces)\nReview:\nI read a lot of the other reviews that said their chocolates arrived melted.  I counted myself quite lucky that mine arrived without melting despite having been shipped from Las Vegas to Minnesota, perhaps my luck has to do with it being the end of October.  While mine did not arrive melted there were still half a dozen pieces that were damaged in some way, sad when this chocolate tries so hard to make a nice and high end presentation with packaging and all.\n\nThis assortment is really quite diverse and I liked that, there were some types in the box I had not ever had before.  There were two of each kind which allowed me to eat one of each and let the rest of the family share the remaining pieces so I was able to make up my mind about these chocolates having tried it all.  The quality of the chocolate was really fabulous, this may have been my first time eating chocolate actually manufactured in Switzerland, it was so creamy, smooth, flavorful, and rich.  My husband and I are much more the dark sort but my daughters are both milk types, they just about died eating their allotment from this box they were in so much chocolate heaven.  I would definitely say that if you are the type to prefer dark then maybe this assortment is not for you.  If you love nuts then this is an amazing assortment.  My favorite nuts are hazelnuts and almonds and I definitely got my fill in this box that's for sure.  Very well done chocolate, very lovely presentation, would make for a real statement gift or a special treat/reward for yourself.\n\nThis is quite pricey, it comes out to about $70 per pound basically.  Anytime I see a product that has free shipping I know I have to remember that the price is inflated to cover the cost of shipping, I cannot help but wonder how much less expensive one might find this box in a store for, and perhaps with less to worry about in terms of damage or melting from shipping.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Chef's Naturals Walnut Halves &amp; Pieces, No Preservatives, Non-GMO, 16 oz\nReview:\nThese are great.  I got them because I like using them in a salad topper recipe (walnuts, chia seeds, almond slices, dried cranberries, dried apple when I have it, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, pecans when I have them).  I also like them in oatmeal and in plain yogurt both with raisins.  I also like adding them to banana bread.  But my favorite recipe for these is cherry chicken pasta.  However, when these arrived, they were opened and sampled and then my daughter sat at the computer just munching on them, so I guess these may not even make into a recipe they are that good.  I like the resealable package, that is a nice change from the nuts in the baking aisle at the grocery store.  I am kind of bothered that they are advertising non-GMO since there are no FDA approved GMO crops other than corn (non-sweet corn), soybeans, sugar beets, canola (rapeseed), and cotton.  So, all walnuts are non-GMO anyway, and since the ingredients are simply walnuts there again would be no need to push these as non-GMO.  I guess I like that Fisher's $ is going to the Non-GMO Project and that they support the labeling of GMO's.  Anyway, good tasty chopped walnuts, not sure about pricing, seems a little high, but then again shipping is included in that, so...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Kodiak Cakes All Natural Frontier Pancake, Flapjack and Waffle Mix, Original, 24 Ounce (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nWe started eating healthier about 9 years ago and a major part of that was eating all 100% whole grains.  Now, these are brownies, so they have a lot of sugar in them, so that does not fit in with our lifestyle as much, but if you are going to be bad a least do it 100% whole grain with excellent taste and texture!  They are so richly chocolate it is amazing, and the chocolate chips don't hurt either!  Honestly you'd never know they are 100% whole grain.  they do take quite a lot of fat, a whole stick of butter plus 2 T oil, but you can substitute.  It is said that for any brownie mix on the market, to make them more healthy you can substitute any/all of the fats/liquids asked for in the instructions except the eggs (so like oil, butter, water) for an equal amount of any of the following: yogurt, apple sauce, pureed black beans.  I have not been brave enough yet to try the black beans, but I did try yogurt and apple sauce, they were fine, there was a bit of taste to each of those but not too much, and of course the texture was a little different without the fat.  We belong to a CSA and get a 3/4 bushel box of fresh local organic veggies/fruit each week during the growing season and one week I had a bundle of baby beet that I did not know what to do with, so I boiled them, peeled them, pureed them, and substituted them in the Big Bear Brownies for the oil, butter, and water,and they were great!  I served them twice when company was over and everyone loved them and asked for seconds, and my girls love them and ask for more and dig the slight pink tint they brownies have.  Next I am going to experiment with pureed summer squash :)  Now I am just waiting for Kodiak Cakes to come up with a recipe for chocolate cake!  No matter what you do, if you want to still be able to eat brownies but want to do it healthier without sacrificing a thing then get these brownies!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nVeggie-Go's Organic Fruit and Veggie Strip with No Added Sugar, Berry, Apple, Spinach, 0.42 Ounce (Pack of 20)\nReview:\nWe have treid all the flavors and this berry spinach is the only one my kids will eat and I like it a lot too, I can eat the other flavors but I don't like like them enough to buy them again.  I'm on my second box from Amazon now but had been buying them at the local grocery store on and off over the past 6 months or so till they raised the price to 1.49 each.  I used them in the kids' cold school lunches and during the summer I used them while travelling to add some vegetables to everyone's diet on days when I know we might be short a little.  I ilke that we get half a serving of fruit and half a servng of vegetables (1/4 cupof each) in each leather, and each one has only 15 calories and 2 grams of sugar and one whole gram of fiber.  The ingredients are great too having only apples, spinach, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and sweet potato, and all organic too.  No fruit juice concentrate here!  No \"natural flavors\" either.  I watched the documentary called Sugar Coated and one of the doctors they featured did a bit where he took a very popular strawberry fruit snack in Canada and put out on a plate one serving then next to that a pile of granulated sugar equal to the grams of sugar in the fruit snack and then next to that a bowl of  1.14 pounds of strawberries which was what one would have to eat to equal the sugar in the fruit snack.  By this method these Mountain Berry Spinach fruit leathers pass the muster equalling about 2 medium strawberries.  Finally something I can feel good about putting into my kids' lunches.  One word of warning though, I have had the misfirtune to end up with some slightly old and hence tough or downright hard Veggie-Go's from the supermarket, guess at their prices they can sit around a little too long.  This has not been an issue with the ones I have gotten on Amazon thankfully.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMott's Unsweetened Applesauce, 3.2 oz pouches, 4 count (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis just arrived today and I had no problem getting the girls to come running to try it.  Both said it was a \"like\" and not a \"love\" so that's why the 4 stars instead of 5.  They are used to GoGo Squeeze Organic and they said they like the Mott's the same as they like the GoGo Squeeze.  We usually buy organic because apples are one of the dirty dozen in terms of pesticides, so for that reason alone I most likely will not buy these but if I am in a store and want apple sauce pouches and they don't have organic ones I would definitely buy these as my second choice, if these came in organic they'd be my first choice GoGo Squeeze in a heartbeat for the following reasons.  I like that these only have 8 grams of sugar per pouch where as the GoGo Squeeze Apple Strawberry has 12 grams of sugar, both are 90 grams.  Where I think these Mott's cut the sugar is that they have added water, these are a bit runnier than the GoGo Squeeze, but not enough that it bothered the kids.  These Mott's have fruit purees, the apple puree is concentrated, but at least it is still a puree (more of the whole fruit intact) and not apple juice concentrate like the GoGo Squeeze which is just a way to add sugar in a way that they can still call them 100% fruit.  The Mott's area also lower carbs, 10 grams as opposed to the 15 of the GoGo Squeeze.  These Mott's are also free from artificial ingredients and bonus they come with Box Tops for Education too.  In summary I really like that Mott's had tried to make the apple sauce pouch healthier than other brands out there and these would be my first choice and my go to if only they were organic.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'sugar', 'one', 'really', 'chocolate', 'kids', 'would', 'much', 'tea', 'eat']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nReese Artichoke Hearts 6-8, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nAt less than a dollar a can, these were a steal!

I've had a lot of balsamic glazes in my long life and this one is the least appealing to me.  My first issue is the vinegar.  When I taste it alone I don't get a balsamic vinegar taste in my mouth.  I just get a harsh plain old vinegar taste that makes my mouth pucker.  I looked at the ingredients and immediately understood why. This is not pure balsamic reduced vinegar.  It's mixed with wine vinegar and that's what I'm tasting.\n\nI tried doctoring this glaze up with honey and it's better but still not what I want.

I was told to stay on a low fiber/no meat diet for a while.  They suggested pasta and rice as a base.  When I saw this I thought...it's Barilla...how bad can it be.  It was pretty darn good with a little drizzle of quality olive oil and parm cheese sprinkled on top.  Now I can eat seafood and right away thought about this with sauteed shrimp and fresh garlic tossed in.  As usual, I checked for the product on Amazon and see they've got a 4 pack available through Subscribe and Save....my favorite way to shop.\n\nI'm looking forward to trying the shrimp dish. While the tortellini is cooking I'll quickly saute fresh shrimp and chopped fresh garlic in a little olive oil and a small pat of butter for rich flavor. Toss that into the cooked pasta and top with a little grated cheese.....yummy!!!!!  Can't wait to add veggies to this dish.  One bag serves 4 or, if you're a robust eater, provides 2 REALLY generous servings.  By the way...leftovers keep well in the frig for days and reheat well if not over cooked so singles or someone cooking for two shouldn't shy away from cooking a whole bag at once.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSimply Organic All-Purpose Seasoning, Certified Organic, 2.08-Ounce Container\nReview:\nI use Simply Organic All-Purpose Seasoning on everything.

I had already started using a lot of Simply Organic spices which I highly recommend.  Thought I'd give this a try too and I'm glad I did.  It's got a rather unique blend of herbs and spices that might sound a little off putting when you read them but they work very well together.  One thing I will note here is that it can be a bit on the spicy side if you add too much.  There are several different types of pepper in this blend that add just the right amount of zip if used properly or to your taste.  I have a sensitive stomach so I don't over due it.  I discovered just how \"zippy\" it can be the last time I made tuna salad.  I had used it in tuna salad the week before and it was fantastic.  I figured if a little was great, more would be fantastic....lol.  Maybe it would be for someone who likes spicy.  Bottom line...buy it...experiment with it starting with smaller amounts at first and add more until you find the amount that gives you the spiciness you want.  Remember it's dried so it takes a little time for the flavors to develop.  When making something like tuna salad, I add it to the mayo first so the dried herbs and spices absorb moisture faster and then mix everything together.  I will definitely be buying this again.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYORK Dark Chocolate Peppermint Candy (Patties), 19.75 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI just looked at a bag of York Peppermint Patties my husband and I were eating.

Alas it doesn't stand up to percolated coffee. I shook it well and added the 2 tablespoons to my coffee. I added more, stirred, more, stirred, more, stirred. I added a third of the 11 oz container and gave up. I still had to add regular half & half to get to a reasonable level of creaminess.\n\nI guess if you like your coffee weak and just a splash of cream it would work. However, it just doesn't stand up to espresso or percolator grinds.\n\nTaste was good (no noticeable aftertaste) but for the calorie load I'll stick with half & half. I can deal with the 40 calories of half & half much better than the higher calorie load it takes to lighten my coffee with Nutpods. I'll just use it on the weekends and maybe in some dinner rolls or baking recipes to use it up.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nStur - Classic Variety Pack, Natural Water Enhancer (5 Bottles, Makes 100 Flavored Waters) - Sugar Free, Zero Calories, Kosher, Keto Friendly Liquid Drink Mix Sweetened with Stevia\nReview:\nI am very happy so far.

I was not sent the exact description of the items as I did not get the Blue and Blackberry one, but a Black Tea with Lemon was subbed instead, so I am deducting a star for that.

It is not a dry granulated product, think paste but scoopable with a spoon. My only dislike was that it was obvious it had a wax seal, because I had to scoop out the broken wax pieces. It doesn't say this in the description, but should. Othewise very tasty.

So I expected to get a honey that was crystallized, and I did. Many people don't understand that crystallized honey in it's raw state is hard. It is not creamy and it is marginally spreadable at best.\n\nI just got it today and already threw about a half a cup that I carved out of the container into a food processor and buzzed it with lemon to make a cough syrup because I'm not feeling well.\n\nAlso the honey does not say in its title it's organic, it just happens to be produced by a company that produces other organic products so that is on the label, not in the title, so I did not expect to get organic honey.\n\nWhat I wanted was raw, solid honey. That is what came in the package. It is not for cooking (although you could cook with it) because you would destroy any healthful benefits of it.\n\nThe bottle was sealed on the outside and the lid was on tight. I did not expect it to be sealed on the inside and it wasn't. After all, there is nothing to spoil inside the package if its real honey. There was nothing to spill. If you get grossed out because there is no inner seal then you probably don't garden either, because to do that you'd have to realize that once in while you eat dirt, and that it's healthy.\n\nI've been eating raw honey for many years now, long before it was fashionable. This is a mild flavor compared to other honeys I've had.\n\nI'm sucking on a nice chunk of it right now\n\nI'm a satisfied customer\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWilton Edible Glitter Silver Stars,  0.4 oz.\nReview:\nVery pretty stars, and I couldn't detect sugar anywhere on the label.

It's OKAY if cooked to softness in something like a strong tomato sauce or a spicy hungarian goulash. When I first opened the bag it did not pass the sniff test - musty smelling. Imagine eating a wet Triscuit cracker that has no salt or sugar or seasonings - that's what it's like if you undercook it. I'd rather purchase a bag of sprouted grain flour and make my own spaghetti noodles - I'm sure it would taste better.  I would not purchase this again and even though I really like noodles I prefer the zucchini noodles. I also like the Jovial brand classic white einkorn pasta but the phytic acid is still an issue with all grains and seeds products that have not been pre-germinated. The ancients knew this. There is a longstanding myth that the human body needs protein to break down into amino acids, whereas the body is perfectly able to create its own protein from amino acids in fresh fruits and vegetables. Nuts, seeds, grains should not need to be more than 10% of diet, and meats amd dairy even less --- I did not start to experience a restored youthfulness until I made ripe fruits and leafy greens 80% of my diet...doctor's orders.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nKing Soba Noodles Organic Sweet Potato and Buckwheat Noodles, 8.8 Ounce\nReview:\nGreat packaging, great product, and I've looked for and tried other sobas... most of them contain wheat as first ingredient.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGarden of Life Raw Organic Protein Unflavored Powder Packets, 10ct Tray - Certified Vegan, Gluten Free, Organic, Non-GMO, Plant Based Sugar Free Shake with Probiotics &amp; Enzymes, 4g BCAAs, 22g Protein\nReview:\nMy body did not jump up and down for joy with this product, and I'm not referring to the taste, smell, or texture.

I've been testing it out, and I used it similar to adding a dollop of sweet yellow miso to a soup or sauce once it is taken off the heat.  Instead of miso I added a dollop of the cashew butter combined with dried herbs to some white sauce (for a pasta dish).  I would do that again.\n\nAnything you wish to add some body and up the fattiness unctiousness, this would be neutral enough, unlike p'nut butter.  If you want to tone down a p'nut butter sauce you could add this, half and half.  I think it has potential to also to enhance a stove-top mac and cheese.  If you spiralize cucumber, this would add some unctiousness - if you don't have an avocado on hand - but would need to be thinned with some lime juice, etcetera; However, I'm not using it as a spread for bread or crackers - it's too bland and needs to be combined with something else to be canape-worthy.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['would', 'great', 'like', 'rice', 'brand', 'salt', 'purchase', 'taste', 'sauce', 'used']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nSincerely Nuts Dried Pineapple Chunks - Two Lb.

The kind that comes with their macaroni and cheese dinners, and used to be available in containers. They vanished from stores years ago, and they used to sell it in small 3 oz shakers by the case here on Amazon, but that too has since disappeared.  Unfortunately grated cheddar is very expensive as compared to the standard Romano or Parmesan.  The Kraft was worth the extra cost for it was so delicious.  But the others I have tried have either been way to expensive, or weak and flavorless.  This Hoosier cheddar blend is not as strong nor as flavorful as the Kraft by any means in my opinion.  But it is still very good, and excellently priced.  Unlike many on here, I don't use it much on popcorn.  I love it on pasta especially, and when making my home made pizzas.  It is also very tasty in soups as well.  It is indeed unfortunate that the Kraft grated cheddar is not available anymore, but this is a very worthy alternative, especially for the price.  Not quite as good as Kraft, but still decent and recommended... : )\n\nPS:  At the time of this writing, the 1 1/2 pound size is a much better bargain over the one pound container.  It's just around $3.00 more and you get another half pound of product.  Also, I was originally sent a one pound container by mistake, but the seller allowed me to keep it and promptly sent me the correct larger size. : )\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBeef Broth Powder, 8 oz.\nReview:\nThis is excellent bullion at a bargain price.  Since its a powder you can much more easily make an accurate measurement of how much you want to add to your stock. And as a powder, it contains slightly less sodium than the familiar cubed bullion. A little of this powder goes a long ways for it is so rich.  So this 8 oz. package ends up being a bargain for it will last most of us through several winters. I highly recommend it.  It has helped me make the best vegetable beef soup in the United States.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nViva Naturals Organic Ghee 8 oz - from 100% Grass-Fed Cows, Non-GMO, and Certified Paleo Diet Friendly\nReview:\nThis stuff doesn't taste exactly like butter, or margarine, but it is close enough that it has a very pleasant, buttery like taste all its own...Though it states that it should be refrigerated after opening, enough reviewers here have taken note that it is not really a requirement....Thus this stuff stays rather soft and spreadable by remaining at room temperature..(But not as soft as butter or margarine that has sat at room temperature for a while). One thing about this stuff that is a nice advantage is its higher boiling point.  Spreading it out in a frying pan sees much less smoke and more substance that butter...A good asset for sure if you really like cooking with this.  Personally with its cost I did not find any real advantage to cooking with it as to taste in the finished product.. If you are really into this being a purer perhaps healthier alternative to butter, that would be a different matter.  But for myself I like it best as a spread for hot rolls, toast, cornbread, etc, all of which it tastes great on.  All in all some really good stuff...A little too costly for me to  use regularly, but a little of it goes a long ways which is a good thing...Recommended for those that are into this sort of thing and really do enjoy the rich taste...\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nChef Boyardee Overstuffed Italian Sausage Ravioli, 15 oz, 12 Pack\nReview:\nThis is undoubtedly the best canned ravioli I have ever tasted. And I am not usually a big fan of canned ravioli except for a quick lunch sort of thing. I just recently came across this variety in the market here and gave it a try.  Not only is the ravioli truly overstuffed, but the sausage they use is very tasty without being hot and spicy.  I have actually baked these with Parmesan cheese and some added garlic and onion for 15 min and had people rave about them being home made.  If you can't find this in your market, its a good deal here on Amazon by the case, and with free shipping.  Excellent home made flavor, and highly recommended... : )\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCheddar Cheese Powder, 1 lb. by Barry Farm\nReview:\nI am admittedly a big fan of Barry Farm products.  They make just about any food, veggie, dairy product, or spice in either a freeze dried or powdered form.  As an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys carrying along a little taste of home into the savage wilderness, this is a company that I am well familiar with.  Not everything they make is delicious, or worth it. My experience with them however is that most of their products are just about the finest, and many times the only ones around.  This cheddar cheese powder is definitely one of their best.  Many reviewers here mention making macaroni and cheese, and popcorn with it.  Although I have used it for those purposes like everyone else, I have also used this powder as an addition to many soups that call for cheese, or grated cheese. (It makes a very flavorful substitute for grated cheese in many recipes.) Hamburger and sausage soups are a good example.  Many times I have concocted delicious one pot meals using this powder while out in the wilds on a hike, or camping. They are remembered as some of the best meals I have ever had. It is also very good when sprinkled on home made pizza, and I have an excellent recipe that includes this powder, butter, flour, and salt, that makes a delicious cheese spread for crackers and super bowl parties. Barry Farms cheddar powder is strong and flavorful, and a little goes a long ways.  A one pound bag will get you through many a recipe and outdoor adventure.  However since the shipping on this is a little high, (and the powder so reasonable) I suggest buying two pounds or more at once and storing it in a good air tight container.  You will save a lot on the shipping, and this powder will last for months if stored correctly.  I highly recommend this cheddar powder for those that enjoy the simple pleasures of popcorn and mac and cheese, as well as the more adventurous among us in the kitchen, and over an open fire...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTomato Flakes, 2 oz.\nReview:\nI have used a pretty good size line of Barry Farms dehydrated veggies for more than a decade now.  Although I occasionally have used them when cooking in my kitchen, the vast majority of time I use them for campfire cooking when I am hiking.  I love carrying dried products such as this on my hikes for they are light, easy to carry, and you can just use what you want and reseal the bag.  (Unlike canned veggies and such that don't take kindly to being bagged and toted along as leftovers).  Best of all, these tomato flakes are very flavorful.  Make that downright delicious.  I add about a third of one bag to any stew or soup I am making on an open fire, and the rich taste of fresh tomato is your reward in every spoonful. A little of these flakes goes a long ways as to flavor, so keep that in mind if your a beginner with them.  They have a much fresher taste than you would imagine, and have been a part of some of the best meals I have ever put together in the wilderness.  My only recommendation when ordering these flakes is to get at least 3 bags at once to make the shipping worth it.  You can order 3 of them for the same shipping cost as one.  Really rich tasting and well worth your money in my opinion...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKirkland Signature California granulated garlic, 18 oz\nReview:\nGarlic powder is like salt and pepper in this house...Never without it and never left out of a recipe...Although I have settled for cheaper brands, quality in the past, this has now become a staple in my home...You can really smell the freshness and strength of this upon opening, and definitely in the taste of whatever I am cooking...This is also superior to the McCormick California garlic which I have had and used before...Fresher and stronger, and even lasts longer...Garlic like any other spice can go bad, lose its pungency over time.  This size jar is just right for how often I use it and its keeping well fresh till the end...And it comes at a very fair price, as well as arrives fast and intact...Really good stuff and recommended...Now, its time to make my home made spaghetti sauce...With garlic...: )\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMargaret Holmes, Tomato, Okra &amp; Corn, 14.5oz Can (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis stuff is available at the local dollar store here.  I picked up a can once just to see what it tasted like and waited quite some time before using it.  Finally one night I decided to heat it up along side a sandwich and was very pleasantly surprised.  It really is delicious and spicy.  It's so good it is one of the very few things I eat that I don't add anything to it, no garlic, salt, nothing.  Since finding it I pick up a couple of cans every time I go to the dollar store and eat it often as a side dish, and sometimes just by itself as a soup. (It's loose in consistency, like a soup). I love it and hope they never stop carrying it at the dollar store.  It's a lot more expensive here but would be worth it if it came to be the only place I could find it.  Try your local dollar store then decide.  Darn tasty stuff...: )\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCelery Leaf and Stalk, 2 oz. by Barry Farm\nReview:\nI have many reviews for Barry Farm products here on Amazon.  Maybe a dozen or so.  If they are not the largest distributor of dried veggies, spices, herbs, etc, than they have to be very close.  I became familiar with Barry Farm products many years ago when I first started doing a lot of hiking.  Their freshness, convenience, and flavor has made them a regular staple carry along on my hikes.  This dehydrated celery stalk and leaf is one that I probably use the most for any camp cooking.  Simply because there is not a soup or stew that I make that doesn't include celery at home. This stalk and leaf product is an excellent alternative to fresh celery that for obvious reasons is not a practical take along on the trail. This product is very flavorful, and a little of it goes a long ways.  I would even  venture to say that in the wilderness, or even at home, this dried celery has even more flavor than fresh any time.  I think it may have something to do with the fact that this is dried from both celery stalks and leafs.  The leaf being something that most of us don't bother with at home.  Every time I have used this in a stew or soup I have easily tasted the celery distinctly in the most delicious of trail concoctions.  As I said before, a little of this goes a long ways. A 2 oz. package gets me easily through three large one pot meals on my hiking trips.\n\nThe only downside to this and all Barry Farm items is the shipping.  This celery goes for around $2.00 a package but costs around $7.00 to ship.  All Barry Farm products are expensive in the shipping sense for a reason I have never really figured out.  But it's very easy to make this and any other Bary Farm purchase easily a bargain by combining either 3 or more bags of this, or anything else from them.  You can actually order 6 of these celery bags for around a dollar more in shipping than the cost for just one.  I routinely order at least a couple of several products at once and end up paying close to the actual price per unit that way.  I highly recommend this very flavorful and convenient celery talk and leaf, as well as combining the shipping on this and or all Barry Farm products.  It will help make you some of the best one pot meals you are to ever enjoy...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDubble Bubble Tub, Original Flavor, 380-Count, 60.3 Oz(3.7 lb)\nReview:\nI decided to buy some Dubble Bubble after seeing a tub of it in the Red Sox dugout on TV.  For some reason I always thought they chewed Bazooka since that was just about all there was growing up as a kid here.  I ran out and got a couple of packs of each for my own taste test.  I gotta admit I like the DB better.  Like the other reviewer here I noticed that its not as sticky on the teeth as Bazooka.  And I actually thought it was sweeter and lasted a tad longer.  Its sorta like comparing Coke to Pepsi for their both good and very similar.  But I do have to give the final nod to DB. (Even considering you still get the Bazooka Joe comic with Bazooka.)

The sweetness tastes natural, not artificial.

Flat and with very little flavor. I am a big coffee drinker, and usually enjoy a strong dark roast doctored with brown sugar and cream. Big rich flavor is what i am looking for. I was concerned when I first opened the bag and realized I couldn't smell it. Brewed a cup anyway, and it still didn't have that rich coffee smell.\n\n It didn't taste bad, and people who like a milder cup would probably enjoy it. Definitely not for you if you enjoy the darker roasts.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nCap Mundo Single-Cup Coffee for Nespresso Brewers, Yrgacheffe, 10 Count (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese are, and seem cheaper than the real thing.\n\nThese don't fit perfectly in my machine.\n\nThe taste is watery, dull, lifeless.\n\nSpend the extra few dollars for the genuine article.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nJava Factory Single Cup Coffee for Keurig K Cup Brewers, Dark and Handsome Dark Roast, 24 Count\nReview:\nSTRONG aroma of chocolate and coconut.  Coffee is definitely the background note with these.  I'm not a fan, but my teens love them.  The cups fit in the standard Keurig type coffee maker.  We  hadn't tried this brand before, so wasn't sure what to expect.  Will have to keep searching for a regular cup and not the flavored variety.  It does smell amazing after brewing a cup.  If you like the sweet flavored coffee store drive through drinks, you will likely love these.  Add milk and your favorite sweetener and you could make this hot or iced.  A definite bargain over that drive through joint!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBalance Bar, Chocolate Caramel Peanut Nougat, 1.41 ounce bars 6 count, Chocolate Caramel Peanut Nougat Nutrition Bar\nReview:\nBalance bars are handy to have on hand when you don't have time for breakfast, or need a substantial snack.  At 190 calories, 6g fiber, and 7g protein they are considerably more nutritious than a candy bar.  Yes, they have quite a bit of sugar.  If you don't look at these as an all the time meal replacement, they are a perfectly fine snack.  The name is 'Balance\" after all.\n\nThe bars come in two pieces.  Chocolate coated with a chewy center that isn't too hard.  Not gritty or waxy tasting, as some of these bars can be.  They will likely melt easily, so not something you want to leave in a hot car or carry in your pocket.  Sturdy enough to toss in a backpack though.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBarley Malt Powder, 1 lb.\nReview:\nBarley malt powder goes great in our homemade \"Ovaltine\" powder.  Its a pricey ingredient compared to the others, but if you like an old fashioned malt, this is what you want.  This is a smooth and very fine powder.  One pound is equal to about a quart.  After I opened the bag, I poured the rest into a quart jar for storage.

But...my kids are all older and perfectly able to munch on an apple or banana and then dispose of the core/peel.

We transfer it to smaller containers that we can heat up for use at the table.

They have helped me to keep my weight down when I do a little cheating on my diet. Before using them I would gain back weight and sometimes add on more than I started with. I just went on a camping trip and took my smoothies along. After eating all sorts of things I shouldn't have, I came home to find I had lost 3 lbs!!

Locally, we can only get the Indian and Elderflower tonics, so when I read about the Mediterranean version, I searched online for it. I knew I would have to pay a premium because of shipping, but was willing to give it a go just for taste test purposes. We use tonic for gin and tonics, no other drinks really, other than little experiments here and there. Needless to say, this is a very good tonic, but not much different from the Indian. So long story short, if it were available locally I would totally purchase it in addition to the other Fever Tree tonics, but since it isn't and it wasn't any better, I won't.

Wow.  So far I have only tried (and intend to try) the Key Lime Pie and the Mint Chocolate Chip but they are both amazing.  They key lime pie is incredibly tart and delicious but unfortunately the flavor only lasts about 10 seconds.  The Mint Chocolate Chip is also incredible and the flavor seems to last much longer (or at least, the dulled post-flavor gum is more appealing).  In any event, even for 5 seconds of flavor these gums are a gem.  Great idea by Wrigley.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I want to be, I just have trouble with the tastelessness of water and thus fall into the trap of guzzling down sodas both for the caffeine and for the taste.  Which is a habit I'd really love to stop.  The problem with most drink additives though is the ingredients.  All those fake sugars and I figure I might as well be drinking a soda.  So then I saw True Lemon at the store and the advertisement that it was 100% natural.  So I thought why not try it?  And I'm glad I did.\n\nI started off with a little box of 10 packets of the Raspberry Lemonade to see how I would like it.  For drink additives it was pricey, but no more (and actually a little less) than if I had bought a case of the same amount of soda.  So I won't complain about the price especially considering this is better for me.  They came in little packets that were long and tubular shaped and easy to get open.  You just pop the top of your water bottle and pour the contents in, getting a little show in the meantime of the powder coming up like smoke from the bottle.  Hey, it doesn't take much to amuse me.\n\nThe taste is pretty good.  I think I taste more of the raspberry and sugar than they do the lemon, and that's why this product doesn't get more than four stars from me.  I would have liked to have had it be a bit more tart instead of just smooth and sweet.  But it's still not bad.  It goes down smooth and one packet is enough to flavor 17oz of water quite strongly.  It also turns the water a nice pale pink color.\n\nAs said before I was strongly attracted to this product because of its ingredients.  Instead of artificial sweeteners, stevia is used.  It also has lemon juice and other natural flavors.  Nothing in the ingredient list looked too bad so I'm happy.  And according to the box its only 5 calories, which isn't too bad either.\n\nDefinitely a product I'd try again, and I'll probably end up trying their other flavors as well.\n\nReview by M.

(Pack of 2)\nReview:\nBefore it was so easy to buy certain organic products in the grocery store, the Spectrum company had all kinds of wonderful fresh oils that I would buy at the health food store. Since that time, certain oils are available in my local grocery. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that they have been around a long time, and always with a focus on high quality and good health.\nCoconut oil has all but replaced my cooking oils, and most of the butter I use. To say nothing of being used on my hair and skin.\n\nIn the years I've been using it, it's become clear that not all coconut oil is the same.\nUnlike a few others, this one has no 'off' scent, it smells fresh and the coconut scent is mild enough to used in a wider variety of cooking applications, as opposed to the highly scented ones that are best in dishes where you want a prominent coconut flavor.\nNon GMO, which I really like.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nViva Naturals Organic Quinoa, 4 LB - 100% Royal Bolivian Whole Grain\nReview:\nAt first quinoa was treated like a flash-in-the-pan 'trendy' fad, but thankfully, it looks like it is here to stay.\nAnd with good reason.\nIf you're reading this, you're already familiar with the health benefits of this ancient grain.

Most protein drinks use very low grade proteins which aren't very healthful so its great to find one which is organic and dairy-free.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSahale Snacks Valdosta Pecans Glazed Mix, 4 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese are so delicious and convenient in these small packages.

I love that they are healthful and taste so great.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWatkins Clear Vanilla Flavor Extract, 11 Ounce (Packaging may vary)\nReview:\nWhen I purchased this, I didn't realize it wasn't 100% pure vanilla. Some of the reviewers post on here that its purposefully made that way to have a longer lasting flavor when used for baked or frozen goods. I'm not sure if thats true or not, but its not nearly as good or strong a vanilla as I'm used to using. Although this Vanilla is inexpensive and looks authentic, its not nearly as good as the 100% vanilla extracts I've used in the past, so, unfortunately, I'll have to go back to the more expensive brands.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nEmerald Cashews, Salt and Pepper, 1.25 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI purchased these at a local store and they were fabulous.

The crispy very light wafer is so delicious. it melts in your mouth along with the white just perfectly sweetened white chocolate. The outer part is good too.

This tea has a very unpleasant taste, something I cannot quite describe.  I have to force myself to drink it until I use up my supply.  It sort of makes me shudder as I swallow it.  I have tried brewing it for shorter times and I still don't like it.  I have also tried the Decaf White Tea, with the same opinion.\n\nIt was surprising to me that I dislike this white tea.

The box contains 4 sachets of 4 kinds: Throat Coat, Echinacea Plus, Breathe Easy and Gypsy Cold Care.  My favorite is the Breathe Easy which really helps to clear up clogged sinuses.

Note that it is recommended to brew these teas for 10 to 15 min.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGood Earth Herbal Tea, Sweet &amp; Spicy, Caffeine Free, 18 Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6) (Packaging May Vary)\nReview:\nI have been drinking Good Earth Decaf Green Tea for many years and it is my favorite tea. This tea is not purely green tea leaves - it also contains lemongrass and other flavors. It is flavorful but mild. Ingredients: Decaffeinated Green Tea, Lemongrass, Natural Flavors (Contains Soy Lecithin), Rose Petals and Peppermint.\n\nBe aware that the Good Earth Decaf Green Tea does not have the more delicate flavor as real Japanese green tea (and not a roasted flavor like Genmai), but it is great as an everyday tea. If you are expecting green tea like in Japanese restaurants, this is not it - if you want that, get high quality loose tea leaves and brew it with the correct temperature water in a teapot. (Although maybe the Good Earth green tea would taste more similar to Japanese green tea if brewed like Japanese green tea should be - read on...)\n\nI often leave my tea bag steeping for a long time (I know, not recommended for green tea, but it likely does extract more of the beneficial antioxidants), up to 30 min, and this tea does not get bitter. It also does not get bitter if the tea sits around before drinking. One Good Earth tea bag works fine for my large 16 oz mug. I have found that other brands of tea can be weak and not flavorful if using only one bag for 16 oz water.\n\nI also like that this tea is decaf since even the smaller amount of caffeine in green tea affects me. Decaf green teas are somewhat hard to find. This company uses a CO2 process for decaffeination, preferable to a solvent extraction process.\n\nNote that this product is available in 18-count and 25-count boxes.\n\nI have tried many other brands of green tea (decaf and regular) over the years and keep coming back to Good Earth brand. Highly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Kashi, Breakfast Cereal, Organic Autumn Wheat, Non-GMO Project Verified, 16.3 oz(Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is one of my favorite cereals that I always try to have on hand.  It is very lightly sweetened throughout (not frosted), has a great taste and good fiber content of 6g per serving.  I tend to avoid any sweetened cereals but I like the light amount of sweetness in this cereal.  I prefer this version over the Kashi Cinnamon Harvest, which was still excellent but a little too \"cinnamony\" for me.\n\nThis Kashi cereal is organic and is a great option compared to the standard brands for shredded wheat and frosted mini wheat cereals.  It tastes better than plain shredded wheat.  It is a healthier option with 7 g sugars compared to 12 g sugars in frosted mini wheats and those contain ingredients I am trying to avoid like high fructose corn syrup and gelatin.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeacock Brown Rice Vermicelli, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI am always looking for healthier, whole grain versions of foods I enjoy.  Unfortunately, these Peacock brand noodles are yet another food masquerading as healthy.  The product title in big letters on the front says \"Brown Rice Vermicelli\", making the consumer think \"this is made with brown rice, so it should be a healthy choice\".  But the first indication that it is not is when looking at the fiber content on the nutrition facts - only 0.6g per 2oz serving.  Then onto the ingredients list to see why so low... contains brown rice, sago starch and water.  The sago starch comes from palms and must not have much (if any) fiber.\n\nThe Annie Chun's Maifun Brown Rice Noodles (sold on Amazon and in my local healthy grocer) has become one of my staples and is my frame of reference when comparing to the Peacock brand.  The Annie Chun's product is made with 100% whole grain, with ingredients brown rice flour and water.  Per 2oz serving, it has 4g fiber and pretty much the same calories and other nutrients as the Peacock brand.\n\nIf you do try this Peacock brand noodles and have not used rice noodles before, you will need to seek guidance elsewhere on preparation.  As others have pointed out, the Peacock package gives almost no directions on how to prepare the product, aside from a brief mention in the recipes (in the header text it does say that they are \"easy-to-cook\" but does not say how).  It also contains a very strange recipe for rice noodles: Aglio Olio style - this is an Italian recipe for noodles with olive oil/garlic/sprinkled with grated cheese that I think would not be very tasty.  The second recipe appears to be for a soup with veggie strips.  Neither recipe gives amounts or much direction.  In comparison, the Annie Chun's package gives clear, specific directions on rice noodle preparation and two recipes.\n\nI use rice noodles = maifun = rice sticks = sometimes called vermicelli for making the Vietnamese salad \"bun tofu\", to serve with stir-fried veggies or in lettuce rolls.  They can also be used in spring rolls/egg rolls.  When cooking with thin rice noodles, be careful not to oversoak/overcook/overmix or they tend to disintegrate.  Asian rice noodle vermicelli (maifun) are not the same as Italian vermicelli and are not readily interchangeable.  If making an Italian recipe, the best results would be expected from Italian pasta and not maifun.\n\nA few final notes...  Both Peacock and Annie Chun's brown rice noodles are gluten free.  The Peacock is made in Singapore and the Annie Chun's in Thailand.  The Peacock noodles do taste fine (kind of bland), but so do the Annie Chun's.  At this time, they are both approximately the same price.  Peacock come in an plastic bag with some noodle crushage upon shipping; Annie Chun's are perfect upon removal from their cellophane bag in a box.  Overall, I highly recommend the Annie Chun's Maifun as a healthier option over the Peacock brand.  On a related note, the Annie Chun's soba and brown rice pad thai noodles are also excellent.\n\nRating for this product: 2.5 stars rounded down to 2 stars.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nGaia Herbs Sleep and Relax Herbal Tea Bags, 16 Count\nReview:\nI am a regular tea/herbal tea drinker and have tried lots of brands and types of tea, including may of the Sleepytime-type before bed teas.  Those tend to be comforting and relaxing but have not made me sleepy.  I was surprised that this Gaia Sleep & Relax tea actually worked to make me sleepy and relaxed within about 15 to 30min.  Thus, I would not drink other than right before bed because it did make me sleepy.  It has a good flavor; I tend to let the teabag steep for a long time and this did not result in bitter or unpleasant flavor.  I assume that letting it steep may result in more of the sleep-inducing herbs to come into the hot water.  The box says to let steep 10min and to drink 1 hour before bed.  This is the second Gaia product I have tried and I have been impressed with the quality.  Although not prominent on the front of the package, this product is certified organic.  Good value for the 20 tea bags.  Definitely recommend.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAnnie Chun's Soba Noodles, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI agree with the 5-star reviews for this product.  These noodles are excellent tasting, have a good texture and cook up very quickly (4 to 5 min in boiling water).  I have not really bought many soba noodles in the past, so I'm not sure how these US-made noodles compare to authentic Asian soba.\n\nIt is easy to saute some veggies and make a quick sauce (or use a purchased sauce), for a weeknight meal.  I often cook the whole box then divide in half, making 1/2 as a hot stir-fry dinner and then save the other 1/2 (plain noodles) to use the next day.  I put the left-over noodles in the microwave for a brief time (just to bring them to room temp) then assemble the salad.  Amazingly, the noodles taste fresh and good the next day, possibly better tasting than freshly cooked.  I'm sure they would make a great noodle soup, although I have not tried yet.\n\nIngredients are unbleached enriched wheat flour, buckwheat flour, water, egg whites, salt.  They seem pretty healthy and have a decent amount of fiber, although they are probably not as healthy as a 100% whole wheat pasta, for example.  For the 12 oz box, 6 servings/box, amounts per serving: 200 cal (10 from fat), 3g fiber, 390mg sodium, 8g protein, 10% iron.  Also, great price from Amazon.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHiggins &amp; Burke, Green Tea, 20 Count (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI drink a lot of tea, but not mint very often.  Mint tea is thought to be relaxing and calming, and I did find this to be such.  I generally think of all mint teas to be the same, since they usually contain only one ingredient, mint of some sort, although of varying \"dustiness\".\n\nThis Higgins & Burke peppermint tea exceeded my expectations.  It has great flavor and is very minty/mentholy (invigorating and refreshing, as well as soothing).  This reflects on the high quality peppermint used.  The individual teabag packaging also keeps the product fresh, so it will taste great even if it has been in the cupboard awhile.  I did need to be careful not to overbrew it.  While this peppermint tea will not replace my daily tea selection, it is a nice change.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Erewhon Raisin Bran, Organic, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis is a great organic cereal.  I love that each individual flake comes from one wheat berry that is steamed then squished - no overprocessed flakes mixed with sugar as mass market raisin bran cereals.  This does mean that the Erewhon flakes are small, as a few reviewers already mentioned.  I really like the texture of this cereal.  It tastes great with a blend of vanilla soymilk and cow's milk to provide a bit of sweetness (since the cereal itself does not contain sugar).  I do let it sit after adding milk, to soften a bit before eating.  It could use a few more raisins, but that is not a big enough deal to downgrade my rating.  Another consideration is that this is not a fortified/enriched cereal, so it is different from the typical cereals that provide a bunch of added vitamins.  It does fill you up (6g fiber per serving) and helps to reduce between meal junk food cravings.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCarmelina Brands Italian Bianchi De Spagna Beans (Butter Beans), 14.28-Ounce Units (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nLOVE!  These beans are delicious, high quality, creamy, XL size.  Their large size also makes them seem fun to eat and a novelty.  The ingredients list is short, only beans and water.  Since they have no added salt, a fair amount of salt/seasoning is required.  The beans are somewhat fragile, so mix gently and if using in soups, add at the end of cooking.\n\nOne of my favorite quick dinners is to drain and rinse these butter beans, heat up in the microwave (can also add chopped onion or bell peppers), drizzle with a good evoo, S&P & maybe fresh chopped herbs and top with homemade whole wheat breadcrumbs (made with butter/evoo, garlic salt, herbs; or Italian seasoned panko would work too; or the crumbs left in the bottom of a croutons or stuffing mix package).\n\nI have been very satisfied with all varieties of Carmelina / Mangia beans I have tried.  Great, healthy product to use when you don't have time to soak and cook your own dried beans from scratch.  Product is imported from Italy.\n\nAs others, I have also experienced some dented cans that I use up first (nothing so damaged that it was unusable).  I have ordered beans a number of times over the last few years and always have this issue - since Amazon has not corrected by now, I am not hopeful this will be resolved.\n\nUpdate 5/15/2015: on my latest order, the cans were delivered in perfect condition, no dents!  The packaging has changed to a cardboard box having inner cardboard dividers between cans.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['tea', 'good', 'also', 'like', 'product', 'great', 'tuna', 'beans', 'noodles', 'green']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nKIND Healthy Grains Clusters, Vanilla Blueberry with Flax Seeds Granola, 10g Protein, Gluten Free, Non GMO, 11 Ounce Bags, 3 Count\nReview:\nWe've been gluten free for several years now, and one of the things that has been missing is a good, crunchy, gluten-free granola.\n\nThe Vanilla Blueberry granola boasts a punch of delicious vanilla flavor and crunchy oat clusters. It's packed with a variety of healthy grains in addition to the gluten free oats.  It's a healthier granola.  The only downfall is the lack of blueberries in the granola. When a granola is labeled vanilla blueberry clusters, I tend to look for blueberries or at least a noticeable blueberry flavor. (The lack of blueberry is the reason for the 4 star instead of 5 star review.)\n\nThe Cinnamon granola had a very nice cinnamon flavor. The granola tasted great with milk as well as eating plain as a snack.\n\nIt would be nice if the granola came in larger packages as we went through the granola very quickly. If you use it on top of yogurt or ice cream, it will last much longer.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

This is the best product out there in powder form for authentic Chinese cooking and chicken flavor.  . .beats any other brand on the market! I use it constantly instead of chicken cubes in my basic cooking. It can be a little salty but the flavor beats all the other brands.....so when your almost done cooking then taste your food then add salt!.  This product certainly should not be used for someone on a low sodium diet! I have been using it for my homemade egg drop soup. I add a few tablespoons of Korrs chicken broth mix to a quart of water and add few teaspoons of  soy sauce, maybe a dash of ginger and a dice scallion, then I add last the scrambled egg mixture to the hot broth and it taste like real authentic egg drop soup from Chinese take out! Also made cream of chicken and wild rice soup which was awesome! If you do not like using the powder form I also use \"Better than Bouillon Chicken Base Organic\" which once opened need to be refrigerated but the taste is superb but more expensive!\n\n****************************************************************************************\n\nUpdate one year later. .. . .OMG, this stuff is the bomb! So addicting  because of the outstanding flavor. I have been sauting vegetables (actually any vegetable will work) and sprinkling a half teaspoon of this and it brings out the best flavor. I then throw a splash of cooking sherry..  . .yummy! I cannot say enough great things about the flavor. Every week I find a new reason to use this. I go through this like crazy! So happy I can get the large size (2LB) on Amazon.

I've heard of it but have never given it any thought until now. What I didn't understand is that though it's butter, it is clarified butter and therefore has a higher smoke point than just regular butter. This has the same great taste as butter, even richer I think, but is good for high temperature cooking. I used it tonight on my  oven-baked fresh cut fries and it worked wonderfully and made the best tasting fries I've ever had. I think this will be a product in my kitchen from now on.

Packed full of natural and healthy ingredients, it's more than just a snack, it can be a meal. I like to have these around when I'm busy working and don't have time to stop for lunch, this is a great alternative to cooking something when time is short. At 230 calories (for the cherrylicious) it will give me the energy that I need to get through the afternoon and will fill me up without busting my calorie goal for the day.\nI am always looking for natural foods that I can feel good about feeding my family. The ingredients  in these bars are all names that I can pronounce and that I recognize, many of which are in my own cupboard. I also believe the fewer ingredients, the better for you.\nThe price is similar to high-end bars that I see on my weekly grocery trip.\nThese pass every standard that I have for pre-made food and I recommend them highly. If you travel a lot and need healthy food to eat on-the-go then I recommend these.

We love that the only thing we need to add is water (making these perfect for people who love to camp, not me, but some people like to do that...) because sometimes I just don't have eggs, oil, or milk.

It comes well-sealed in shrink-wrapped plastic. The flavor is excellent. Be warned to make the slices as thin as possible, because there is an after bite of pepper (it is pepperoni, after all) that lingers.

I used two (2) tablespoons as the exclusive seasonings in two quarts of ingredients that included home-canned plain tomato sauce, 1.3 pounds of ground round, a can of thoroughly rinsed mild chili beans, and 1/2 cup each of chopped onion, green pepper, and celery.  The addition of the Chili Base took the pot from bland ground beef soup to bright-colored tasty chili that I will be proud to serve to anyone.  This is well worth the investment.  Please note that the suggestions on the jar said use 4 (four) tablespoons of Chili Base in about that amount of chili--half that amount is plenty for my taste, besides making it more cost effective.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Natural Products Herbs, Og, Spice Blend, 5-Ounce\nReview:\nThis is a bit hotter blend than I expected, but overall a good mix to add pizzazz to any non-sweet cooking project.

So I'm lovin' these pre-mixed offerings of spices from various places in the world. As I am fond of Mediterranean cuisine, this mixture from Tunisia with its peppery bite hits my palate just right. I only had to correct the salt. You can just sprinkle it or make a paste with water or olive oil for a rub.\n\nIt tastes very fresh and of course had a good seal when it arrived. It has already been assigned a place in the refrigerator in order to keep it fresh as long as possible. Well, not sure its life expectancy is ALL that long cuz it tastes really good!\n\nThe label says it contains organic paprika, organic caraway, organic crushed red chili pepper, organic cayenne, organic coriander, organic cumin, organic garlic, organic peppermint and sea salt.

There are three things I particularly like which are that it is gluten free, the vegetables do not overwhelm the rest of the ingredients and the stock is in fact particularly savory.\n\nI've never quite gotten over an ad campaign Progresso mounted in which they mocked and targeted their competitor, Campbell soups. It seemed to be the work of the worst kind of bully. I spoke to both companies about it.

I wouldn't buy any more of them. But these pods are fabulous.\n\nI got these nearly two years ago for my Senseo pod coffeemaker that lasted for all of 30 uses. Junk, crap. But these pods have proved the opposite. They have outstanding flavor, even when they ought to be stale. Usually I have brewed coffee but when I run out and it doesn't make sense to make another pot, I put fresh water in a cup, add one of these and heat it in the microwave. Presto! A cup of java to which I add my 1% milk and enjoy. I am simply amazed that I can get such a good cuppa from a non-refrigerated, long-opened package, coffee pod!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSenseo Dark Roast Coffee Pods, 4.41 Ounce, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI have been most impressed with both my super-fast Senseo single-serve and its coffee pods. But no, the coffee does not taste as good as that I freshly grind. I realize that is an option if I want to produce my own pods but that would defeat the undeniable convenience of the single-serve machine. The coffee produced by this pod arrangement is happily strong - with this Dark Roast; I haven't yet tried any others - and the crema is wonderful, over and over. I do pre-wet the pods before brewing. I guess I could also wet down the machine parts. And I do heat non-fat or 1% milk in the microwave, then brew directly into that cup. This procedure mixes moo and joe quite adequately.\n\nThere is some aspect to the taste of the brew that does not please me - not sure I can put it into words well. I think it is partly due to the inevitable not-entirely-freshness of the pods. In addition there is some kind of harshness that seems intended to masquerade as richness. Duh? Maybe someone more knowledgeable about coffee prep can identify it better. I do not see anywhere on the package that these coffee pods are 100% Arabica. Could that be it? But for the convenience and cost, I cannot complain TOO much. I am really happy with the purchases.\n\nWant to say a word of thanks to other reviewers who have made helpful suggestions and observations. Here's one I've found through experimentation: There is still strength left in the pod after one brewing. I've started re-using them. The method depends upon my coffee needs at the moment. Sometimes I install the 2-cup holder in the machine and re-use one with a new one. Then I end up with two used ones, and darned if they don't have another use in them. Maybe you won't like this but it is an option to try if you wish. (By comparison, I've found there is absolutely no value in the used grounds after I've brewed a pot of drip.) By the way, the used pods still produce a fine crema; whether this is due to the pods or the well-designed machine I do not know.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nFire Cider, Apple Cider Vinegar Tonic with Honey, Original Flavor, Natural Detox, Pure &amp; Raw, Certified Organic Ingredients, Ideal for Cleansing Diet, No Heat Processed, 16 Shots, 8 oz.\nReview:\nIn order to obtain a trademark for Fire Cider, these people had to pretend that it was not already in common usage. All you have to do to discover that it has been used and shared for years, particularly by herbalist leader Rosemary Gladstar - and specifically called Fire Cider - is to Google it. Please do. Even if by some weird coincidence, they HAD happened to come up with both a strikingly similar formula and exact name, they could only obtain a trademark (which they have!) via false search results. Even if it weren't illegal, this is such a betrayal of trust, such a dishonorable act, that these Shire City \"business\" people deserve zero respect. The obvious lack of morals in claiming to have originated this, calls into question their credibility in every other aspect. Do they think they can corner the market by legally preventing anyone else from making for sale, a recipe that was developed by someone else before they were born? They seem to claim they won't do that, but as I said, they have already destroyed their credibility.\n\nHere's their less-than-honorable attempted enforcement of this shabbily-obtained trademark. After claiming on an Internet site that their trademark was needed to protect the product from the large food corporations, they stated that they had no intention of keeping others from using fire cider as they had been prior to the trademark. On their Wordpress blog, they state, \"We are not interested in suing anyone, especially herbalists working outside of the commercial marketplace.\" Right. Forcing others to discontinue selling long-held products via a well-known auction site is not the same as bringing a lawsuit. Go find them. Their blog is entitled \"firecider\" and as I said, it is at Wordpress. (Also search Fire Cider for their Facebook page.) You'll find their blog explanation cleverly worded but if you know the turf, very slippery. What happened, according to herbalist friends, is that they then proceeded to cause Etsy, the artsy Internet auction site, to stop other retailers from offering fire cider there. Do you need any more proof?\n\nBefore I knew of the problem these people have created, I bought some of the product locally and it was so-so - a friend a few blocks away makes some that is far better. Thing is, if people will claim ownership of a commonly-held recipe and name for profit, in what way will they alter their products for more profit?\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nFini Balsamic Glaze, 8.45 Ounce Bottles\nReview:\nLuckily found this at the supermarket but not a great deal cheaper. I enjoy balsamic vinegar and also the art of cooking, so a product that is condensed balsamic vinegar was something I just had to try. Naturally, I had to research it first. Turns out a lot of brands add a lot of extra ingredients; that I didn't want. This has just \"Balsamic vinegar of Modena ('aceto balsamico di Modena I.G.P.') 90%, (concentrated cooked grape must, wine vinegar, caramel color), glucose syrup, modified corn starch. Yes, it is sweeter than just plain balsamic. It makes such an elegant dollop, say on roasted pork with which it pairs well.\n\nIn addition to having a wonderful taste, I like the way the container is designed. It will stand up on either end, taking up less room in the fridge and promising utility when I have to get that last remaining amount to the business end. Speaking of the business end, I am delighted to find an unusually well-designed dispenser which allows me to put a dollop or smear exactly where I want it and when done, there is no mess. I mean the outside of the dispenser is totally clean after dispensing.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTrue Orange Shaker, Ginger, 2.82 Ounce\nReview:\nAnother great flavor burst from True Citrus Co, made in the USA and containing only crystallized orange [citric acid, orange oil, orange juice], ginger, maltodextrin, natural flavor. Contains soy. No preservatives. Gluten free. I keep it in the refrigerator and use it to instantly transport my simple meals to International Flavor City.\n\nThe orange flavor is very definite. The ginger is less so but its tart tang adds to the orange. I am accustomed to buying gingerroot and paring and mincing just before consumption; it is unlikely a dried version can replicatehat flavor. At any rate, I am more than happy with these products, their convenience and purity.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nThai Kitchen Coconut Milk, 13.66 fl oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nLuckily this is available locally so I got to try it without ordering a whole case. I find it absolutely delicious. So far it got used to make a black rice with dried cranberry dish, very simple. Tomorrow a pumpkin curry soup, then I think a chicken curry the next day. I'm looking into making my own coconut milk so I don't have to worry about using a whole can before it goes bad, but meanwhile I am delighted with this brand in both taste and consistency.\n\nAND let me not forget to praise the manufacturer for resisting the temptation to add those poisons people think are preservatives (particularly sodium metabisulfite). I'd rather there were no guar gum, frankly, but was unable to find any without that at local supermarkets.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSplenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with B Vitamins, Net Wt 2.8-Ounces (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nSplenda is Splenda. That's easy. It works to create an illusion of sweetness. It can be most helpful if staying away from regular sugar is necessary. I was thin, too thin, for many years but gradually that changed. I still didn't have to count calories, just stay away from ingesting too much or too fatty food, but even that changed. Now I am analyzing my intake to eliminate the empty calories of cane sugar, corn syrup and the ilk, even the fructose of 100% fruit juices in favor of consuming the whole fruit.\n\nWhat's not easy is choosing whether to use an artificial sweetener. First of all, some people mistrust them, suspect them of being carcinogens etc. and ask whether the cure might be worse than the disease. Some of the other artificial sweeteners, which shall remain nameless, might bear investigation.\n\nBut Splenda, which has only been available in the US for a dozen years, is sucralose plus dextrose and/or maltodextrin. Sucralose is actually derived from sugar but has no calories. The fillers add calories but not nearly as many as sugar. In addition, Splenda is heat-stable to 450F and does not add an artificial flavor to baked goods. However it is questionable whether the vitamins survive the heat of cooking.\n\nI find Splenda especially helpful in making desserts sugar-free when necessary, everything from puddings to pies to betties. This Splenda claims no calories, as do their other varieties. The actual caloric content of a single-serving, 1-gram packet [which is the size of the packet reviewed here] is 3.36 calories, which is less than a third of the calories of a single-serving, 2.8-gram packet of granulated sugar. FDA regulations allow foods to be labelled zero calories, \"if the food contains less than 5 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving\". So that gets just a mite tricky. Regardless of FDA regs, I feel it is questionable to emblazon the packaging with a claim of \"No Calorie Sweetener\" when it actually does have them.\n\nAnother packaging issue is the description \"Net Wt 2.8-Ounces (Pack of 4)\". That made me think I would receive four packages of 0.7 oz. each which I could use in baking. But in fact there are 80 tiny foil packages suitable for use in individual cups of whatever, and the box states \"Each packet sweetens like 2 teaspoons of sugar.\" No problem; you just need to be aware of what you will be getting as this stuff is really expensive.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCommunity Coffee Whole Bean Coffee, French Roast, (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nFirst impressions: None of the three bags received were vacuum-packed in the manner that withdraws air from bag and leaves the bag material tightly air-free and clinging to the bean bodies. However the expiration date of the packages is 12/22/13, giving plenty of time for consumption. Upon opening, I found the beans to have a fresh aroma and the consistent dark oily appearance expected of a dark roast.\n\nPrep: I carefully cleaned my Mr. Coffee burr grinder whose grind adjustment is 1/3 of the way into the fine grind setting. I shook out as many of the old beans as possible, then ran fresh beans from this bag through and dumped the results, brushing out all visible debris, hoping for no contamination. Then and only then I ground for this pot.\n\nBrew: Made a full 12-cup pot in a long-used, familiar Gevalia automatic drip machine. Carafe cleaned regularly with baking soda and well rinsed. Water allowed to run prior to filling machine in order to clear stale water from pipes.\n\nCuppa Joe style: Used my preferred method of 1/2 cup skim milk heated in microwave, topped off with 1/3 cup freshly brewed coffee. No sweetener.\n\nAnalysis: Right off I was hit with floral, winey notes. I felt smoothness with strength. Then the intensity of traditional dark roast broke in a very pleasant way. The smoky intensity lingered as an aftertaste, also pleasant and satisfying. Suddenly the fog left and I was delightfully wide awake so there is plenty of caffeine which is, for me, a requirement.\n\nRecommendation: Outstanding price/value.

You'll be making raspberry kool aid with a tiny bit of tea flavoring.\n\nI won't be buying it again, that is a big fer-shure.\n\nLipton - you can do SO much better - why don't you try it?\nYou already know how to do tea - now you need to work on flavorings and sweeteners.\nHere's a news flash - most of us do NOT want aspartame in our drinks any more.\nPLEASE change over to stevia, which does not cause the side effects or raise blood glucose levels.\nListen to the customers...\n\nMeanwhile, pass on this one!  : P\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nLaffy Taffy Rope, Strawberry, 0.81 Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nThese are so good!\nThe product we received as very fresh and tasty.  Every rope was a big mangled, like they'd been shoved in the package by ogres, but they were not popped open and were safe to eat.\n\nLaffy Taffy, for those who have not had it before, is a very soft, chewable taffy, not at all sticky.\nWe love all the Laffy Taffy flavors except grape, but strawberry is a big favorite.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSunsweet Prune Pitted Ones, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 10)\nReview:\nI absolutely love these!\nEach canister is filled with individually wrapped prunes.\n\nI am the only one in our house who eats these.  I've tried buying the bags,\nand buying another type of canister, but they always get dried out before I\ncan finish them all.  This is just right - allows me to eat them when I want to,\nand I always get a fresh product.\n\nWhile they could do better on the cost in my opinion, I have not had a bad one\nfrom this canister from Sunsweet yet. Is it the best value for your money?\nDepends on how you look at it - it costs more per prune, but in my case, I have a lot\nless waste. So, it is a flip of the coin.\n\nThe fruit, however, is fresh, soft and tasty. Don't let an \"old person\" image of prunes\nkeep you from trying this yummy fruit!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFiber One 90 Calorie Soft-Baked Bar, Lemon Bar, 12 Fiber Bars, 10.6 oz (Value Pack)\nReview:\nI was skepticle about these bars being very good.  I mean, I know Barry from the commercials loves the Fiber One bars, but what about those of us to had to actually buy them, and weren't paid to eat them?\n\nWell, turns out that these are VERY good. They are also VERY small.  Apparently, Fiber One made the portion size with keeping under 100 calories in mind.  I was seriously surprised at the tiny size. But, you have to keep your focus on the fiber so you don't kick yourself for such a tiny bar. They do have a lot of sugars in them, mainly from the lemon flavored frosting squiggles. Not sure if they had to add so much sweetness to cover the taste of the inulin (chickory root), the fiber they use or what, but at this point, I don't mind.  Thanks to dental troubles, I can't chew as well as I used to, so getting fiber is a challenge. (Sorry, I just can't down a glass of Benefiber, even though I know it isn't supposed to be gritty! I know it's in there!)  These bars seem to be doing the job I hired them to do, and taste goodwhile doing it.\n\nWell done Fiber One.  This is one I'll be a repeat buyer for.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDaVinci Gourmet Syrup, Zero Calorie Caramel, 12.7 Ounce\nReview:\nWe have a recently-diagnosed diabetic in our house, so have been purging the house of all things sugary\nand trying out replacements that do not have aspartame in them.\n\nWe have several flavors of the sugar-free syrups.\nThis one tastes like pancake syrup.\nNot unpleasant, but I wouldn't call it caramel either!\nVery thin and watery, and definitely leaves the pancake syrup flavor behind in your mouth.\nOk maybe for super sweet coffee drinks.\n\nI don't think I'd buy it again.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nArizona Lemon Iced Tea Stix Sugar Free, 10 Count Per Box (Pack of 6), Low Calorie Single Serving Drink Powder Packets, Just Add Water for a Deliciously Refreshing Iced Tea Beverage\nReview:\nMy son loves Arizona tea, and these packets make it easy to have tea instead of water.\nHe tosses a few sticks into his backpack or pocket and can easily have tea whereever he can get a bottle of water.\nThey are a little overpriced for what you get, so watch for a sale price, but he's happy with them.\n\nIt's odd that they can advertise \"no artificial flavors\" when they use SUCRALOSE as their sweetener though.\nThey aren't truly sugar free, and the fructose in sucralose can really mess with your blood sugar, so be aware if you have\nproblems that way. It'll also add to your waistline if you drink too many of them.\nBe aware that you are drinking that mess every time you have them. That lost them a star for my review.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLundberg Family Farms Wild Blend Rice, 16 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nFirst off, we all love rice at our house. I also love wild rice and rice pilaf,\nalthough the others are not all that big on those dishes.\n\nSo, when I read the descriptions on this, I thought it sounded really tasty, but\nhad some real hesitations about buying six packs of the rice. I wondered how we'd actually\nmanage to use six bags before it went bad.\n\nWell, the bags are not all that huge. Each bag is one pound of rice. I guess I had a hard\ntime visualizing it, but the bags are fairly small. I don't have one in front of me, but they\nare maybe 6\" square.\n\nAnyway, we made the first bag this weekend, putting it in a crock pot and letting it cook\non low for 2 or 3 hours. Hubby is the chef in our house, and he used beef broth with the rice.\nWe had it with some sausage for dinner. Let me say - WOW!\nThis is really tasty rice! Between the four of us, we managed to wipe out the entire pound\nof rice (yes, it was that good!), and were figuring out what the next meal with the rice would be!\n\nWatch your prices on this - they vary widely, even across Amazon. But, as long as it stays in the price\nrange on this listing, then we'll be buying it again. Seriously, this stuff tastes great! It was\ntasty, filling and actually easier to chew than I thought it might be (I have troubles with crunchy foods).\n\nThank you Lundberg for a really great blend of rice.  You've converted us!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBUMBLE BEE Premium Skinless and Boneless Wild Pink Salmon, Ready to Eat Salmon Pouch, High Protein Food, Keto, Gluten Free, High Protein Snack, Canned Food, Bulk Salmon, 5 Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI love these packets!  No can openers needed, no draining needed.\nI have not tried the tuna packet yet, but I've had BB in a can, so I am sure these are just as good.\n\nThe product arrived quickly. What I most wanted to know was the fresh until date.\nWe ordered in June 2014, and received product with a fresh \"use by\" date of July 2017.\nSince I am buying this partially for \"prepping\", I was happy with the date.\n\nWould buy again.\n\nUPDATE:\nI've now eaten this tuna three times. It is great! I was concerned that it might be dry and yuck,\nmuch like Walmart's tuna packets. Nope... these are very moist and have great flavor.\nThe packets are very easy to open as well.  I often just squeeze some mayo right into the packet\nand stir it up and scarf it.\n\nInteresting note to me... we have two cats, neither of which likes seafood or tuna flavored cat food.\nBut when I opened the Bumble Bee packet, our boy cat about climbed up on my shoulder to check it out!\nVery unusual for him, but I take it as a sign that this is a much better tuna than the WM brand I've been buying. I let him lick the inner packet (which I cut completely open), and he was eating chunks of tuna right out of my hand.  So, this is a better tuna, according to both my fork and my cat! ;-)\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'one', 'tea', 'well', 'good', 'flavor', 'taste', 'little', 'really', 'great']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nGhirardelli Premium Hot Beverage Mix, White Mocha, 19-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is nothing but sugar.

I left home, and did not really bother to make beans for years and years, then one day I experienced an incredible urge for a pot of Pinto Beans. I bought some at the grocery store, but they were tiny, not the right color, and their taste was dull, without any of the rich gravy that I had come to expect from every batch of Pinto Beans that I had ever had in my life.\n\nSo, I turned to good old Amazon, certain that Ammy would have more Pinto Beans than even the most ardent lover of beans could ever imagine. I was right, it took me an hour to go through all of the various Pinto Beans on offer, and I had to make a few tough decisions.. In the end, I opted for Bob's Red Mill Pinto Beans. While they are not organic ( my preference), they are non-GMO, and are thick, plump, lightly-speckled beans, just the type that I grew up with.\n\nI ordered a big , old- fashioned Southern ham from a smokehouse in the Deep South, boned it out, cut up the bones, chopped about a quart of the ham into cubes, and was ready to go. First, I washed the beans and soaked them overnight in cold water, in a pan covered with a cloth, at room temperature. The next day, I drained the old water and added enough fresh water to cover about 2 inches above the beans, I added about four pieces of ham bone, four cups of cubed ham, two chopped bell peppers, 1 chopped onion, 2 bay keaves, a tea strainer full of about one tablespoon of whole black peppercorns, and two cans of original flavor Rotel Sauce. I brought this mixture to a boil, turned the beans way down low to simmer, and left them, barely bubbling, on the stove for about 5 hours. I stirred them infrequently, just to make sure that they weren't 'sticking on the. bottom of the pan.\n\nI made a batch of long- grain brown rice in my rice maker, and we each had a soup bowl filled with rice, and topped by these luscious , flavorful, and delicious beans with a thick rich gravy. They were so good that even my Yankee husband went back for seconds. These pinto beans are the best that I have ever eaten. They were a whole new taste experience for me, each bean was plump, juicy, and full of its own rich flavor, not to mention the flavor of the ham which had permeated the entire pot of beans with its own hickory-smoked flavor.\n\nThese are without a doubt the best Pinto Beans that I have ever tasted. They were clean, pale cream in color with the classic pinto dark markings. They had a very sweet taste, which was clean and pure, and they  soaked-up the ham and other seasonings as well. These beans are really expensive, my Southern ancestors must be turning in their graves over the price that  I paid ! However, I do not eat them every day, and they are the only beans that I have ever found that taste as good as the  beans that I grew-up with. You can serve them over brown rice, or you can make a nice batch of cornbread made with stone-ground corn meal and buttermilk., and use that to sop-up the yummy gravy.. Again - these beans are so expensive, but they are the only beans that I have ever found that taste like the beans from my childhood.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Extra Thick Rolled Oats, 32 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI live on Smoothies. One of the many, many ingredients is oats. I like thick,hunky, seriously \"Oatey\" oats.these fill the bill. Like all \"Bob's Red Mill organic\" items, the quality is just superb.\n\nThe have a fresh, rich, oat fragrance, and are the trickiest cut that I have been able to find. I have 26!noz. smoothie cups. These are serious Smoothies that I am making, and I live on them. I add 1/4 cup oats to each cup (approx), along with about 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon to bring out, and accentuate the flavor.. I put them in the cup, and mix them into the Smoothie,not wanting to run them through the blender, and  totally defeating the purpose of my lovely fby chopping them up all tiny again.\n\nThey are about as pure and additive-free as can be found. The flavor and quality is just like candy to me ( I lack a sweet-tooth.), and really read and consider the nutritional level of this oat, I should be blasting off to the  moon some day,  under my own steam some day soon.\n\nI highly recommend these. I double bag themin Zip-Loxks, and freeze them. They stay nice and fresh, and their vitamins and nutrients are unaffected by the heat of a warm kitchen. If you can, try these. The nutrition that is added to your system, plus the luscious taste, makes these oats worth the effort.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill, Organic Medium Grind Cornmeal, 24 oz\nReview:\nI grew up eating cornbread, not the kind made with finely ground meal, white flour, sugar, and other non-Southern affectations. No, my family made the real thing : Stone Ground Coarse Yellow Corn Meal ( Personally fetched from the mill.), buttermilk, eggs, baking soda, salt, and bacon drippings. A large cast iron skillet was heated in the oven, with a spoonful of bacons drippings, until smoking hot, then the batter was poured into the pan. The pan was so hot, that the bottom and sides of the batter immediately fried and climbed the sides of the pan. This pan by the way, was a sacred object in our kitchen, it was never to be washed with soap and water, never scrubbed, and only Mother was allowed to use it. When the cornbread was baked, she would grab the hot pads and flip the heavy, cast iron pan over onto a plate. The cornbread came sliding smoothly put of the pan, exhibiting a golden, crispy, and yummy crust. Mother then wiped the hot pan out with a paper towel, and left it on the stove to cool down, that was it. Generations of Southern women seasoned these precious pans and passed them down to a lucky daughter.\n\nThe corn bread was yummy, tart and rich from the buttermilk, crispy on the outside, smelling of bacon, and crumbly and speckle-colored on the inside. This freshly ground corn meal was not solid yellow, it had various colors of specks in it, including black specks. Since it had just been ground, this was not mold or dirt, that was just what stone-ground corn meal looked like. I grew-up, left home, and forgot about cornbread for many years. But then the urge for it returned, I purchased my own cast-iron skillet and began a search for corn meal. I could not find any coarsely ground, stone ground corn meal that even remotely resembled what I grew up with until I tried this meal from Bob's. What a relief, the grind is just right, the meal is coarse and full of  differently colored specks, just exactly like what I grew up with. The corn bread that I produced was perfect, just as Mother would have made it. This meal is really expensive, my female Southern ancestors must be turning in their graves over what I paid for this. But......it is authentic, and just exactly what was needed to produce a real old-fashioned Southern cornbread.\n\n* Always store this in the freezer, it will go rancid very quickly otherwise.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBaja Bob's Maui Madness Mai Tai Mix, Sugar Free, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI ordered a case of this product, not expecting much in the way of taste, but at least it would be a low- calorie way to enjoy a Margarita. Amazingly enough  - this is an excellent mixer,  it tastes as if it has been made with fresh limes, and the artificial sweetener does not give the mix an odd taste. I just followed the instructions on the bottle, 3 parts mix to one part of Tequila. I added nothing additional, and served the drink with crushed ice. It has a light and refreshing taste, a recommended way to enjoy a nice Margarita, without an overload of calories.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCarr's Whole Wheat Crackers, 7-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese are the most lovely biscuits that I have had to good fortune to discover -  rich and whole-wheat flavored, and that extra \" Highlands Butter taste. These have a womderfully fine crumb, the aroma wafting from these must be eaten, or enjoyed, with a fine Cappuccino..\n\nThey have a lovely golden  color, and one can easily eat three or four of these, without recognizing that fact. These must be carefully packed, and well-padded, if their wonderful flavor and  good taste is to be enjoyed whole. Just set a few out on a plate, and watch them disappear.\n\nI have eaten so many of these over the years, we used to get  them only during the holiday season.  My entire family is addicted, and If you like  nothing betterr than a lovely,  crumb texture, and a rich golden crumb, these are for you.\n\nThey are worth the occasional splurge-out for a truly super Scottish Cookie.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWalkers Shortbread Animal Shapes, 6.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese chocolate shortbread cookies are extremely cute. The idea of baking Scottish Shortbread into the shape of a Scittie dog was a good one. They are just so cute, you really do not want to eat them. I gave several boxes to friends with little dogs that resemble the cookie dog. They all laughed and enjoyed the cookies.\n\nWalker's Shortbread is an old, well-established, and top-quality of Scottish shortbread. Normally it projects an intense buttery aroma, and is light, flaky, and crumbly. Walker's is the very standard for what good shortbread should be. Therefor,e,  I was a tad bit surprised to find that these cookies were not quite up to the normal Walker's quality.\n\nThe boxes of cookies were fresh and undamaged, not a broken cookie in sight, so that could not be the problem. It appears that the alterations required to produce a chocolate shortbread batter make a less flaky and delicate cookie. The chocolate taste was just a bit strong, lovely for chocoholics , but less exciting for the pure shortbread contingent.\n\nThe most noticeable feature of Walker's shortbread has always been the amazingly rich and buttery fragrance, along with a light and delicate crumb. The addition of chocolate tends  to obscure the buttery fragrance,  Also,, the texture of the chocolate variety of this Walker's Shortbread is a bit tougher, and the crumb is less fine thanthat of the standard Walker's shortbread.\n\nIf you are a big fan of chocolate, and prefer more of that taste, then these cookies will be quite suitable for you. If, as some are, your entire shortbread experience is heavily based-upon the rich and buttery flavor, and the fine crumb, you will be better served with the original, and non-chocolatey version.\n\nThese are nice cookies, the  little dog figure is quite sweet,  and they are of high quality. For chocolate lovers everywhere, these are a fine choice.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nRoland Sushi Ginger, 16 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI eat a lot of sushi, and acquired a strong liking for pickled ginger. I ordered this ginger, and am pleasantly surprised by the price and the taste.  It is thinly sliced, although there are a few thicker pieces mixed in. It is quite spicy, not too sweet, and tastes very good. it is sweetened with sugar, not aspartame. There is no artificial red food coloring in this product. Recommended for other pickled ginger fans.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFantastic World Foods Original Hummus, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI received this order in a timely fashion. I immediately made one box of the mix, the powdered mix smelled pretty strongly of concentrated lemon flavor. However, after I added the water and oil, the odor disappeared. I added 1 clove of crushed garlic and some Cayenne Pepper. The mix is very tasty, very similar to \"real\" Hummus. It does not have a strong and artificial lemon flavor, indeed, I added a few squeezes of fresh lemon juice. I have eaten Hummus for a very long time, I would never have guessed that this was made from a dried mix. Next time I will use 2 boxes of mix at once. It is very good and and 1 batch will not go far. I can highly recommend this to Hummus aficionados everywhere.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCarr's Table Water Cracker Selection, 6 Packages of 3 Varieties Inside, 1lb 9.5 oz. Box\nReview:\nYet another luscious assortment of Carr's English crackers. Carr's has long been a standard of quality that few in the world can match. Yes, they are expensive, but if you want the very best - go to Carr's, you will not be disappointed. This is an assortment pack of three types of the lovely\nCarr's Cream .Crackers : Original, Sesame, and pepper.\n\nEach cracker is quite thin, amazingly crispy, and full of a flavor explosion,, which whether eaten alone,  or with cheese, Prosciutoo and fruit, etc. is superb.\n\nThe original flavor is a less salty version of a superb saltine, thin, full of crispy layers, and possessing a rich wheat flavor. The sesame is the same cracker, but with added sesame, which adds a great deal to the flavor of the basic cream cracker. The basic cream cracker will not fight against any topping that one might choose to use. The sesame cracker is quite tasty, all by itself, but will be better with some cheeses than others. The pepper version of the cracker is the most pronounced, and the most dominant of all of the three crackers.\n\nThe pepper-flavored cream cracker is lovely all by itself, crispy, with a touch of salt, and a smidgen of the finest quality ground pepper. Non-pepper lovers need not fear the pepper cracker. The pepper taste is indeed noticeable, but will never be so overwhelming as to repel a taster, or any topping chosen to accompany iit. The only exception that I can think of would be sweet toppings,  which might not blend with those nuances as well as with the sesame and original form of the cracker.\n\nKeep a package of these on hand for unexpected guests, or tasty midnight nibbles. You will not be disappointed, and your guests will be most impressed by the high standards of your palate.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEden Kombu, 2.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis sea weed is the best that is currently available in most of America. It is the true, wild, hand-harvested, sea weed from the far northern Hokkaido Islands. The sea weed is sun-dried, and trimmed to leave only the central portion of the leaf, highly-valued its umami flavor. This is crucial for the preparation of dashi, which I prepare on a daily basis, whenever possible.\n\nI have tried Korean sea weed, and given it up as a bad job all around.  Eden Kombu is what is needed for those acquainted with the preparation of fine Japanese cuisine. This costs the earth, but it is worth it.\n\nEden is a reputable company, concerned with the quality of their offerings, and the satisfaction of their customers. I know this because I carefully checked the company's background, then spoke directly with a company representative at the company headquarters.i recommend this Kombu, you will not find better unless you find yourself in Japan.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['rice', 'one', 'taste', 'lovely', 'quality', 'flavor', 'good', 'many', 'beans', 'rich']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nGevalia Kaffe Peppermint Mocha Coffee\nReview:\nThis is the worst tasting stuff I've ever experienced in a T-Disc.

It requires quite a bit to taste a hint of sweetness. I was happy b/c I heard it was lower glycemic than regular sugar, etc etc...however, when you have to triple the amount you would use just to taste a little hint of sweetness, it cancels out b/c you end up using more & getting more calories, carbs, etc. I could use half of the amount of regular sugar to achieve the slightly sweet taste I like in my coffee. Seriously..I had to dump a whole lot of it in my coffee just for a little sweetness. Sorry, just don't think its strong enough, which leads to using more to achieve the taste your after. Regular sugar, maple syrup, or honey is 10x sweeter while using MUCH less. Just get organic & call it a day. Will stick to what I was using...Organic maple syrup or Date sugar.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nEndangered Species Panther, Natural Dark Chocolate Squares (88% Cocoa), 10-Count Individually Wrapped Pieces (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nDark and smooth.

Love the taste, quality & all around goodness of this yummy stuff. Kiddos love it, too. 2 thumbs up! Purple carrot mixed with a little grape juice, & my kids never even detect it.

When you first get the pump to put into a new bottle, you'll need to hold a cup or something under the spout and do a couple pumps.  You don't necessarily have to pump the liquid out, but you do need to get some of the liquid up into the tube so that you have room to screw the pump lid on without overflowing the brand new bottle of syrup.

I was a little surprised at the smaller size of the package, but that's my fault for not paying more attention to the weight.  These taste VERY good!  Fresh and soft with a slight denseness that comes with higher quality marshmallows, and perfect flavor.  I don't notice any aftertaste either.  I love them so much!  I didn't want to spend extra for the chocolate kind, so sometimes I'll layer it with a caramel Atkins square, and BOY that is heavenly!  They do raise my blood sugar a little bit, but nothing too dramatic.  Just don't eat the whole package in one sitting, because the sugar alcohol carbs can add up if you eat too much at once.

Imagine my heartbreak when I went Paleo and hadda give up Duke's because of the soybean oil. I read reviews that this mayo tastes just like Duke's. DON'T BELIEVE IT! It's much more tart than Duke's.

My 14-yr old loves it in her green tea every morning, I love it in my oatmeal and it makes amazing sugar-free treats, like cheesecake and whipped cream.\n\nHOWEVER, if you have animals (I have 2 cats and 2 dogs), keep it under tight lock'n key and make sure you're the only person who touches it. Even though the bag is resealable, I keep it in TWO Ziploc bags, from the top and bottom for added protection. I keep one measuring spoon in there at all times and treat it like a stick of dynamite when putting it in anything. Then I wipe down my counter even though I don't drop a granule.

But the angel hair is to die for. Just rinse in a colander with hot water for a minute or two, then dry fry in a pan until the liquid's evaporated. Toss with whatever makes you happy and chow down.

The ITC Hotel chefs who created this recipe are very well regarded in India. Its just the right mix for a spicy lamb curry, all you need to do is mix it with water and add the lamb and then let it simmer on your stove for 30-45 minutes to bring out the aromas and flavors. Really convenient and time saving.\n\nThe lamb curry paste is spicier than a butter chicken curry mix. The chicken curry usually has a more creamy consistency and is sweeter due to higher content of tomatoes. The lamb curry has a base of garlic, ginger, black pepper, onions, tomatoes and other highly aromatic Indian spices (bayleaf, cinnamon, star anise, cardamom, cloves, black cardamom, shah jeera, corriander seeds, red chilli powder etc.).\n\nI usually make my own curry as I prefer fresh ingredients but this mix is wonderful, it has just the right blend of spices that go into lamb curry. The secret to Indian food is to lower the flame once a curry boils and then simmer it for quite some time. This step is not a must if you're in a tearing hurry but it unlocks the real flavors.\n\nOnce done this curry keeps very well in the refrigerator. In fact, as with all spicy curries, it even tastes better the next day. I use two packets at a time to make an entree for 6 people.\n\nVariations:\nI sometimes add some 1X1.5 inch cubes of diced potatoes along with the lamb to absorb the spiciness which makes it into a \"Lamb Vindaloo\". Or you can use beef instead of lamb, it will taste great with any red meat that absorbs the spice.\n\nIf you're a vegetarian, you can use this curry with potatoes and green peas since the curry paste does not contain any meat in it. Just remember to add peas towards the end of the simmering process or they will get bleached out and you'll get a fantastic dish.\n\nPairing:\nPair this lamb curry with some aromatic basmati rice, cooked till all grains are done but still separate, and a bowl of plain yogurt (with a little sugar if you like) to counter the spiciness. Or you can also buy frozen Indian nan/roti from the local Indian grocery store, toast it in the oven and enjoy. Yummy!\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review. If you haven't received some of the features, only make use of the provided ones.

I just ordered my second jar. It was a hit at Christmas dinner, and were New England white people with palates of New England white people. I still prefer super spicy food and noticed some reviewers mentioned its not spicy enough. I say you just have to add more of this curry. In India spices are an ingredient not a condiment. Like, go crazy with this. Dump in a cup. Youll taste the spiciness then. What I will observe is that the flavors besides just spicy are big... but thats a good thing. My aunt had never tried curry and she loved this. My brothers girlfriend kept coming back for more and even the five year old loved it, adventurer that he is. My family is mostly vegan now so were really exploring new flavors and Im certain Ill be buying this again - as well as looking at other spices from this seller. I made veggie and red lentil curry using coconut oil and potatoes and diced tomatoes. Its a really fine grind - if youve cooked with curries you know this is best - and I like working with it better than paste. Its a great price too. One more thing, the packaging is easy!!!

You need fewer bags than you think - people always say 8-12 for a gallon but half that is better. Sometimes I'll add a green tea bag to mix things up. I truly enjoyed this tea, I'm glad I tried it, and I will use up the whole bag.

This powder fixes that - it makes a nice sauce in and of itself ((and it's good mixed into all sorts of other things, too!)), but it also makes a very good \"matrix\" into which very sharp, harder cheddar can be melted.\n\nThere are very few ingredients in it, which is why I decided to try it ;)\nSome folks have said it tastes like the here-unnamed \"famous boxed brand-name mac and cheese\".  I didn't grow up eating that, so I went ahead and tried some a few years back, shortly before I turned 58 - and I trashed it after the first bite. This is NOT that!!!  This is actually cheese, with some buttermilk and whey protein (which is a component of milk).  The yellow color is from Anatto, which is derived from the nut of a shrubby South American tree that's been used for food and other uses for thousands of years. Some people raise a fuss about Anatto because some folks do seem to have an allergy to it ((just as some people have an allergy to peanuts, and/or other various foods)), but Anatto is so widely used, including in butter, so if you're allergic, you probably found out early on.\n\nIn the absence of such an allergy, I recommend this as a tasty addition to one's pantry.  I haven't yet tried making any sort of cheese crackers or rolls with it, but I'm betting it would be good in baked goods as well, for those folks who like ((or need)) to make their own.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Buckwheat Flour, 22-ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI enthusiastically like everything I've gotten from Bob's Red Mill - the quality is always high, and I like that it's a o-op sort of arrangement.\n\nThe Buckwheat flour (like all of their flours) is fine and evenly-sized, delicious, and a pleasure to use, especially for those for those of us with wheat allergies.\n\nI have - and keep! - my pantry stocked with a variety of Bob's Red Mill non-wheat flours.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSuzie's Whole Grain Thin Cakes, Puffed Brown Rice Crackers, 4.9-Ounce Bags (136g) (Pack of 12)\nReview:\n- Basically, \"Suzie's Whole Grain Thin Cakes, Puffed Brown Rice Crackers\" are UNSALTED thin brown-rice cakes.  But the operative word there is THIN.  Maybe 1/4\"/apx 6mm or a bit less.  They also are less crumbly than \"regular\" rice cakes.  And the brown rice gives them a bit more taste and 'substance'.  I also think the size is perfect.\n - What I get is the ultra-plain, no salt, nothing-but-rice ones.  They're a bit bland, I guess, for eating on their own ((to me, they taste a bit like plain pop-corn)), but I generally use them as a substitute for bread ((I don't have a gluten problem - I have an allergy problem)), so I've used them for everything from little \"pseudo-Ruben\" type things, to mini-pizzas, to tuna \"sandwiches\", to having them with peanut butter.  Or just melting some cheddar on them.  And so on.\n - And again, they seem to me to be a little more \"dense\" and less crumbly than regular rice cakes.  So, they hold the toppings, and don't clash with anything.\n - As long as they keep selling them, I definitely will keep getting them, because they are, for me, the best \"bread substitute\" I've found.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSan-J Tamari Gluten Free Soy Sauce, Non GMO Black Label, 64 Ounce\nReview:\nThis is my favorite soy sauce - it's 100% soy, NO WHEAT, hooray!, and it's delicious.  I use soy sauce frequently, so yeah, I bought the humongous bottle, LOL!  Not sure what else I can say about soy sauce...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTinkyada Brown Rice Fettucini Gluten Free, 14-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI bought this at a grocery store because I have a wheat allergy and can't eat wheat pasta, and now am ordering from Amazon so I can be assured of a steady supply.  This is by far THE BEST non-wheat pasta I've ever had!  The texture is not at all grainy, but rather, is smooth very pleasant, *very* much like \"regular\" pasta; the flavor is excellent ((I do not at all like the wheat-free pastas that are made with corn :p )); and it's *easy to cook*, tolerates even a bit of over-cooking, and retains its structure - some non-wheat pastas get crumbly, but not this one.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Co-op Organic Korintje Cinnamon, Ground, A Grade, 1 Pound Bulk Bag (Pack of 2)\nReview:\n- This is DELICIOUS cinnamon!\n - I never ordered spices online before very recently, and when I saw that this was from Frontier, I gave it a whirl.\n - My expectations were definitely exceeded!\n - It is very fragrant and has a full-bodies flavor, without the harsh edges that the common store bought \"cassia\" type has.  I've bought Korintje cinnamon locally in the past, but this Frontier cinnamon is sooooooo much better!\n - It came in two bags, so I popped one into the freezer and transferred part of the other to a \"daily use\" container, and keep the main bag in the fridge.  I was worried that I would \"never go through that much\" but it's so good that I'm going through it faster than I had anticipated ;)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStarKist Premium Ocean Clams, Chopped, 6.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\n- I expected these chopped clams to be in teeny little pieces, but actually, there are a lot of decently-sized pieces in them.  They have a nice fresh flavor, and are not too salty.  Much better than I had expected, to be honest!  I've been enjoying everything I've made with them :)\n - I received them quickly, too :)\n - So yes, I'll get these again, to be sure - better pricing than the local grocery store, and that's when I can get someone to go to the store for me, since I can't get around well at all at this point.  So I really appreciate that I can not just order food, but best!, receive GOOD food :)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSesmark Gluten Free Rice Thins, Teriyaki, 4.25 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\n- These are one of several wheat-free AND corn-free ((yes, I really am allergic to both...)) bread-and-cracker-alternatives I've tried.\n - I like these a lot.  They are seasoned with soy sauce, but lightly, so they go really nicely in my opinion with a variety of toppings, but also are quite good by themselves.\n - They do contain have salt/sodium, so if that's important for anyone's particular diet, check the description, I think the levels are listed.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStarKist Chunk Light Tuna, In Water, 11 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\n- This is the best way ever to buy tuna!  My mobility is not what it once was, so first of all, I like being able to order items.\n - Second, although I know that the cans are recyclable, I have to admit that I prefer the flavor and texture, AND reduce draining required, of the tuna packed in these things.  Again, with reduced mobility, it's preferable to me to open one envelope, to having to open and drain three cans.  It's more expensive than buying the cans in bulk, but there also is no risk that I'll order them, drive out the 12 miles or so to pick them up, and then find they are \"out of stock\".  These came right to my mailbox and arrived pretty darned quickly at that.\n - The freshness date was also excellent.\n - So, as with all things, one has to set one's own priorities.  Buying this was is a bit more expensive, but it was highly reliable, a good buying experience, and a quality product which is convenient and easy to use.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHoosier Hill Farm Gourmet Dark Chocolate covered Espresso Beans (1 lb Jar)\nReview:\n- Dark chocolate - rich, smooth, and not overly-sugary.\n- Nicely crunchy-toasty coffee beans.\nNUM NUM NUM!!!!\n- What more needs to be said?\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'also', 'good', 'flavor', 'one', 'use', 'get', 'well', 'delicious', 'bit']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nSell's Liver Pate, 4.25 Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nSells sells individual cans for $4ish so I thought I was getting a great bargain for a case of 24.

One of my favorites from Mighty Leaf.\n\nDon't over-brew this one:  Usually white teas require five or six minutes to steep, but this one will loose its peach and melon flavor if steeped that long.  No more than three minutes works well for me.  Also, do not use boiling water; let boiling water sit for several minutes before pouring over white teas (or do not bring it to a boil).

When I don't have an appropriate fresh fruit, and I need a sweet-sour-spicy salsa for fish or chicken, I grab this can.\n\nThe pineapple is as close to fresh as it can be.  I buy the chunks so I can chop it into smaller pieces myself.  I believe the bigger chunks hold their flavor in the can better.  And we like a bigger chop than what comes crushed, and a smaller chop than comes with the tidbits.

So, I cooked this up during the day, just to give it a try.  I tasted a few spoonfuls to confirm that my pre-conceived opinion was correct, then I dumped the rest.  I didn't even want to give it to the chickens in the yard, because I felt the wimpy noodles and excessive salt were not healthy for them.\n\nThis package makes two cups prepared pasta.  One cup is considered a serving size.  I was appalled to see that one cup of this stuff contains 31% of a person's recommended daily salt intake.  And I could only stand at the counter and shake my head when I read that two cups of this weighed in at 580 calories--and this is just a side dish?!?\n\nIf you try this product, remember to not exceed the 12 minute boiling time in an effort to get the sauce to thicken; your noodles will be mush.  Thickening occurs during the two minute resting period after you take it off the flame.\n\nI don't know why anyone would bother with this product, as it isn't even a true \"convenience\" food that you can pop into the microwave at work.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nZICO Watermelon Raspberry Coconut Water Drink, 16.9 fl oz, 12 Pack\nReview:\nHaving been lucky enough to have once lived in an area where I was able to crack open as many fresh green coconuts as I desired, I must say that the flavor in these bottles is decent:  Not perfect, but not bad.  I had to get it really, really ice cold to achieve the correct flavor.  Coconut water right out of the shell is extremely refreshing, and I don't think it can ever be correctly duplicated.  (Same like the juice from a freshly-squeezed lime or lemon loses its true taste as it ages.)  But his offering from Zico comes close.  And the aftertaste is authentic, too.\n\nI don't think that all people understand that fresh coconut water does not taste like coconut meat.  Coconut water has only a hint of the flavor of  coconut meat, and it has a slight tang and almost a slight \"soapy\" taste.  It is nothing like coconut milk or coconut cream.  And its nothing like the coconut flavor in a pina colada.\n\nI'll say it's decent enough flavor to bring back memories of shaking green coconuts to listen to the slosh of the water inside.  Then taking a machete and trimming off the top of the tough outer green of the coconut.  The final swipe would expose a hole to the inside.  Bring it to the lips and some water would always trickle down my chin.  When the water was gone, I would crack the coconut open and use one of the ovals from what was trimmed from the top to scoop out the jelly inside.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLee Kum Kee Premium Oyster Sauce, 18-Ounce Glass Bottles (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nYes, this oyster sauce is more expensive than many others, but it gives so much more flavor that it is worth it to me.  It has a richness that the others do not have.  It has a meaty flavor.  It has a deep flavor.  If I want to quick throw a stir fry together, I drizzle a tablespoon of this oyster sauce, a tablespoon of a hoisin, and a bit of low salt soy sauce.  It makes a great sauce!\n\nI've been using it for years and am never without a follow-up bottle on my pantry shelf.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Chef's Naturals Slivered Almonds, No Preservatives, Non-GMO, 2 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nAlmonds taste fine, but the bag I received contained more little pieces and brown skin than pretty slices.

I found them in a one pound bag, but it's hard to keep them fresh when a recipe only calls for a few ounces.  That is why I really like this packaging from Fisher.  These hazelnuts are very fresh.\n\nThey are already chopped and convenient for many applications.  Be aware that in chopped form, it is not easy to remove the skins.  Some recipes call for skinning the nuts.

I suppose if I was starving, I might make a dent in this bag, but since we first opened it a week ago, it is still sitting on the shelf.\n\nI don't know how they decided to call this flavor mix \"Bold\", because it is milder that a Ritz cracker or the plainest Dorrito.  It's got less flavor that an original Cheez-it.\n\nI did go through and pick out the dark \"rye/pumpernickel\" round chips; there were ten or so.  They didn't have much flavor to them; I think they were just dyed dark brown...  The two different Chex in this mix are not bad, but the pretzels have no zing, no tangy taste when they first hit your tongue.\n\nIf you empty this bag, if you are way too hungry to need this kind of a snack.  Grab a carrot or piece of celery--you will get the crunch you're looking for and a perkier flavor.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nBarilla ProteinPlus Multigrain Pasta, Thin Spaghetti, 14.5 Ounce (Pack of 20)\nReview:\nMy eagle eye caught sight of this Barilla \"Plus\" on the grocery store shelves about two years ago.  At that time, I was starting to feel guilty about serving and eating regular semolina pastas once a week, and was in the mood for a change.  It was time to start cutting back on carbs and start looking for healthier choices.  I had given the Barilla whole wheat pasta a chance and the family nipped that in the bud.  So when I first saw the \"Plus\" I did not hesitate to grab a box off the store shelf.  It costs more than the regular, (always about a dollar to a dollar and a half more than the blue box Barilla), but it seems eating healthy always does cost more...\n\nFrom the very first box--which, by the way, was the bow tie (farfalle) shape--we loved the taste.  Its flavor is not the same as \"regular\" semolina:  It is more flavorful, with a richer, nuttier, \"bigger\" taste.\n\nThen we tried the rotini, and I realized I had found the perfect choice for cold pasta salads.  The \"Plus\" in general does not absorb as much moisture as the semolina in the blue box, so it has great holding power in cold salads.  And the ridges of the rotini hold a thin dressing well.  The flavor of the Plus goes well with the olives, pickled and raw vegetables, salami, and feta or cojita cheese that I toss into a pasta salad.\n\nPlus is more toothsome also.  And it has less starch.  Which brings up the fact that it does not cook up the way good old semolina does.  With some of the shapes it has never been an issue.  For instance, one does not use farfalle in dishes that rely on pasta starch for some of the body of the sauce.  So, if I have a sauce made up in another pot, and it just gets spooned on top of the pasta, or mixed into the pasta, or if I am using this for a cold or room temp pasta salad, this is our pasta of choice.  If I need to use spaghetti or fettuccine shape, I don't use Plus, I use the regular blue box semolina.\n\nSo, here is a little tip:  Think twice before using this pasta where your sauce is minimal and you need some of the pasta water to add body:  This Plus will not do that for you.  It does not have the required starch.  Also, do not use a Plus pasta in a mac 'n cheese if you follow that sneaky little ingenious stove top recipe of cooking your pasta in milk then adding grated cheese and ta! da! you have a creamy noodle side dish in 25 minutes.  It is just not starchy enough.\n\nBut for everything else, this is a great pasta choice!\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['flavor', 'tea', 'like', 'one', 'salt', 'taste', 'water', 'product', 'use', 'flavors']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nStash Tea Lightly Sweetened Green Iced Tea Powder, 8 Count Packets (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis was a big disappointment.

I can only say I am disappointed by the product and hope my experience may be an aberration.\n\nUnlike most of the commercially available products, the flavor of these preserves is excellent.  It is natural and does not taste as if the flavor was enhanced during processing.  However, the consistency of the preserves reminds me of rubber cement - it is gluey and does not spread easily.  Fortunately, I use a lot of preserves on each bagel piece, so this gave me an excuse to pile it on.  I thought it might be that the jar I purchased was getting toward the end of its shelf life, but it still had 15 months until the pull date.  Further, the jar I opened first had whole strawberries through it, rather than smaller pieces.  While this may be considered desirable, I like to be able to apread the preserves and not just glop on chunks of berry.\n\nI enjoyed the Cherry Preserves immensely, but I think there are all-natural strawberry preserve products on the market that are better than Bonne Maman Strawberry Preserves.  In fact, one of the big box stores has its own organic strawberry preserves available in a quart jar; these have the same outstanding flavor of the Bonne Maman, but are not rubbery and the strawberries have been crushed rather than processed as whole berries.  I believe the cost is about $7 for that product.\nRating:\n3.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

We tried these warm and they were ok. We both agreed they were no like brownie (chewy and chocolatey)they tasted \"off\" but familiar. We agreed, they were more like a crumbly fudge cake. After we tried them cooled down, I figured it out what was off...it was too much baking soda/powder flavor. Not really sure but I know I got that after taste when I was learning to bake as a teen. If we ever try these again, we will load them up with other things like blue berries, chocolate chips, nuts, coconut, or whatever I have around.\n\nWould I recommend? It depends. I don't need a gluten free diet. So, for those who are like me in that way, then No. For those who need gluten free, then Yes.\n\nMy favorite brownie to date, is Trader Joe's brownie mix...oh, with Biscoff spread, OMG!

You might be asking, \"hey is she used to gluten free products?\", Well yes, been gf for about 6m & have eaten many noodles. Well it ruined my soup! I thought letting it sit would make it better. Nope! The funky taste got stronger. All that soup gone to waste. Then I realized this product is not made with GMO free corn. My mistake for not reading.

I have been using the other 2 brands for 5 or 6 yrs, this one I just started using about 6 months ago because grocery outlet had it on sale for seven dollars.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nLakewood Organic Super Veggie Juice, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI discovered this juice about 2 months ago and drink it every day.  I really enjoy it as a soup base... add some chicken stock, some vegies, onions, garlic, brown rice... way yummy! I pretty much just go through the fridge, freezer, and pantry and add leftovers.  The soup comes out different each time... great with linguica!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTaste Nirvana Real Coconut Water, Coco Aloe with Refreshing Aloe Vera, 16.2 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI really love this one... and I have tried several over the last few weeks.  The tastes have really varied with each and every one I tried and after reading all of  the reviews for the different brands, I've been struck with some realizations.  First of all... the different brands utilize coconuts from different parts of the globe.  That in and of itself would cause flavor differences.  But, the other thing that came to mind is how the same tree can produce different flavor and texture results in things like oranges and apples depending on the weather pattern for that season, etc.  Perhaps the same applies to coconuts?  In any case, of all the brands I've tried, this is by far my favorite.  I decided to try drinking coconut water to help with lowering my blood pressure and it has definitely done that.  So I am happy that I finally found one that I can happily consume and enjoy every day!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStarwest Botanicals Organic Arrowroot Powder - 1 Pound (16 oz)\nReview:\nThis is something new I am trying.... making my own organic makeup using this organic arrowroot powder as the base.

I don't use it everyday as it is too pricey for me to consume every day, but keep it on hand for \"emergencies\".  I eat it for stomach issues &/or sore throats.  I apply it topically for any cuts, bruises, bug bites, dried out old face from too much time in the garden.  I also use it on the boys (2 black labs) for the same issues... except for the complexion.  The taste is different as the manuka plant is in the same family as the tea tree oil plant.. not very tasty.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEden Foods Organic Buckwheat Hulled Whole Grain 16 oz 454 g\nReview:\nI purchased this from a local discount store and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I had it by itself, mixed with quinoa, mixed with black rice, and even as a breakfast cereal... sort of like cream of \"something\".  It has a great texture that holds up well whether eaten hot or cold and the flavor remains constant no matter the temperature.

They are indeed delicious - though I find the coconut and yogurt flavors come through much more strongly than the apricot.  They're somewhat more filling than Larabars - 235 calories vs. 180 calories, in both cases half fat.  There's big difference in saturated fat - 9 grams for \"Eat Natural\", 1 for Larabars, and \"Eat Natural\" bars have almost 20 times the sodium (95 mg, as compared to 5 mg), and half the fiber (2 grams as compared to the Larabar's four).  \"Eat Natural\" ingredients don't get any more unnatural-sounding than soya lecithin, glucose syrup, and dextrose - but the list is certainly a whole lot longer than my Larabar's \"dates, almonds, unsweetened apples, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon\" (yes, that's all).\n  These \"Eat Natural\" bars do taste good and are a little better at killing hunger pangs than Larabars.  I might buy them again sometime if I find I need a snack that's a little better at killing hunger but think I'll stick to Larabars in the meantime.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nEat Natural Bars: Almond &amp; Raisin with Brazil Nuts &amp; Peanuts, 1.76-Ounce, 12-Count Boxes\nReview:\nNot something I'll buy again - rather bland puffed rice and nuts (mostly Brazil nuts and almonds), sweetened with glucose syrup and with some raisins mixed in - the only fruit I could taste, though the ingredient list includes apricots and peach.  The result is bland as well as overly sweet.  Though \"Eat Natural\" yogurt-coated almond & apricot bars are even sweeter, they're far tastier and would be my choice if I were to buy \"Eat Natural\" bars again.  I prefer Larabars to either - though I know they're not everyone's cup of tea.

AND mostly xylitol - the sugar substitute I prefer anyway.  So I order one bag to try it, and quickly went back to order more.\n\nIt's great stuff - more like light brown sugar than dark brown, so I need to add a tad of molasses in some of my baking.  And of course like plain xylitol, it's much drier than sugar, but adding a little applesauce to whatever I'm baking helps with that.\n\nBut mostly I use it on my breakfast cereal - sprinkling cinnamon in the bottom of the bowl, adding&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bob-s-Red-Mill-Gluten-Free-Whole-Grain-Rolled-Oats-32-Ounce-Bags-Pack-of-4/dp/B002TXT502/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain, Rolled Oats, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;and a handful of raisins, microwaving it, and topping it with Ideal Brown no-cal sweetener.

I look at dishes that call for plain TVP but am not so sure I'm ready to try them yet\n\nWhen a dietician told me I should to add more protein to my breakfast and suggested adding an egg (ugh - really don't like eggs), I tried adding a couple of tablespoons of it in my morning oatmeal.  It needs a bit of flavoring (cinnamon and/or raisins plus some stevia for sweetening) to keep from tasting like dog kibble, but with the flavoring it tastes great and I can really tell the difference in the amount of energy I have in the morning.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBarney Butter Almond Butter, Bare Smooth, 16 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThis is pretty good - tastes like a slightly bland peanut butter and is an excellent substitute for peanut butter when baking for a crowd that may include kids with peanut allergies.  That's what I bought it for, along with having it around to eat a spoonful now and then as a quick snack that's low in sugar (3 grams in a 2-tablespoon serving).\n\nJust one problem: getting the jars open.  I'm on my second 3-jar shipment and managed to wrestle the first four jars open.  A couple really were easy; another two more difficult but do-able with some effort if I tapped the lids firmly around the edges and used jar openers - one to hold the jar, the other to turn the lid.  The fifth jar was impossible.  I finally turned to my husband, who struggled with a while himself before finally getting the lid unscrewed.  On the plus side, it's packed in a plastic jar, so we were planning to cut the thing open and move the contents to a Ziploc container if we had to.  But I do wonder why manufacturers, in the interest of preventing tampering with food, make containers so difficult to open that people stop buying the product - which is what I'm going to do if I find another jar as difficult to open as this last one.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['good', 'taste', 'sugar', 'like', 'one', 'much', 'great', 'used', 'bars', 'though']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nTrue Orange Crystallized Fruit Wedge, 32 Pack\nReview:\nTrue Orange is awesome.

NOT mushy, sticky or goopy - unless you over cook it (just like wheat)...takes about 10-20 minute on a high boil to ready to eat. It is not enriched pasta (FYI) so the nutrition is that of plain white rice (but excellent also in the nothing is added) its all natural, just unenriched plain white rice and water. I've used this actually to make rice pudding and pasta salads. Just cook it up and put it in the food processor with either honey or sugar or on another occaision some tuna and celery - green peas/mayo - and one whirr - Bam you have deli style pasta salad! Use your imagination with this. I know, you're thinking - but 12 of them? Hey, once you start eating this you'll realize it goes fast (for a person who cannot have other grains). I only wish the company would make this white rice pasta in all the other shapes/types that they do in the brown pastas. [...] So please, if you like this kind please contact them as ask as I have for that to happen. They say they follow consumer demand - so lets DEMAND macaroni, linguini and all the rest too! The company that makes this is in Toronto, Canada.

They're a legit superfood, however, the price is outrageous.  If you're comparing them with a dried snack fruit like raisins, they're 8x the cost (for organic). If paying $6 for an afternoon snack is up your alley, then there probably isn't a much better snack for you than these Goji berries.\n\nMy only beef with goji berries are that they are BONE dry.  So dry, in fact, they could hurt your teeth, if you have sensitive teeth.  I actually know someone who chipped a tooth on goji berries.  Soaking them is ideal, and then using the juice in smoothies, not to waste the antioxidants that washed off into the  water.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

The powder itself provides:\n\n60 calories per serving with 10 grams of protein (almond milk adds 30/1, respectively),\n4 grams of prebiotic fiber, with .5 grams of sugar, 90 mg of sodium,( 1/0/180),\n50 mg of potassium, and no total fat, saturated fat, or trans fats.(170/2.5/0/0).\n\nEach serving is .8 of an ounce by weight using the enclosed plastic serving spoon and it is to be mixed with either water or unsweetened almond milk. With water, it is chocolatey and filling but not very tasty; with regular milk, which is not recommended in the directions, it tastes better and is filling; but the fat, vitamins, and sugar content must be added to the nutrition facts on the Designer Protein can; and with unsweetened almond milk it tastes much better. It tastes better with almond milk which can be expensive, but water is an option. The chocolate cookies and cream taste was achieved in my case using Blue Diamond \"Almond Breeze unsweetened almondmilk\". Highly Recommended for the health benefits and the low price.

It also packs 28 grams of sugar, 34 carbs, 3 grams of fiber, 160 mg of sodium, and 5 mg of cholesterol, and 210 calories.\n\n Beyond this, in a 10 ounce bottle and based on a 2000 calorie daily standard, it has 30% of Vitamins A, D, and C, 15% Vitamins K and B12, 20% foliate and iron, lesser amounts of thiamin, niacin, B6, & riboflavin, and an impressive 40% Calcium. A special point is that it does not contain high fructose corn syrup. The only drawback for some may be the high sugar content, but it gives a delicious protein, sugar and vitamin boost.

Here are some tips on using it:\n\nRehydrate your TVP in a double or triple strength liquid, like bouillon or soup base with twice or triple the recommended amount added to the water.\n\nCover the TVP with the bouillon or soup mixture until it kind of sloshes around.  It will absorb more liquid over time.\n\nAfter the liquid has absorbed (usually 10 minutes or so) taste test it to see if the seasoning is to your liking.  You can add more seasoning, or add more TVP depending on how strong it is.\n\nOnce it's at the right flavor, use your culinary skills to give it some kick.  Add an egg and some breadcrumbs, and make TVP burgers or \"meat\"balls.  Add some cumin, onion, garlic, and chili, thicken with a little starch, and you get TVP taco filling.  The possibilities are endless!\n\nBIG SECRET tip: Use a little sugar in your hydrating liquid if you are going to brown the TVP in any way, as in taco filling or patties.  The sugar will help it brown (Google: Maillard Reaction) And if your dishes are tasting salty without tasting \"savory\" try adding a little nutritional yeast, or yeast extract.\n\nMy only complaint: this TVP is pale, like breadcrumbs. I like my TVP to have a nice dark color usually, but it all tastes the same, so not a big deal.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPopin' Cookin' Happy Sushi House by Hamee\nReview:\nIt's not sushi flavored, don't worry!  :)\n\nMy favorite part are the little \"eggs\" made by dropping one mixture into the other.

I buy from Amazon because of three main reasons:  first, the price is right--shipping is free, and the price is competitive.  Second, I can't find this coffee in Northern California (where I live) as none of the grocery stores seem to carry it.  Third, they automatically ship it two you at intervals you select (I started with every two months, now I'm at every three months).  It's a high quality coffee, full of flavor, and the packaging (like most of the better coffees) tends to prolong the quality.  I am somewhat of a connoisseur of coffee; I grind my coffee and I use a French press to get maximum flavor.  I highly recommend the coffee and buying through Amazon.com.(and no, I don't get a percentage, this is an honest appraisal for the reasons I listed above).\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Quinoa naturally has a slightly bitter coating which has to be rinsed off. This can be a little bit difficult since it's such a tiny seed. That means it has to be rinsed in a fine mesh strainer and often sticks to the strainer This product saves that step. It's already washed. Quinoa is nice for a change of pace from rice or other grains but can be prepared in much the same manner. It's actually a seed and not a grain and has a more complete protein profile than rice. I usually prepare it in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stainless-Steel-Rice-Cooker-Model-ME81-Formerly-ME8-by-Miracle-Exclusives/dp/B000I5UEQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stainless Steel Rice Cooker Model ME81 (Formerly ME8) - by Miracle Exclusives</a>&nbsp;and often mix it with barley or brown rice and cook them together. I use about two parts of water to one part quinoa. I often use it for Tabouli Salad to replace the bulgar. I've also used it in pilaf and in chilled salads with vegetables. It works very well in a rice pudding type of dish too. (In place of the rice.)\n\nQuinoa has an impressive nutrient profile as well. It has 50% more protein than brown rice and more fibre. A cup of brown rice has 14 per cent of the recommended daily fibre. As good as that is, quinoa does rice even better, with 21 per cent. It also is one of the few plant sources that contains a complete protein meaning that it has all of the protein forming amino acids.\n\nSample received for review.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEmergency Preparedness &amp; Survival Gluten-Free Food Supply - All Natural, Kosher, Non-GMO - 10 Year Shelf Life - 15 Servings\nReview:\nThese aren't the kind of jelly beans where you stuff a handful into your mouth.  These are meant to be savored and enjoyed one at a time.  Each has a vibrant, distinctive flavor, the kind you want savor, one at a time.  And this sampler is the perfect way to try a variety of David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans.  It provides a nice variety including bacon, black cherry, blueberry, coconut, cranberry, ginger, grape, green apple, Himalayan sea salt, lemon, orange punch, peach, pomegranite, root beer, strawberry and vanilla bean.  All of them were very good, but my personal favorites were strawberry, lemon, coconut and bacon.  I have to admit that the bacon was a strange flavor for a jelly bean.  Maybe that's why I liked it.  It had sort of a burnt flavor, like bacon when it's crispy.\n\nThese jelly beans use natural flavors that are quite intense.  One of these small beans fills your whole mouth with flavor.

The bacon, ginger and Himilayan Sea salt flavors from this sampler are included, but there is also a chipotle, Thai chili, wasabi and a habanero jelly bean that is three-alarm hot!  If you like unusual flavors you have to give them a try too.\n\nFrom what I understand David Klein created the first gourmet jelly beans some 35 years ago, so he's quite accomplished when it comes to unique flavors that are fun to taste.

The flavors remind me of summer. It doesnt contain any regular tea leaves, making it actually a tisane. Ive switched to caffeine-free drinks lately, so this is perfect. The flavors make it a natural for an ice tea but its also very good as a hot brewed tea. To make it iced, I just brew it hot with a smaller amount of boiling water, and then add ice once its brewed.\n\nIve been using a lot of loose teas lately because I like having more control over the strength of the Tea and because its actually quite a good deal moneywise using the loose rather than teabags.

They aren't too sweet which I appreciate when trying to lose weight and not overeat, because they don't give my that blood sugar spike that a lot of energy bars give which end up making me want to keep eating. These are satisfying and I love the jalapeno. It's heat is bold but not overwhelming. For me, it's just the right amount of heat. One bar is 230 calories but with all the almonds, pumpkin and hemp seeds it's very satisfying makes me feel full for a couple of hours after I eat one. The ingredients are: almonds, pumpkin and hemp seeds, honey, non-GMO glucose, and pea crisps, jalapeno chili, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked sea salt and sunflower lecithin. The nuts and seeds are whole, not mashed into some gooey mass and baked. I like being able to taste the indivual ingredients. The slight smoky taste is perfect with the other natural flavors. These are more savory than sweet.  I will definitely keep buying these.\n\nUpdate 4/8/15 - I just had one of these bars from a different box, a box of 4. The heat was gone. I could barely taste it. I hope it was just that bar and not the rest of the box as well. The heat was what I liked about this bar.

This is some of the best coffee I've tasted. When brewing it in our Chemex 10-Cup Classic Series Glass Coffee Maker with a stainless steel coffee filter. the whole kitchen smelled like a coffee shop. This is a nice dark roast, much like a French roast. These beans are from Columbia, Guatemala and Sumatra and they have a nice smooth taste with no bitterness at all. The flavor is rich with just a hint of spice. They arrived in a stay fresh, heavy bag that is easy to re-seal. The beans were obviously very fresh because even before grinding them my kitchen was filled with their aroma. I love brewing coffee in the Chemex because I think it makes one of the best cups of coffee. But when I want just a single cup and am in a hurry, I've been known to use a refillable stainless K-cup in a Keurig and this coffee tastes pretty amazing brewed that way as well.

It is best with other ingredients mixed in and this tomato and basil tuna works very well together. It's a good snack food that packs some protein but could also be a good diet lunch with 200 calories if you added a salad.  I'm not so sure I like the idea of crackers packaged with it. The crackers are fairly bland, as they should be when they're offered with a topping. But I'm not sure I like tuna piled on top of crackers. It tends to fall off and I don't think it actually adds much except a lot of extra packaging and cost. I understand that the crackers may be included to use in packed lunches, perhaps to compete with a product like Lunchables. But I'd rather see this Tomato Basil Tuna sold alone in a 6 or 7 ounce can.\n\nI like the pop top can so a can opener isn't needed and it can be eaten anywhere with nothing else needed but a fork. It has only 120 calories for the tuna and 80 calories for the 6 crackers. The tuna is densely packed, not all watery like some cans of tuna. Still, I'd rather purchase a larger can of the lemon pepper tuna (with the pop top) and forget the crackers.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nDr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Tamale Soup with Baked Chips, 2.4-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nWhen I first checked the nutritional label, I was impressed that this soup was only 100 calories--until I looked more closely I realized that this little cup is shown as 2 servings and is actually 200 calories for the cup.  The soup is fairly thick, but still, it's not a large cup and I can't imagine dividing it between 2 people.  I think the whole thing should be shown as a single serving.  That said, the flavor is OK, but it is mainly a starchy soup of ground corn and corn flour with a few beans thrown in. I could sort of taste some peppers but couldn't really see any. I'm not sure I would buy it again.  It's a handy way to enjoy a quick lunch that you could take along to work or have at home.  You do have to be careful with preparation or you end up with a thick congealed mass on the bottom of the cup.  I would suggest mixing very well after adding water and then stopping the microwave a couple times while cooking to remix, making sure you scrape along the bottom of the cup as you're mixing so you don't end up with dry product stuck to the bottom.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'flavor', 'tea', 'good', 'one', 'use', 'coffee', 'nbsp', 'also', 'taste']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nNewman's Own Organics Raisins, 0.5-Ounce, 14-Count Mini Boxes (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nNot quite as tasty as the Made in Nature dried plums, they are very good, and a little less expensive.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Up until I tried the Lindt Supreme Dark 90%, I'd been enjoying the Lindt Excellence Extra Dark 85% Cocoa. The 90% cocoa bar definitely has a deeper, more earthy/rich chocolate flavor; something to keep in mind as I could see it being perhaps \"too dark\" for some people (although, personally, there's no such thing as TOO dark). Also, the consistency is noticeably more...I suppose \"buttery\" -- as it melts, it has a slightly creamier, smoother mouth feel than chocolate of a lower percentage. Dark chocolate is a daily indulgence for me, and I'm always on the hunt for the most premium/superior grade product. Of all the bars I've tasted so far, this is up there--like, top 3. If it's of any help/relevance to someone comparing brands and percentages and whatnot, I much prefer Lindt as a brand over Ghirardelli. In my opinion, both the Lindt 90% Supreme and 85% Extra Dark are tastier overall and much richer (chocolate-ier? lol) compared to, say, the Ghirardelli 86% Midnight Reverie. I eat a square of this bar every afternoon, and I've already repurchased it twice more since first trying it. Worth mentioning since I'm always looking to try new/different brands of dark chocolate.

I prefer fruit flavored tea as I usually do not need to add very much sweetener if any to the flavored teas.  I can drink this tea without any sweetener at all which is a plus for me.  I find the flavor of this tea to be quite good considering that it not one of the more expensive teas that I have tried.  It is better to me served chilled than hot.  I prefer my tea to be very strong with very little sweetener & no cream at all.  I usually prefer teas either hot or cold based on the individual tea.  This is one of the flavors that is good either hot or chilled, but I do think the flavor is stronger when it is chilled.  They changed the ingredients a few years after it was marketed.  It was better prior to that change in ingredients.  It had a much stronger flavor previously, but it is still a good flavored tea for the price.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSerendipiTea Fiji, China Green Tea, Pineapple Papaya Cornflower Petals &amp; Natural Flavor, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nThis tea has a wonderful pineapple aroma, but unfortunately, the taste is not as intense as the aroma.

Try a recipe that uses yeast if you haven't, and if you can get the liquid/oil ratios right you won't be disappointed. I haven't tried the \"whipped egg-white\" recipes yet but now that I see the difference we'll be doing those next weekend (4th of July waffles!). I also tried Allie's basic recipe in the new \"higher-priced\" maker and it was better than our old \"lower-priced\" maker that finally died on us. So, good buckwheat waffles seem to be a combination of modifying the recipe and having a high-powered iron. I'll tell you this - I'll never make out-of-the-box waffles again without modifying the recipes.\n\nOriginal review: These are great - I will always have a couple of boxes on hand. They're better than the grocery store buckwheat pancakes, which contain wheat (this doesn't), because they are lighter and more moist. I still haven't been able to make them as light and fluffy as Krusteaz but I'm working on it.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Give these a pass and find some higher quality cookies.\n\nI love good lemon cookies, these really are not very good at all.  The lemon flavor is there but subdued and not terribly \"fresh\" tasting.  The cookie is soft to the point of crumbing in your hand and even taking one out of the package is likely to break pieces off and scatter your table with crumbs.\n\nThere are far too many unneeded ingredients and they use (or may use) palm oil and other cheap oils and high-fructose corn syrup.  For those to whom it matters, they use some level of genetically modified foods.  I do nor care and this is not really a genuine issue but many people do care and I present the facts so people may make their own decisions.\n\nI'd suggest not giving these to small kids as it is going to be an unqualified mess as the cookies break apart if you glance at them and a small child will simply turn this into a cleaning mess with sticky crumbs and bits of \"frosting\" all over the landscape.\n\nIn fact, I'd simply suggest giving them a complete miss regardless.  These are third rate cookies at best, in my opinion, and not worth the cost or calories.  Archway has always been a \"brand of last resort\" in my experience and nothing here changes my mind in the least.\n\nAddendum:  As others mention, these leave an unpleasant aftertaste that lingers.  I have half the package left and am simply tossing them into the food waste bin.  Just not good.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nBibigo Korean Gochujang Sauce, 11.46 Ounce, 2 Count\nReview:\nThis is the first time I've used Gochujang hot sauce after hearing about it for years and seeing it on many cooking shows.  Not sure I'll continue to use it though as it is one third sugar.\n\nNo idea if they are all like that but that's way too much sugar.  It occurs three times on the ingredient list in various places and there's 10 grams of sugar in a 30 gram serving. Sugar is the next ingredient after peppers.  Ridiculous.\n\nThe flavor is good.  This stuff is no foolin' spicy.  I like it.  Good \"burn\" without overdoing it.  Reminds just a bit of Tabasco Sauce although the flavor is decidedly different.  There is (obviously) a sweet aftertaste as well from all that brown sugar and cane sugar.  Too much really for my taste.\n\nMaybe in summer if you can use it like a barbecue sauce to get that caramelized flavor on the grill it may work better, but for for my use it's just sugary hot sauce and I can get great hot sauces without all the extra sugar for a lot less money.\n\nNot meaning to harp on this as I'm not particularly a health nut but if excess sugar in your diet matters, use this with caution.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nJack Link's Meat Snacks Beef Jerky, Peppered, 5.85 Ounce\nReview:\nRather like Pastrami Jerky...and that's a good thing.  Hot without overdoing it, very peppery but not masking the rich beef flavor you get from Jerky.\n\nVery chewy, a traditional jerky that can pull fillings if you're not careful but worth the risk.  ;)\n\nOnly odd ingredient is \"Hydrolyzed corn protein\".  No idea what that is doing in my beef jerky but be aware if such things matter to you.\n\nOverall, a great snack and a very traditional one.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNongShim Neoguri Noodle, Spicy Seafood, 4.2 Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)\nReview:\nI was hankering for something a bit different from standard Ramen.  I gave these a try and they are a serious hit.\n\nThey take about ten minutes end to end using a microwave (I add some dried shrimp for a bit more flavor and Umami.  The noodles plump up well and have a good texture with a decent \"bite\" to them, they are not soggy paste. They don't dall apart and remind me of a decent pasta.\n\nThe broth is definitely spicy/hot.  Not \"burn your mouth \" hot but not fooling around either.  There's a great seafood flavor and an intruiging mix of ocean life (sand lance anyone?)\n\nAs usual, there's a ton of sodium so this may not be for everyone and it's not low calorie either, a full pack is a bit over 500 calories.  They play the usual game about portions and presume there's two portions in the bag.  I doubt most folk will divvy it up but there is enough that you could do so without feeling like you are making portions for a child's tea party.\n\nOn a cold, damp, rainy day, this is a nice way to warm up and I intend to keep some around and try their other flavors and maybe add some dried bonito flakes as well.  This stuff is a good platform for experiments.\n\nTasty, hearty and highly recommended to fill that void in your tummy or your craving for noodles.\n(Note, the product has origins in Korea I think but the version sold here is made in the USA.)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBuzz and Bloom Honey Creamy Spread, Original, 12 Ounce\nReview:\nA very creamy honey.  Easily spreadable with a knife or scoopable with a spoon but not pourable.\n\nMild honey flavor with just enough cinnamon to enhance it without overwhelming it.  I used it in my morning cup of very strong black tea and it works surprisingly well which I did not expect cinnamon to do.\n\nMelted onto toast or a hot bagel and you have an even better delight.  It would seem Ukrainian bees do a fine job of work.  ;)\n\nHighly recommended for a breakfast or snack \"change-up\" or to put some zip in your morning sip.  I suspect this will be superb in a cup of coffee with some Cognac or in a Mocha with some Coffee liqueur as well. I shall report back on this once I try one or the other. (I don't drink alcohol much so be patient.)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBumble Bee Sensation Seasoned Tuna with Crackers, Chipotle, 3.6 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nShredded tuna about one grade above cat food, doused with an annoyingly spicy chipotle sauce that is all burn and no taste.\n\nCan is annoyingly hard to open and the miniature plastic scraper almost useless in getting the tuna out without making a mess everywhere.  Have a napkin on the table or desk as you're going to get tuna crumbs all over unless you have the dexterity of a surgeon.\n\nThe included crackers are decent but not spectacular and work as a vehicle to hold the tuna and can be gently used to \"spoon\" upt he tuna once the can is somewhat empty.  Works better than the tiny plastic \"spoon\" provided/.\n\nThe chipotle flavor drowns out the tuna completely and lacks the subtle heat and warmth of the good stuff like the assorted \"rooster sauces\".\n\nThis will do as a back-up snack or such but only if you have water or milk or something to tame the annoying afterburn.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nPure Leaf Tea House Collection, Organic Iced Tea, Wild Blackberry &amp; Sage, 14 Ounce Bottles, Pack of 8\nReview:\nIt's summer.  Where I live has had record breaking heat and the joy of smoke from major brush fires.  Add in the place not being fully air conditioned (Didn't used to need it in these parts) and you have the \"prefect storm\" that is best quenched by a nice iced tea (at least until I get bids on adding real A/C).\n\nNow, while I enjoy iced tea, I am coming to dislike the heavily sweetened versions moistly available.  This particular line, while being sweetened, does use cane sugar rather than corn sweetener and uses it judiciously.\n\nA bottle of this is 90 calories while a similar bottle of \"Gold Peak\" is 180 calories. Another brand I like, Tea's Tea, is zero calories with no artificial sweeteners but is a bit more of an acquired taste if you are used to the fizzy corn syrup and water that passes for sodas and such in the USA.  (I do suggest trying it...the Jasmine green tea does not *need* sugar and your palate will awaken.)\n\nThere are multiple flavors in this particular assortment but I am only going to comment on the Sicilian Lemon and Honeysuckle as that is what I have had so far.  I may add an update when I get to the Blackberry and Sage one as that really sounds odd.\n\nShort form:  Good stuff, a refreshing drink that is not overly sweet.\n\nThe lemon is tart without being bitter or making you pucker and the honeysuckle brings up distant chords of memory from when my grandfather taught me when I was a child to pick and enjoy honeysuckle nectar right off the vine.  Refreshment and nostalgia in one bottle, a nice combo.\n\nif you want to advance your taste and selection past Lipton and Snapple, you won't go wrong giving these a try.  You might not like every flavor but experiment, you may find something you didn't know you loved.\n\nFlavor Update:  Just finished a bottle of the \"Blackberry and Sage\".  Interesting.  They use brewed blackberry leaves and brewed sage leaves along with the usual black tea.\n\nMakes for a different but not unacceptable variant.  The blackberry leaves add a deep, mildly tart note and the sage presents an almost savory aftertaste that is not unpleasant but does linger.\n\nI'd not want this every day but it is an intriguing variant on an old stand-by.  Worth giving it a try if you are curious at all about such things.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHonest Tea Organic Fair Trade Pomegranate Blue Gluten Free, 16.9 Fl. Oz, 12 Pack\nReview:\nI rarely drink sodas or overly-sweetened corn syrup concoctions so this came as a refreshing delight in a desert of sugary-glop and artifical nastiness.\n\nA half liter bottle has about 70 calories which means it has far less than half the sugar in a similarly sized bottle of \"pop\".  And what it does have is real sugar, not corn syrup or synthetic sweeteners that leave an aftertaste like C3-PO's gym towel..\n\nBeyond that, this is a delightfully refreshing summer drink.  Green tea and honey go well together and I generally open one up after trekking home from the store or such on hot summer's days.\n\nit is also a pleasant refresher for the late afternoon/early evening blah period as there is just enough caffeine for the tiniest of kicks without overdoing it.  I'd guess less than half the jolt of a cup of coffee or strong black tea.\n\nAll the relevant ingredients are organic and fair trade and there's just the things you expect in a bottle of tea.\n\nSimple, refreshing, not laden with synthetics and priced quite reasonably.  I find this to be just about the perfect drink.\n\n(Also, you may want to consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Teas-Tea-Unsweetened-Jasmine-Green-Tea-16-9-Ounce-Pack-of-12-Packaging-May-Vary/dp/B0017T6S1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Teas' Tea Unsweetened Jasmine Green Tea, 16.9 Ounce (Pack of 12) Packaging May Vary</a>&nbsp;when you want a light iced tea and no sugar at all.

There's only ten calories of real sugar and a minimal amount of non-needed junk added in.  You get a refreshing drink with a nice lemon-lime taste (for this variety) with no worries about your waist or pancreas.\n\nThe tiny amount of sugar is just enough to take the full edge off something sharp like lemon-lime without turning this into a sticky syrupy sweet \"soda\".\n\nI am very impressed with this as so many of the drinks in this class use various artificial sweeteners that, to me, leave nasty lingering aftertastes.  Even the so-called natural alternatives like Stevia taste wretched to me so this is a delightful find.\n\nWith the modern trend for \"dry\" sodas this can fit right in as it is tart and tasty and not at all a kid's drink (Although they may like it too and it's certainly going to be healthier.)\n\nAs a final note: The sugar is \"fair trade\" so you can even add a small glow of social justice to your thirst-quenching activities.  ;)\n\nAll in all a highly recommended product that I shall continue to enjoy and to purchase.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nJack Link's Beef Jerky, Small Batch Peppered, 2.25 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is one heck of a good bacon jerky.  Soft with incredible bacon flavor an freshness.  But,...there's not a lot of \"maple\" flavor at all.  Unfortunately, \"Maple\"  is thebarest suggestion int he flavor profile.\n\nOddly, the bag wafts a lovely maple-y flavor when you open it and even after the jerky is gone but the product just doesn't resonate with maple flavor.  I note that \"Maple flavoring' is far down the ingredient list so it's pretty obvious they didn't baste these in Maple syrup first.  Pity.\n\nHit the Internets for a good recipe for candied bacon and you'll get what Jack's is trying for if not as a jerky.\n\nThe other issue is the price:  This stuff if hideously expensive as in \"Costs more than an order of bacon and eggs sent by room service at an upscale hotel\" which takes it right out of the casual snack category and into the \"Hey, I won a small lottery drawing, let's celebrate.\"\n\nSo, the search for the perfect Jerky continues.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['flavor', 'good', 'like', 'tea', 'one', 'use', 'sugar', 'bit', 'get', 'without']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nCafe Altura Ground Organic Coffee, French Roast, 12 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI must say for the price of the coffee I was a bit nervous about what I might receive, but all I can say is that I am very pleased.  I would compare the flavor to a Maragoya, but a little lighter. It is a light roast so the flavor makes for an exceptional pairing to a simple breakfast of a croissant or other light bread, the flavor is by no means intense but it is there.  As for the acidic nature of the coffee I would place it is on par with most coffee house light blends and a below a Italian roast.  Overall a good coffee and if you do not like it, the tins are nice enough to make a present of or as a donatation to the church for after service coffee.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

There is a definite split in our population between those who become exuberant over their phony mango shampoos, etc. and those who know a toad when they see one.\n\nThis flavor combo is so intense it has even absorbed itself into my plastic insulated cup and I can't get it out. You know that highpitched overly sweet chemically induced maddness that resembles so many cosmetics these days. Out, out dammed spot for I have poisoned the queen...eek.  And all that sugar...omg no it is not better than aspertame. It makes children wild and mice sick and loves cancer.\n\n Make these doggone sodas yourself; get some seltzer better yet Perrier or mineral water, and add some real mango juice and yogurt or juice your own strawberries.  Naturalists avoid this simile made with benzyole hydrate and concentrate on the living.\n\n  And try using Xylitol....may have to dissolve it in warm water first but tastes much better than all the others and 1/2 the cal of sugar and natural to the body.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nV8 Golden Butternut Squash Soup, 18.3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI usually buy Wolfgang Puck's Butternut soup which is delicious and rich in flavor.

Ok it is decent but my after thought was it was more like a great idea for V8 to get rid of all its leftovers such as split peas while Puck's soup is unmistakingly the mark of a chef creating a unified flavor concept.

Bag &mdash; Organic, Non-GMO, Fair Trade, Gluten-Free\nReview:\nThe word \"cocoa\" comes from the Spanish word cacao which is a version of the Nahuatl word cacahuatl. The cacao tree may have originated in the Amazon's Andes foothills, and in Colombia and Venezuela, where wild cacao can still can be discovered. In Mexico, the Olmecs were cultivating cocoa by 1500 B.C. Before the Spanish conquerors, cocoa beans were a common form of currency in Mesoamerica (too bad our money system can't be this pure & simple!).\n\nThese high-quality, sustainable and ethically grown Navitas Naturals Cocoa Nibs are high in the benefits of cocoa, since flavonoids degrade during cooking and alkalizing processes (why you don't want Dutch-proceeded cocoa). Anyway, cocoa is a rich source of antioxidants, as well as flavanoids that contain epicatechin, which may benefit cardiovascular health and prevent heart-disease. In 2006, a study of elderly men found a 50% reduction in cardiovascular mortality, and a 47% reduction in overall mortality for those who regularly consumed cocoa (\"Cocoa Intake, Blood Pressure, and Cardiovascular Mortality: the Zutphen Elderly Study,\" Archives of Internal Medicine, 166(4): 411-7). And Navitas Naturals Cacao Nibs even contain 4 grams of protein per serving.

They didn't sit in the mail box long, but I discovered upon opening them that the chocolate was seriously melted. I put the box in the refrigerator. Not the best idea obviously because now the cookies were cemented together by the chocolate. Obviously this is no fault of the cookie manufacturer, but I do want to make you aware of what you might be dealing with if you mail order these.\n\nI'm a hormonal woman, so I found a way to eat the cookies, though they were so messy I ended up eating over the sink and creating a huge chocolate mess on my hands and face--I looked like a three year old.\n\nWere they worth the trouble? Sadly no. Ginger? What ginger? The dark chocolate isn't bad, but the cookie tastes like nothing. I was really looking forward to eating a ginger cookie, but there wasn't even a hint of it.\n\nIf you're on a gluten-free diet, you might find these tasty. I'm not and didn't.\nRating:\n3.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

The flavor balance is excellent, and the (added) peanut butter adds amazing richness and depth.\n\nI made it with the meat from a turkey drumstick leftover from Thanksgiving, and it was perfect. The hardest part was cutting the meat off the drumstick! The only other add-ins are chicken broth (6 cups), and a cup of peanut butter; I used mostly unsalted natural style, since i don't think high-fructose corn syrup would be a welcome addition to the flavors.\n\nI recommend this highly. It is only very slightly spicy; heat-lovers might want to supplement that a bit, though as-is, I can't see anyone objecting to it. If you are allergic to peanuts, I think sunflower butter would work equally well. I really liked the turkey in it, but the chicken the recipe calls for would be lovely, too.\n\nIt is also very filling. It makes 4 servings, and those make a very satisfying meal, possibly with a salad. It's even better after resting overnight in the fridge- the vegetables get more succulent, the soup thickens up, and the flavors blend.\n\nI will definitely be buying this one again!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMaldon Sea Salt Flakes, 8.5 ounce Box\nReview:\nI love how handy this was to order.

OK, one can sub in balsamic, but that's definitely going to change the flavor.\n\nI was very happy to find it available through Amazon, and I hope my 2 bottles last a while.\n\nAlthough the packaging was excellent, the shipping cost was itself about as much as 1 bottle of the vinegar. So, if you can find it locally, that would be better than ordering it.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Soups Hearty Meals Minnesota Heartland Eleven Bean Soup, 18-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is a hearty and delicious soup, and it was both pretty easy and made LOTS. I really love the flavor balance, and all the beans were done at the finish time,\n\nWe did go with all the add-ins: ham hock (ours had lots of meat), kielbasa, and chicken breast. All the meats were from our meat CSA, by the way!\n\nThe meat combination makes this a sort of American cassoulet (which traditionally has pork, sausage, and poultry confit).\n\nA nice crusty bread makes the perfect accompaniment.\n\nIt does take some serious elapsed time, though most of it is hands-off. It's probably 6+ hours from start to finish, though that can be divided into a couple of days. The physical prep is easy and straightforward- mostly chopping veg and the sausage and chicken.\n\nAnd, like all the frontier kits I've tried thus far, it does not taste like a mix. It tastes homemade.\n\nCan you do similarly yourself? sure! but I love the mix of seasonings and beans, and the meat suggestions, and just not having to THINK!\n\nVery recommended!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHoosier Hill Farm Dry Malt (Diastatic) baking Powder 1.5 lb.\nReview:\nMy husband and i do home brewing, so we are not unacquainted with malts.\n\nThe problem with malts is- they are very hydrophilic- meaning, as soon as you open them, they glom onto any moisture in the air and turn into a sticky and sullen mass.\n\nThe packaging for this one is a huge help. It's far easier to seal it against humidity. It's not 100% effective- but it's a huge help.\n\nI think if you are brewing, you'd do better to buy malt powders or syrups from your local homebrew shop. But when one needs an occasional tablespoon or quarter cup for baking- this is really handy.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHoosier Hill Farm Fermented Black Beans, 1.5 Pound\nReview:\nI do not live handy to a good Asian market, so I tend to either buy stuff online, or in the supermarkets.\n\nAs with spices, the supermarkets tend to charge a LOT more for smaller quantities.\n\nFailing a good Asian market opening up close, this kind of thing is great. It's a huge amount of fermented black beans for Chinese dishes, that costs per recipe a tiny fraction of what they do in the supermarket. The tightly-sealing jar in which they are shipped is also great.\n\nVery cost-effective, and of a good quality for Chinese black bean dishes.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nColgin Assorted Liquid Smoke Gift Box 4.0 OZ\nReview:\nLiquid Smoke is exactly what it says it is: a part of a distillation of wood that gives a smoky flavor to things that have not been smoked.\n\nI got this package because we have not been able to find anything but the hickory flavor locally- and that's a fine flavor, but I wanted a broader spectrum. This has the hickory, but also mesquite, apple, and pecan- and I'd never heard of pecan before!\n\nThey all smell gorgeous, and surprisingly different from each other- at least, it';s surprising if one has not done much smoking with various woods, which we have. All seem true to the species.\n\nI grew up on a \"smokey dip\" which used this stuff, among other things, to make a rich and really tasty dip for chips and veg. These days, I'll add a tiny bit to various braises, especially- not enough to even notice, usually, but it adds a complexity. I am very excited to have several choices for this!\n\nIf you just want \"liquid smoke\", I'm sure you can find the hickory in your grocery store for cheaper. But if you want more variety- well this is the best way to go that I've found!\n\nAlso note- it keeps forever, doesn't need refrigeration, and is generally used in very scant amounts. I am sure this package will last me at least 10 years.\n\nEdited to add:\nHere's the dip recipe!\n1 8-oz package cream cheese, softened (light is fine), mixed with roughly a tablespoon each of liquid smoke and lemon juice (scant), plus maybe a half-teaspoon garlic powder. Mix till smooth and taste- if it's harsh, add a bit more lemon, and add more garlic to taste- a lot depends on how potent your garlic powder is. If you end up overdoing either of these, a bit more smoke does not hurt. I start scant, then add more of each to taste. Once you have it tasing great, you can add a bit of milk to thin it down if it needs it.\n\nSO GOOD on chips and raw veg!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nOrange Blossom Water (Cortas) 10fl oz\nReview:\nI live in the suburbs, but am a fairly adventurous cook. This is occasionally a problem, since i find recipes thqat call for things that make my local grocers say \"huh?\" when I ask about them.\n\nI am very pleased to be able to buy this online. it's a big enough bottle that it should last me at least a year, which is wonderful.\n\nI am not thrilled that- with this and a couple of other items- I spent more on shipping than on my items... but sonce it's that or not have them at all, it's an acceptable trade-off. The company did wrap everything very securely and well, and I have utterly no complaints there-that was great, as is the quality of the item.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHavista Dried Wood Ear Mushrooms, White/Black, 2.2 Pound\nReview:\nI bought this package because it is hard for me to find Asian ingredients locally. The other packages of wood ears cost 67% as much for a quarter the quantity... and we love \"fungus\" in all forms, so yay for the big bag!\n\n-And it is HUGE.  Now it's also fluffy- the tree ears are not shredded, so take up a lot of space- but compared to other offerings it's a real bargain, and will give us yummy tree ears for many meals. The only trick will be storage, but we're getting food storage buckets.\n\nI am delighted with the quality and the quantity!\n\nEdited to add: Please note that the quantity in the headline is accurate, not the \"5 pounds\" mentioned in their product description. It is in fact 2.2 pounds. However, the quantity is enough to pretty much fill a 5-gallon food storage bucket; I have no idea what I would have done with twice as much!\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['one', 'good', 'also', 'great', 'find', 'flavor', 'would', 'able', 'much', 'love']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\n Quaker Oat Bran Hot Cereal, with Fiber and Protein, 16 oz Box (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI eat oat bran or multigrain cereal for breakfast daily and need some varieties.

I usually get players but wanted to try the Fisher brand and was pleased with their flavor and crunch. Planters dry roasted peanuts have a very mild flavor than works as a snack or you can use in desserts since they do not taste very savory. These Fisher dry roasted peanuts are way more savory in a good way that is great as a snack or on salads like This satay salad and such. I would not use these in desserts, you can really taste the paprika and spices, which I really like but you should be aware of.\n\nThere was a TON of spice sediment in the hat that I had to sift out to avoid dumping powder in my hand when grabbing a handful for a snack. I will be buying these in the future when this jar is finished, they are very satisfying and great on curry and thai dishes!

I think the coating has the same flavor profile as old fashioned dry roasted peanuts, the slightly seasoned ones I remember my grandma always having a jar of.\n\nI guess these are really a love them or leave them type of product; you'll notice the very high or very low star ratings, not one 3 star review when I tasted these.  I think the split is because the almonds do not have the word \"seasoned\" in the title so people looking for plain almonds feel duped.  I also see that some people are mad about them containing MSG; it is listed clearly in the ingredient list so you can avoid it if you have problems consuming it.  Some people get sick or bad headaches so this is an important thing to be aware of if you are sensitive.\n\nI can see how someone would be put off by any flavor if they were looking for plain; my advice is to always hunt down the ingredient list to any food you are planning to buy without tasting first, especially if ordering in bulk.  I went to the grocery store and got one jar of these to see if I liked them, when these are gone I will be getting these in bulk here on amazon since I paid almost $6 for one jar.

I tried the sauce as a cucumber salad dressing as soon as I opened the bottle. It worked very well. The sauce is smooth, has some sharpness to it, but is not overly spicy. After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator.\n\nMy impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna.  This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce.  Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon of the mayonnaise.  The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to the mayonnaise-based version.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce.  I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions. They both work equally well.  That is, I find it hard to tell the differences in taste.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBarilla Gluten Free Pasta, Spaghetti, 12 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI have been using Barilla pasta for quite a while.

So I thought we'd enjoy their lighter roast too when we want a less robust coffee.  This didn't do it though. It's an adequate coffee, meaning not terrible and it is fresh, but it's got a back sort of oily/clanky flavor reminding me of supermarket brands, which isn't terrible but not good either.\n\nI always freeze my coffee, taking out what I need for about a week and storing those beans in a container in the frig, so the coffee is always fresh and we use a Cuisinart grind and brew, which makes great coffee.\n\nI would use it again if I had to, but I wouldn't recommend it as Cameron's best nor would I go out of my way to buy it.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\n LorAnn Extracts, Natural Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste, 4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3) \nReview:\nWonderful product.

Now it's come down in price but it's not the same pasta.  It tends towards gummy - I don't overcooked and even al dente there's definitely a softer quality, a mushiness we don't like at all.  And when absorbing sauce loses all texture altogether.  If you save leftovers with sauce and reheat, you'll have a pile of gunk.\n\nI won't be buying again.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nCommunity Coffee Signature Blend Dark Roast Premium Whole Bean 12 Oz Bag (3 Pack), Full Body Rich Bold Taste, 100% Select Arabica Coffee Beans\nReview:\nThe box arrived on July 22, the date on the coffee bag is Sept 30.  So that doesn't leave much shelf time here.  Thing is, most vacpac coffee has at least a 6 month shelf life, so that is worrisome.\n\nOpened the bag, no smell.  That in itself tells the whole story.  Coffee is aromatic.  You open a bag of bean, particularly french roast bean and you're going to smell coffee, even before you grind it.  It's the nature of the oils on the roasted coffee beans, and it definitely affects the flavor and experience.\n\nno smell.\n\nBrewed up a pot this morning in my cuisinart coffee grinder/brewer:\nbeans were not consistant in roasting, some darker than others\nno aroma when brewing whatsoever\ncoffee turned out very dark\nmed chicory like flavor\ncoffee flavor not strong or rich.\n\nI've been playing with this coffee for a couple of days and after a while it's not terrible.  Compared to a stronger flavored French Roast, it pales.  But on it's own, if this is how you like your coffee, okay.\n\nI can't say if it's the blend of bean or if it's fact that it was roasted a long time ago and it's lost it's strength.  But it lacks a rich coffee flavor.  except it has that mild chicory backtaste going.\n\nso if you want a mild coffee with a hint of chicory, you found it.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nSplenda Brown Sugar Blend, 16 Ounce Bag (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is a most excellent sugar substitute for those who watch their sugar intake.\n\nBUT!!! (and this is important because one does tend to follow recipes to a fault) you must use half as much as the recipe calls for, which btw, does not work as well as you'd hope.  It's just not nearly as sweet cup for cup.\n\nI make that up using extra Splenda white because I use brown sugar for it's sweetness as well as the molasses flavor.  This is why I will only give it four stars....because they COULD make it cup for cup by doing what I do and adding more Splenda white so a baker could follow their recipe and not give it a second thought.  Heaven knows they're charging enough for it.\n\nI'm sure you know this:  Brown sugar is unrefined or molasses sugar.  You can make your own brown sugar by adding 1 tablespoon unsulfured molasses to 1 cup cane sugar and mixing it with a fork. It comes out nice and fluffy and you can control how much caramel flavor it has.  (and how much extra sugar too)\n\nSplenda brown sugar blend as it is, is a very coarsely granulated Splenda, a little coarser than Splenda white.  So the texture is better than what you might mix up on your own.  So for convenience, you can't beat Splenda brown sugar blend.  The Splenda brand is superior (in my opinion) to the store brands that are popping up but YMMV, and your store might have a really good version.\n\nStill...and this accounts for a very good four stars you can always count on Splenda, for texture, for flavor and consistency.  When you bake, that counts for a lot in my book.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['coffee', 'flavor', 'olive', 'oil', 'like', 'flour', 'good', 'fresh', 'much', 'sugar']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\n Kettle Brand Potato Chips, Sour Cream and Onion, 5 Ounce (Pack of 15)\" />\nReview:\nAfter looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.

It's got a lighter fruitier more acidic flavor when used in the drip coffee maker (one scoop per cup of coffee on the carafe ie. 8 cups on the side, 8 scoops in the filter) I'm liking it much better as a cold brew coffee, it's very smooth in the cold brew (but then most everything is). I won't be ordering it again, I'm going to try the dark roast, instead. But I got this very very inexpensively, so I'm not that disappointed, I just can't rate it higher for the price, when people want a review of the taste. :)\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\n Lavazza Tierra! 100% Sustainable Ground Coffee, 8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3) \nReview:\n1st cup down, second cup being enjoyed. My can says it expires 5/2011 - I have no idea how far out they set their best used by dates, so I've no idea how long this has been around. However, my first and second cup of coffee were flavorful and NOT bitter or sour. I paid next to nothing for this coffee and would again, but I wouldn't pay the nearly 8 dollars per can it is now when I paid a little more than that for 3 cans. It wasn't a knock your socks off, I can never drink another cup unless it's this cup of joe - but it's smooth, mellow, and enjoyable, especially when I paid next to nothing for it. If I'm going to pay nearly 8 bucks for a 1/2 pound, I'll go up to the local coffee roaster and get it fresh. (oh, normally I don't get my coffee in ground form, I usually grind it myself, but this was soooo inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.)\n\nSide note - this is an espresso grind. I had no trouble with it floating or clogging, but I sprinkled it with some cold water to wet the grinds a bit before I started the brewing, that helps keep them from floating up. I also propped open the little spring loaded cover to the coffee basket with a skewer so it was as open as it could get. Result was a clear coffee and no mess. Ratio - one level coffee scoop per cup as measured on the carafe.\n\nedit update 3/29/2011 - I've now had about 9 cans of this coffee - it's my go to coffee, it's still smooth mellow and enjoyable and I've given it an extra star for consistency, it's been good through all those cans, when ever it's on a decent sale (usually on the Friday Sale) I buy it again, just got another 3 cans. I also use it for the rub I put on ribeyes and a rub I made up to put on a pork butt for pulled pork...good stuff!  :)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Almonds, Bold Habanero BBQ, 16 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nOH MY WORD!! I love these, I love the bold flavored Blue Diamond almonds. Love this flavor first, then the wasabi then the salt vinegar. The Wasabi has a gram or so more of carbs, so I generally choose this one or the salt and vinegar. The problem for me is I'm an addict. If I got 3 pounds of these almonds, I'd eat 3 pounds of these almonds in short order. That being said. They are delicious, salty, a little spicy with a touch of sweeet - they are fantastic! This price is better than I get them at Wally World for the 6oz can and they are cheaper there than anywhere else. So, buy these, buy them now and hide the other bags from yourself (or send them to me) ...they are SO good, I'm eating them now! :\n\nHey Amazon, this is sold and shipped by you, it would be ever so nice if this came on the subscribe and save!\n\nNow that Wal-mart has lowered their prices on the 6oz cans - this amount in 6oz cans would cost 19 dollars and 84 cents 2.48 a can)- so, no savings, over buying them in store. A lot of time saved, however, to have them dropped off at your door.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Almonds  Bold  Wasabi &amp; Soy Sauce, Value Pack, 16-Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThey aren't quite as low carb as some of the other Bold flavors - but they are soooooo delicious...sometimes I forget to care! All of the Bold Flavors I've tried are fantastic. I already have a terrible addiction to crunchy nuts, pecans, macadamias, almonds, brazil...come to mama!

I don't keep milk in the house. Well, I thought I'd try the sugar free concentrate as a quicker way to fix the tea, bought some milk and BLECH...it was so sweet I had to dump it. And it was not spicy. I love the Lipton's it's rich and spicy and tastes like drinking Christmas...I want some right now! So, I cannot recommend this at all. If you want a very very mild flavored tea that's extremely sweet - this is your stuff - and I have some you can have! Come on by, it's yours! :D\n\nUPDATE 12/23/12 - now make my Chai from the Celestial Seasonings Chai - which blows the Lipton out of the water, in fact, I had forgotten I made it from Lipton till I reread my review.

I have rinsed them, boiled them and rinsed them again and had no problem with them, but the texture doesn't bother me, the kind of semi rubbery texture of pearl tapioca. Honestly, I really like them and hope I can find them for less. I used the \"rice\" the other day in a dish of sausage, onions and peppers with some asparagus all sauteed together, I rinsed the rice and then put them in the microwave and nuked them for 5 minutes, drained and rinsed them again and then dumped them in the sausage veggie mix, they soaked up the pan juices and were delicious. I've enjoyed the noodles in Asian style dishes and with spaghetti. I think I'll use the little \"rice\" balls in soup. I recommend these. I am only giving them 5 stars because they are obviously not pasta, but for what they are, they are great. :)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Royal Oak Gourmet Jumbo Virginia Salted Peanuts, 40-Ounce Holiday Christmas Tins (Pack of 2) \nReview:\nI have a serious nut addiction, granted peanuts aren't really nuts, but if they're crunchy and salty that's pretty much good enough for me. These are both crunchy and salty, they are big and you can see where the oil has bubbled on the surface of some of them. Some of them crunch with a soft crunch like a macadamia and then kind of melt and some of them CRACK and almost shatter in your mouth, some are just plain old peanutty and crunchy...the textures and taste and crunch crunch crunchy goodness make these a delight. Now are they way better than Planters or any other peanut, I honestly couldn't tell you, I don't buy peanuts. I'm generally low carb and eat other more low carb nuts, like pecans, macadamias, almonds, etc...but I bought these on a whim and now they are nearly gone. Five pounds of peanuts in a VERY short period of time, consumed in mass quantities, by the addict. Peanut crack. Buy some, buy them all, keep me from being able to order more...now, to buy some macadamias!\n\nUPDATE: I was going to order more but today on 9/12/13 these peanuts officially cost around 8 dollars more than when I bought them last, less than a year ago. HOLY SMOKES!! What is going on with Peanuts, or is it just Royal Oak, too bad, I was going to order more. :( I can't justify a rise in price of over 25% in less than a year.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Royal Oak Gourmet Virginia Cajun Spiced Peanuts, 10-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nThey are just the right mix of crunchy, salty and spicy.

I already have a problem with my love of practically all nuts (not so much cashews)so I really consumed these with abandon. If you have more self control than I do, I say, click that \"buy with one click\" and enjoy these wonderful crunchy delicious peanuts. ...think of me when you're saying \"man, she was right!\" ...because I'm waiting to order more till I feel a little more in control of the peanutty addiction...or not, I might try the crabby flavored ones! ....mmmm mmmm...

It's easy to brew, I throw 8 bags in a half gallon container - put it in the fridge and there it is in the morning. I know you can make it quicker (and I have) but I like the more intense blueberry flavor from letting it sit. My adult kids love it to. I gave this tea to everyone, I loved it so much I wanted to share, now I need to order more! :D  My daughter likes to throw a handful of frozen blueberries in her tea and, boy oh boy, is that great!

I bought this because of the price at the time and the fact it was much lower in sugar and carbs than peanut butter. That being said, it seemed sort of tasteless to me, I liked the texture, but it needs a little salt or something. I will still order it when it becomes available again because I put it in my low carb shakes, almonds butter and almond milk, some ice, some sugar free chocolate syrup...pretty tasty. Of course, my complaint about the saltiness is because I ate a lot of it right out of the jar...I told you I was an addict, if you don't do that, it might be just fine. :)\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'tea', 'love', 'one', 'oil', 'use', 'little', 'buy', 'right', 'taste']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nProgresso Solid Light Tuna in Olive Oil, 6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nI order the case because this is good stuff.

It's nutty, chewy and tastes good.  I don't even add salt.\n\nOne caveat is to let it cook for longer than the package calls for, and add a bit more water.

For two servings, I use 1/2 cup oats to 1 1/2 cups of water, bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat and cook for 30 minutes.  I usually add one T of brown sugar and a handful of dried blueberries, dried cranberries or raisins to the water before cooking.

Cook it in water or broth; add some sauteed onion and garlic or some ratatouille and it's a wonderful quick lunch.  Serve it as a bed for salmon or chicken and it's an equally delicious and fast dinner.\n\nBob's Red Mill Quinoa is my first experience with this ancient grain, and I'll be a fan for life.  Although I've read that quinoa should be washed before cooking to eliminate a bitter flavor, I've not had to do that with this brand.  It does have a bitey quality, but I happen to like it.

Without the almost-bitter notes of the Fogbuster, this Kona blend is complex, rich and delicious.\n\nFor a 12 cup drip coffeemaker, I use two and a quarter coffee scoops of the beans and grind for 15 seconds.

I love the combination of hazelnuts and dark chocolate, and the back off on sugar is exactly to my taste.  The dark grittiness of the cocoa comes through, the hazelnut gives it richness, and it's not overpoweringly sweet.\n\nBy no means is this stuff good for you!  A serving size is two tablespoons at 200 calories with half of those from fat.  Maybe it does have bumped up protein, but I still got sugar jitters from the spoonful I couldn't keep myself from devouring right out of the box it arrived in,  This won't be a breakfast spread for me, but I'm going in search of some coconut macaroons to serve as its vehicle for a totally decadent Sunday afternoon snack.\n\nI'm rating it in terms of its flavor, not for its implied healthiness.

They give dishes a dessert-y dimension I find unpleasant.  I've been searching for the perfect blend and this is it!  It's hot, curry-ish and delicious.  I've experimented with using it in salad dressing, chicken salad, and deviled eggs and it's the perfect blend for my taste.  There's no aftertaste and no funky cookie flavor.\n\nMy only quibble is the \"mild\" description.  This curry is quite spicy, and I love it.  Though it's branded as Authentic Indian Curry Powder, this would make a great base for Chinese, Japanese and Jamaican curries as well.\n\nSince my primary interest is flavor, I'm not that much concerned with organic spices, but I do appreciate that it's salt free, which makes it versatile.

I have no idea if it's authentic, but I don't care.\n\nI did preserve some lemons a month or so ago (the process took all of seven minutes), and I do think some of the deliciousness can be attributed to the addition of that lovely, lovely condiment, but this Frontier blend is almost, but not quite a curry, and is absolutely brilliant with slow cooked tagine dishes.

It's \"okay\" and we \"like it\" is the best we can say about the meatloaf. The mashed potatoes suck. I chuck those and make my own (Honest Earth instant is WAY better than this quickie mashie in this meal). I add a salad or sauteed veggies, and divide the two loaves: a meal for two pretty fast.\n\nI hate molding/dealing with raw meat, so when I get a meatloaf craving, I go to Boston Market or I keep this in the fridge. This 16 oz size is fine for two if you add sides. (Trust me, the mashed potatoes are not worth the calories, and you're better off making your own or baking a couple taters or just having some veggies and crusty bread on the side.)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nExplore Cuisine Fettuccini, Organic Edamame &amp; Mung Bean, 8 Oz (Pack Of 6)\nReview:\nFirst off, if you like a bit of an earthy taste to your noodles, this will work fine for you. If you are expecting it to be like wheat or rice or corn pasta--not so much.\n\nI liked the simplicity of ingredients (mung beans + water) and the very high fiber (11 grams per serving), plus lower carb and higher protein than regular grain pastas. I figured I'd take a risk. Know what? I like these.\n\nBecause some reviewers had used the term earthy--rightfully so--I boiled up a batch (raw vegans can just soak them for a day). I sauteed artichoke hearts and fresh mushrooms in EVOO and garlic, then just tossed in these noodles and added parmesan. Very nice. I enjoyed them a whole lot. I cooked them till they were al denter and I like the chewiness of the texture.  I will be trying these with pesto and red pepper sauce, too.\n\nA very pleasant surprise. I like em. I won't say they are like real pasta. They are simply a different sort of noodle for folks who enjoy that, and I do.\n\nIf you aren't sure if it's for you, just order ONE from some vendor. Don't buy this huge quantity.\n\nOh, you can eat these raw as a snack with a dip. My sister and I tried them raw before I cooked up some. We both agreed they were kinda interesting uncooked--crunchy. They might work fine for folks who can digest these okay raw.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSpecial K Crustless Quiche (Ham &amp; Cheese), 7 Oz (Frozen)\nReview:\nReally yummy. Smallish size, add toast and fruit or make a sandwich out of it. I sometimes, if tired, have this with sliced tomatoes and a fruit smoothie for dinner. I like this one a bit more than the portabella one, but I have to say the ease of this frozen breakfast item is terrific. A couple mins in the microwave and DONE. I hope they make more flavors. However, they really need to rethink the price. For how tiny these quiche \"patties\" are, five bucks plus for 2 of them is insane. I'd say these should cost in the neighborhood of 3.00 for the box, certainly no more than 4.00. $5.19 is a bit nuts and is the only impediment to my buying more quantities.\n\nUpdate: I've been making breakfast sandwiches for days with this (had to order more). Ezekiel bread, toasted, slice of cheese melted onto toast, one slice of Virginia ham. That's 8 grams of fiber for the sandwich,  about 400 cals, very filling and delicious.  (Tomato and fruit on the side). I gotta keep this one stocked.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLean Cuisine, Craveables, Margherita Pizza, 6 oz (Frozen)\nReview:\nIf it's a choice between no pizza or this lower calorie pizza: skip pizza.\n\nThe crust is gross. The toppings skimpy (as one expects in lower calorie). The flavor missing. This is a failure of a pizza.\nYou're better off buying pizza sauce with good flavor and low-fat cheese and getting a pita and making a pita pizza in the oven, adding toppings.\n\nTo make this one bearable I added garlic, mushrooms, and extra cheese. I also baked it a while in the oven to try and improve the crust. It helped marginally, but this pizza is so awful, that even with all those additions, it was unsatisfactory.\n\nNope. Can't recommend this.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nLean Cuisine Favorites Swedish Meatballs - Frozen Meal with 16g of Protein and No Artificial Flavors, Delicious Frozen Meal, Ready in Minutes (9.125 oz.)\nReview:\nThe meatballs are absolutely vile. I threw them out and just scooped out some of the noodles and sauce. The meat tastes horrible. I was thinking, \"Is this dog food? This can't be meatballs for humans!\"\n\nI do not get the good reviews. Unless I got the bad batch of all batches, this is some seriously nasty meat in them there meatballs. And the sauce was bland. Salty, but bland.\n\nWill never rebuy!!!\n\nPlease, Amazon Fresh, get some good frozen homestyle meatballs we can heat up at home. I've bought good beef and also chicken meatballs, frozen, at Whole Foods. You must have access now that you bought them out.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nBariWise High Protein Powder Hot Drink/Instant Low-Carb Cappuccino Mix (15g Protein) &ndash; Vanilla (7 Servings/Box) - Low Calorie, Low Carb, Low Fat, Aspartame Free\nReview:\nI saw all the good reviews, and I find the hot chocolate by Bariwise drinkable for a protein shot. So, I dediced to try this.\n\nOMG< sickeningly sweet and altogether gross. I can't drink this. I tried to guzzle it down, but I got to 1/2 the cup and just ditched it. I tried it in a cup of coffee, so see if real coffee mixed with it improved things. Um, no.\n\nNot something I ever want to drink again. I'm glad there are folks who find this yummy for protein ingestion. I'm not one of them.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nFrigo, Mozzarella Cheese, 16 oz\nReview:\nI've bought all sorts of mozarella-fresh, logs, etc. This one was odd. Incredibly dense and hard to cut and the flavor just didn't wow me. Did not like it. I like their parmesan, but I won't rebuy this one. The texture was weird.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nGolden Malted Pancake &amp; Waffle Flour, Original, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI'm a super lazy cook, and so I don't feel like making mixes from scratch. (I tried, and it didn't taste as good as this, anyhow.)  Although another reviewer complained about the vanilla \"fakey\" smell, we love it. I love how the house smells when I make these (or when we reheat frozen ones I make from this mix.)\n\nI like the flavor, even if it's kinda bland (other reviewers touched on this). The texture is nice. It freezes great for reheating through the week, so I make one big batch that covers several breakfasts for me and hubby.\n\nThis is a solid, good product, and I've ordered it more than once from amazon. Note that it will be good for about a year, so if you don't think you'll go through all these cans in that time, you may want to skip the amazon purchase and get one or two at a time. I find that three cans takes me fine through a year, as we don't eat waffles every day/week, and I don't use this for pancakes, as we like Heidi's Grainy Day for that. (Also available here at amazon).\n\nThumbs up.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNamaste Foods, Gluten Free Say Cheez Non-Dairy Macaroni &amp; Cheez Dinner 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI gave up gluten more than a year and a half ago. But I'm a girl who has always loved the pasta/cheese combo, and as a kid and adult, was one of those addicted to Kraft Mac n cheese, Amy's, any mac n cheese, really. :) I've been using gluten free Tinkyada pasta and just adding cheeses.\n\nI decided to try this, as it's dairy free. And it's fine. The pasta is fine. The spices packet is fine. And it makes a nice side dish. However, it's not mac-n-cheesy enough to satisfy that. Even having \"Cheez\" on the product name makes one expect cheeziness. Don't expect that and you'll be happier. :D\n\nWhat I will say is that the amount of oil they recommend ended up in a way too greasy outcome. I used coconut oil, and while the flavor was fine, I found it too oily, so cutting back is recommended for those who don't want greasy noodles.\n\nI'll also add that since this is mostly pasta and some spices, the price point is ridiculous, even with subscribe and save. Quite frankly, we'd be better off buying a good quality gluten free pasta and just mixing together the onion and paprika and other spices with oil and making our own. Yes, this makes it all-in-one convenient, but paying more than $4 bucks a bag for pasta and some spices kinda irks when it's not even organic.\n\nHowever, this is from a dedicated facility and definitely gluten free, and that's a plus.\n\nSo, as long as you think of this as a spiced pasta side dish, you should  be happy. If you want cheezy, then get some cheez item (like Daiya shreds) or cheese (the real stuff), and add it for cheezy/cheesy happiness. Or, really, just mix/make your own and save moolah.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\n Schr Gluten Free Penne, 12 oz. Box, 5-Pack \nReview:\nFor those of us who go GF (out of need or preference), this is a decent replacement choice for regular penne. Nothing is as good as regular pasta--the texture--but this is fine. I cook it a bit longer than they recommend, but as anything, do to your own taste.\n\nI also use the Tinkyada and that one's fine. If you don't want millet or corn, the Tinkyada is just made from brown rice. Some folks are sensitive to corn or have issues with millet.\n\nBut if you don't have sensitivities, this works fine in baked penne or regular boiled up with sauce. It's a small amount in the box for a higher than normal pasta price, but it seems everything GF costs more. I don't know why? Corn and rice are hardly race food commodities. Make me think GF folks are always getting slightly ripped off. But I like several Schar products, including this one.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['like', 'one', 'flavor', 'nice', 'good', 'really', 'try', 'taste', 'get', 'want']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nJOLLY RANCHER Chews Candy, Original, 6.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nBest candy ever and the store would think I was a maniac if I went and bought it there all at once.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

As a test, I did not tell my family it was made without wheat flour to see if they would notice.\n\nThe directions are simple and easy and I had it mixed up in a matter of minutes.  Into a muffin tin and baked for the amount of time specified on the packet and when i opened the oven, they looked perfect.  I pulled a couple out of the tin to serve my husband hot, with a dollop of butter and after he'd had them (a treat because I rarely bake), he stated that he could live on banana muffins and butter.  Only then did I tell him he flour is almond flour rather than wheat.  He had not been able to tell a difference and obviously, thoroughly enjoyed them.\n\nI have had them both hot and cold.

I had previously bought the Heidi's Cottage Cheese Pancake mix and we really enjoyed it (you use cottage cheese instead of milk/water to the mix) but in my review I commented that I wished it had whole grain instead of white flour in the mix, and I only gave that mix a 4.  When I saw this mix I was thrilled to see the whole grains and had to try it.  I use milk intead of water to mix it up (directions call for water) for extra flavor and nutrition.  I eat these without any syrup and my family agrees they are delicious pancakes.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKellogg's Special K Granola Bar, Dark Chocolate, 4.76-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI've enjoyed these but was surprised at how lightweight the box felt, and how small each bar is.  I prefer dark chocolate to milk but with the combination of flavors in the bars, I couldn't taste the dark chocolate per se.  Overall, they are a nice snack to have on hand to take to a ball game or on a car trip, but I certainly wouldn't replace a meal with them.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHorizon Organic Vanilla Milk, 8.0 Oz.

My daughter does not like and will not drink regular milk but she tried this and loves it.  Now she has one in her school lunch everyday and I feel good that she is getting the calcium/nutrition a young girl needs.  I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 because someone told me it has a little sugar in it.

It is refreshing to find a pancake mix that uses whole grains instead of processed flour, and that includes quality ingredients all the way through.  I would have to say I preferred the plain variety the best - I'm not much for flavored pancakes - but I feel I'm alone in this since the chocolate was the preferred mix with the kids.  And the blueberry was my husband's favorite.  Needless to say, we were all able to find a mix that we enjoyed.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nQuaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal, Cinnamon, 14.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nTasty, easy-to-eat, bite-size, cinnamon flavored cereal.

For starters, the ingredients are actually GOOD.  Although there are rather a lot of them, the first few are cornmeal, potato flakes and sunflower oil, followed by seasonings.  I can't complain about any of those.\n\nOn biting into the snacks they are very light and airy.  You can eat a lot of them without spoiling dinner (on the flip side, if you were eating them because you were hungry, they wouldn't fill you up very fast either).  The best part is since they are baked, they don't leave a lot of oily residue on the fingers.\n\nI personally didn't care for the shape of them.  They are roughly like a dehydrated version of a McDonalds French Fry and I would have preferred a different shape that wasn't so fiddly.  But I'm not deducting any stars for that since the taste and how good they are for you are the primary reasons I would buy them again.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeeled Snacks Organic Dried Fruit, Much-Ado-About-Mango, 1.4 Ounce (Pack of 10)\nReview:\nI read reviews prior to buying this so was expecting, I don't know, something \"more\".

(However, the \"flags\" say \"It's a boy/It's a girl\", so they may not be appropriate for other parties, but when you need chocolate, do you really care?)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKellogg's Nutri-Grain, Soft Baked Breakfast Bars, Assorted Pack, 1.3oz (48 count)\nReview:\nNutri-Grain cereal bars are tasty snacks that are not totally devoid of nutritional value. They consist of grains and fruit pures.\nThe package contains three flavors: Apple-cinnamon, Blueberry and Strawberry.\nThe bars are flavorful, but the texture is off-putting.. It's like a cookie baked with insufficient shortening; crumbles and falls apart; no body. Nice try Nutri-Grain, you got the filling right, now let's see what you can do with the shell...\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nDubble Bubble 380 Count Tub - Fruitastic Flavors, 3LBS 12.3 OZ (1.71 KG)\nReview:\nWhat ever happened to the bubble gum of old? If you expect to find it here, you will be disappointed.\nBubble gum used to be a penny a piece. The penny piece was also a decent sized piece.\nNow, the price has jumped and the size did shrink. This is not the same Dubble Bubble gum any more.\nThe flavor is nice, for a few seconds. Then, nothing. The pieces are also too small to blow bubbles. You need to chew two to three pieces to get a decent bubble.\nMaybe I should look for Bazooka Joe?

For a better hazelnut flavor coffee at a better price, try Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut coffee, also available here on Amazon in 5-pound bags.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nCoffee Bean Direct Hazelnut Flavored, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag\nReview:\nFinally, an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking.\nCoffee Bean Direct Hazelnut is a really smooth, medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor.\nThe flavoring is not sweetened, which is a real plus, especially if you don't like sweeteners in your coffee. (If you do, you have complete control yourself.)\nThe flavor is not overpowering, but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee.\nThose who have complained may have received a bad batch. Usually the blend is good and roasting consistant, but, as with any other food product, variations and accidents do happen.\nI have been using Coffee Bean Direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch.\nThis one is a winner.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWorld Kitchens Hot &amp; Spicy Beef Jerky, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nWorld Kitchens beef jerky is world class.

I can only say I am disappointed by the product and hope my experience may be an aberration.\n\nUnlike most of the commercially available products, the flavor of these preserves is excellent.  It is natural and does not taste as if the flavor was enhanced during processing.  However, the consistency of the preserves reminds me of rubber cement - it is gluey and does not spread easily.  Fortunately, I use a lot of preserves on each bagel piece, so this gave me an excuse to pile it on.  I thought it might be that the jar I purchased was getting toward the end of its shelf life, but it still had 15 months until the pull date.  Further, the jar I opened first had whole strawberries through it, rather than smaller pieces.  While this may be considered desirable, I like to be able to apread the preserves and not just glop on chunks of berry.\n\nI enjoyed the Cherry Preserves immensely, but I think there are all-natural strawberry preserve products on the market that are better than Bonne Maman Strawberry Preserves.  In fact, one of the big box stores has its own organic strawberry preserves available in a quart jar; these have the same outstanding flavor of the Bonne Maman, but are not rubbery and the strawberries have been crushed rather than processed as whole berries.  I believe the cost is about $7 for that product.\nRating:\n3.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Chocolate, all by itself is bitter.  And Stevia is super sweet and also bitter.  So the combination of these two ingredients creates an intense DARK CHOCOLATE that is very bitter-sweet.  Not a product for beginners, but very good for those who are accustomed to and appreciate the bitter notes of true chocolate and the super bittersweet flavor of stevia.\n\nChocolate has the potential to be a healthy superfood when it is consumed correctly - meaning that sugar and milk are not a part of the mix.  When chocolate candy is created, sugar and milk are added to tone down the bitterness of the chocolate.  But when people struggle with health issues, sugar is sometimes not an option, and often milk is also not an option.  Furthermore, milk negates the health benefits of chocolate.  According to the University of Michigan Health System, \"Milk binds to antioxidants in chocolate making them unavailable; therefore, milk chocolate is not a good antioxidant source.  To get the benefits of antioxidants, avoid drinking milk with dark chocolate.\"  (I would cite my source but Amazon doesn't allow links in their reviews.  Just google the terms, dairy and chocolate antioxidants, and the very first article should be the one I am referring to.)  In other words, to get the health benefits of chocolate, you must consume it without sugar and without dairy.\n\nI really like the simplicity of the Dante's ingredient list:  Chocolate Liqueur, Stevia, Pure Vanilla.  98% Cocoa.  And as a diabetic, I am in love with the fact that there is no sugar in the mix.  With this kind of list, the bitter taste is impossible to avoid.  So - if you hate bitter, then don't try this.  But if you like a simple, healthy, exotic and sophisticated dessert, then this might just be right up your alley.\n\nYou must also understand that this in not a low calorie food.  Even without sugar, there are still 260 calories per 45 gram bar AND 12 grams of carbohydrate.  Most of the calories in the Dante bar come from chocolate's high quality fat.  Compare to a Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate bar which is 190 calories per 41 gram bar and 25 grams of carbohydrate (the carbs are mostly from sugar).  This isn't about low calorie, low fat or low carb.  It is about the health benefits of pure chocolate and NO dairy or sugar - which is great news for diabetics who are open to new taste sensations.\n\nThis stevia sweetened chocolate is SO intense that you might not be able to eat more than one tiny square at a time.  This is where you will save on calories, fat and carbs - this chocolate is so satisfying that you will eat less and your cravings will be satisfied to the extent that binging will become a thing of the past.  Or if straight chocolate is too much for you, then you can grate it and sprinkle it on top of a whipped coconut cream mousse for a touch of chocolatey flavor without the dairy and sugar.  There are lots of things you can do with this, but be aware that this will NEVER taste anything remotely like a Hershey's candy bar.  Do not buy this thinking you will be able to make that switch because the two do not really compare.  It is better to realize that the bitterness inherent in both the chocolate and the stevia is to be appreciated and not avoided.  If you can come to terms with that, you might end up being one of those people who LOVE Dante's Stevia Chocolate.  If not, you will hate it.\n\nSo - I am giving the 4 stars - deducting one star because I was unable to confirm that the chocolate used is organic and non-GMO.  But for a simple, nutrient rich, sugar free chocolate rush - I think the Dante is wonderful!  However I am a long time Stevia user and am used to the taste of stevia.

It might have been in some of the delicious food, but since I never cooked while I was there, I am not sure if I ate it during my stay or not.  I probably did and never knew it, but since I don't know, I cannot compare what I tasted there to this product.\n\nI think this tastes akin to a very strong olive oil.  I prefer a lighter tasting oil, but I cannot say that this strong taste indicates a rancid flavor or if it is simply how Argan oil is supposed to taste.  I suspect that it's supposed to taste like this - I know what a rancid oil is like and this doesn't taste rancid to me.  Just really, REALLY strong.  When you put it in a dish, be sure to know that the flavor will overpower everything else.  I do have some real experience with exceptionally good quality extra virgin olive oil, and in my experience, the best olive oils do not have this intense,  unpleasant flavor.\n\nThis product gets 4 stars from me because of the vitamin E content.  I bought this because I am allergic to wheat and since wheat is a major source of vitamin E in the American diet, my levels were getting low.  Then I found out that Argan oil is even richer in vitamin E than wheat and my problem was solved.  Since I don't like the taste in cooking, I just take a teaspoon every day along with my disgusting cod liver oil and other supplements.  It does the trick.\n\nJust to make sure I have a really fresh Argan oil, I am planning to buy a different brand next time so I will have a basis for comparison.  If I find that Argan oil is always this strong in flavor, I'll come back and give this item 5 stars instead of 4.  If I find that I like other brands better, I come back and reduce my rating to 3 stars.  If I realize that this Argan oil is rancid, I'll come back and change my 4 stars to 1 star.  I might even take it to a local Moroccan restaurant and ask the owners to taste test it and give me a knowledgable opinion.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNative Forest Organic Premium Coconut Cream, Unsweetened, 5.4 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nUPDATE - June 4, 2017:  Since writing the above review, I have discovered that Thai Kitchen has some questionable additives and I have switched to Natural Value Coconut Milk.

It was supposed to be CREAM for goodness sake, but when I opened this can there was hardly any cream in the can.  The contents were grayish and watery.  There wasn't enough cream in this to make it worth anything.  I would rather buy Thai Kitchen coconut milk, which is pure white, FULL OF CREAM, and a rich milky water that is great for smoothies or soups.\n\nI am not sure how they define CREAM, but I feel like I got mostly water from this can.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nMiracle Noodle Shirataki Zero Carb, Gluten Free Fettuccini, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nA quick look at the reviews of this product shows that people are divided as to whether this is a guilt free pasta dream come true or whether this is a nasty, smelly, slimy nightmare.  And I fall solidly into the \"Dream Come True\" camp.\n\nAs a person with miltiple food allergies and type 2 diabetes, my diet had become a bland, monotinous string of meat and vegetables.  I don't like \"fake\" food and so I had opted out of substitutes like fake cheese, low carb bread, and artificial sweeteners.  Then I ran across these noodles (my doctor carries a line of low carb foods in his office), and decided that I would try them once, even if I probably wouldn't ever want to eat them again.\n\nI am really glad I tried them.  I like the texture, and the taste is so bland that they quickly soak up any flavor that is cooked into them.  The initial odor coming out of the package is kind of \"fishy\", but that goes away quickly as the noodles are prepared and they absorb the flavors and aromas of the foods they are cooked with.  The texture is slippery, stretchy, and chewy - kind of like I remember real pasta being.  Some reviewers said that they didn't like the \"slimy\" texture, but I didn't find it to be any slimier than real pasta.  In any case, it didn't bother me at all\n\nI started with spaghetti and meatballs, then I had buttered noodles, and then I had noodles with taco meat and a yummy mexican sauce with olives and avacado.  Then there was my allergen free version of Pad Thai.  The list goes on and on and I have never failed to love whatever I have used them in.  AND my blood sugar stays within the normal range!\n\nI tried several shape varieties, and I like the fettuccini noodles the best for pasta because they have substance.  I like the shiratake rice as a rice substitute.  I used the \"fake rice\" for a stuffed zucchini dish that was to die for - my whole family dove in and raved for more!  Shiratake noodles are now a part of my diet and long term lifestyle, and I have enrolled in the Subscribe and Save program because I use them so often.\n\nShiratake noodles are something a person either loves or hates, and there doesn't seem to be much in between, so I recommend that anyone who isn't sure and wants to try it once should buy from the Miracle Noodle website because they accept returns if you don't like the product.  If you like them, you can then purchase from Amazon, but first time users should buy directly from the manufacturer.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSimple Mills Almond Flour Mix, Artisan Bread, Naturally Gluten Free, 10.4 oz, 3 count\nReview:\nThis is absolutely THE VERY BEST paleo bread I have ever tried.\n\nFor a diabetic who chooses to address this disease with a paleo lifestyle, the nutritional content is flawless. Only 100 calories and 11 grams of carbs per serving, with 5 grams of protein and 6 grams of \"good fat\". It is gluten free, soy free, grain free, dairy free and low carb. And for Paleo People who do not fear fat, this is a dream come true.\n\nBut the nutrition facts don't mean a thing if it isn't tasty and satisfying, and that is where this product really shines. It is so yummy that I cannot believe it is made up of short, simple list of ingredients that fully comply with the demanding restrictions of \"paleo\". The secret ingredient is Apple Cider Vinegar, which is added to the mix along with eggs and oil. This gives Artisan Bread a distinct flavor of old fashioned sourdough bread. I love, love, love it!\n\nWhat is more, this bread actually competes with mainstream, grain based bread enough to interest my husband who is not Paleo and has no health issues that would require him to restrict his diet. He absolutely raves about this and I end up making it quite often because it gets eaten pretty fast around our house.\n\nI have type 2 diabetes, Celiac Disease, and numerous food sensitivities, and I know the frustration of a restricted diet that leaves me feeling unsatisfied. Finding something that falls well within the parameters of my dietary demands, that doesn't make me sick and that is also yummy and filling is a real find. I'll never be without this again!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nZOT 100% Organic Licorice with Mint, 0.4-Ounce Flip Top Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nNot everyone's cup of tea, but I love them.  The mint is very detectable, and blends well with the strong licorice taste.  If your taste buds are attuned to offbeat flavors, then you might like this.  People who want CANDY might not enjoy this as much as I do.  THERE ARE NO ARTIFICIAL OR NATURAL SWEETNERS - just the taste of pure mint and licorice.\n\nAnother thing I like about this product is that it makes a really effective cough suppressant.  Since I am diabetic and suffer from frequent colds, this takes the place of sugary cough drops that ultimately leave me sicker.  I have a large supply for this purpose, because it is the only losenge that relieves a cough without the added problems of sugar or artificial sweeteners.\n\nOne note about the price:  I purchased this item because it was cheaper than a similar product by Zagarese Licorice, but when it arrived, I realized that these little boxes are about 1/2 the size of the Zagarese Licorice.  Zagarese is a better bargain, and is almost exactly the same product.  It was my own fault for not closely reading the ads, but an unpleasant surprise all the same.  Next time I will buy Zagarese (which is also available on Amazon)!  Zagarese is very similar to Zot, but one difference is that Zot has a stronger mint taste.  Otherwise, they are almost exactly the same.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Rapunzel Pure Vegan Vegetable Bouillon, No Salt Added, 8 Cubes, 2.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nAwesome, healthy convenience food that is a great base for so many dishes.

We normally buy the standard Gatorade mix from the grocery store, but were intrigued with the new carb-recovery drink.  So, he put it to the test.  For flavor, he states that this drink tastes pretty similar to the original orange, which is refreshing.  Those who like standard Gatorade may find this a little on the overly-sweet side, as it is higher in carbs and sweetness than the \"original\" drink.  For flavor alone, that was our only caution and the reason for withholding 1 star.  However, after one particularly difficult workout (a long, sweat-soaked round of shoveling after a PA snow storm) he thought that the flavor and sweetness were fine.\nHis personal recommendation was that this drink did a better job than the standard Gatorade of getting him back on his feet hydration-wise.  We have often found that after a grueling workout he battles dehydration for the rest of the day, which also leads to exhaustion.  In my years as a personal trainer, I have learned that the body maintains hydration best when it is accompied by a moderate dose of carbs because it helps the water stay in the body longer, thus making it more available to recovering muscles.  Generally speaking, he felt that his total recovery from the workout was significantly faster and better than with the standard sports drink, and the flavor is good if you're not taking anything else sweet at the same time.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I was going by positive amazon reveiws and though this would not only make preparing dinner faster but give us a different taste from my same ole, same ole. Well it sure did. I don't like the taste of the chicken broth. If you're familiar with Orrington's chicken base, that's what it taste very similar to; kind of like an artificial butter taste.  The pasta itself is good, stayed nice and firm but the broth used to make the sauce to me was a bit off putting.

I've been drinking P G Tips since my first trip to England back in the 1980's but have often had trouble finding a source for purchasing it here.  I got it from British food importers for many years, then my local grocery stores began to stock it.  Except they don't always have it on the shelf and I often have to visit several stores to find it.  Amazon has definitely solved that problem for me.\n\nI really enjoy drinking this particular tea.  It is a very mild tea, without the harsh flavor some other black teas can have.  Since I make at least two pots of tea each day (and sometimes more) this lovely large quantity will come in very handy and keep my pantry stocked for a long time to come.  It was also much cheaper to buy in this larger size than the 40 count boxes I find in my stores, plus no sales tax and the additional savings of the Amazon Prime membership came in very handy with eliminating the shipping charges.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It is versatile; depending on how you season it depends on how it turns out.  For example, it can be seasoned with lemon, pepper, garlic, basil, etc.  It can also be seasoned with brown sugar.\n\nI am not going to write a long review; the grain itself is versatile enough to make it just about any way you want.  And it's easy to prepare.  And it's healthful (I'll get into that in the next paragraph).\n\nFrom what I'd heard about the grain, it is \"old\", \"strong\", \"healthy, \"wise\" (even has built up a coating that is a resistance to insects).  This grain intrigues me; I plan to look up its history.\n\nQuinoa (which I recently found out) is what dieticians call a \"complete protein\".  Other than meat products, there aren't a lot of \"complete proteins\" that I know of, other than soy.  I do not eat soy.  So I thought I'd give this product a try.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLipton Black Iced Tea Bags, Cold Brew Decaffeinated Family Size,22 Count,4.8 Oz (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThis tea is perfect for me, especially since I don't boil my tea, anyway.  I just let it seep out of the bags into the water.  I put the bags in the gallon jugs, and let it set there in the refridgerator.  And I love the taste of this tea.\n\nI do usually drink decaffeinated tea, as the caffeinated versions keep me up really late.  I wish I had of known about this back in the day when I had to pull all-night duty.  Back then, I did not know that caffienated tea did this to me.  I tried coffee to keep me perky all night, but it did nothing for me.\n\nI love tea.  This particular type of tea tastes really good to me.  And I love cornbread and iced tea.  That is a combination that goes good together for some reason.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Natural Oven Roasted Almonds Vanilla Bean, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese nuts are heavenly in more ways than one.  For one, all nuts are healthy.  Almonds are especially heathful.  For two, the taste is out of this world.  It is an almond taste with a smooth vanilla background.  If you like both almonds and vanilla, then you will be in heaven.\n\nLucky for me, I am a nut lover.  I am lucky to love something so healthy.  And the vanilla background of these nuts make them a very healthy and tasty snack; they are so good, it is hard to believe that they are healthy.\n\nAlmonds are good for the heart, as well as other organs.  Even though raw nuts, I'm sure, are healthier than cooked nuts, I do sometimes include nuts in different recipes.  However, I would never include these vanilla almonds in any recipe, because I would be afraid that the vanilla might come off.  I only eat these raw.\n\nThis is a very healthy snack.  Highly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLate July Organic Dark Chocolate Sandwich Cookies,  8.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI was attracted to this box of cookies because of the \"brand\". \"Late July\" sounds like a wonderful brand name, and late July does bring back wonderful memories for me: it sounds like a fish fry with homemade french-fried potatoes and cole slaw and hush puppies, an ice bucket, iced tea, a cool breeze blowing from the fan, a porch, and lots of love. That's what I thought of when I saw this brand. Also, it is natural and therefore, vegans can have this product.\n\nVanilla bean with green tea:  The cookies didn't taste good. The flavor idea was pretty good. There was a hint of good flavor. Vanilla bean with green tea sounds wonderful. Possibly, the bad taste was due to all the soy and soy products used.  I managed to eat this whole box (of vanilla bean with green tea) without throwing any out.\n\nDark chocolate:  Horrible.  I couldn't even finish the whole box; I had to throw out most of it.  (And I'm the queen of conservativeness.)  The \"dark\" chocolate was so dark and so horrible, that it was too much for even a chocolate lover.  The chocolate had a horrible taste.  Not to mention the horrible taste it left in your mouth.  (Possibly too much soy, and whatever was in that chocolate.)  I literally had to go and buy some lemons and ate two, and also some potato chips, just to get that taste out of my mouth.\n\nNever again.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\ngoodnessKNOWS Cranberry, Almond &amp; Dark Chocolate Gluten Free Snack Square Bars 18-Count Box\nReview:\nOne star is missing:\n\n1- Soy lecithin is listed in the ingredients.\n\n2- Milkfat is listed in the ingredients.\n\nThe bars aren't all bad:\n\n1- There are several good ingredients, such as berries, almonds, honey.\n\n2- They taste good.\n\n3- Each \"bar\" is divided into four squares.\n\n4- They are non-GMO.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Sweet Leaf Tea Lemon &amp; Lime Unsweetened Tea Bottle ( 12x16 OZ)\nReview:\nSweet Leaf Tea Lemon & Lime Unsweetened Tea.\n\nI love Sweet Leaf brand tea.

I am also a granny and I love it.\n\nNormally, I drink my tea unsweetened.  Very rarely do I drink my tea sweetened.  But i do drink the sweet varieties of Sweet Leaf (that is the exception for me).\n\nThis particular variety that I am reviewing is unsweetened, so this is my favorite variety.  It has lemon and lime flavor, which I love.\n\nSweet tea is just too sticky for me, even though I do drink sweet Sweet Leaf teas as an exception.  But even too many of those can get too sticky.  That's why this particular variety (Lemon & Lime Unsweetened) is my favorite variety.

Who doesn't like chocolate?  The chocolate is so scrumptious.  Feels so good in your mouth.  It is the best chocolate I've had in a while.\n\nNow I will talk about the blueberries.  I love blueberries so much.  They are so delightful, so pleasant.  I could eat blueberries all day.\n\nNow we will put the two (chocolate and blueberries) and talk about this product.  This product is the most ambrosial food I have had in I don't know how long.  Yes, they are yummy, but that word is not delicate enough for this product.  Delectable is a better choice.  I just cannot say how exquisite, delicious, enjoyable these chocolate-covered blueberries are.  Heavenly:  maybe that's a better and stronger word to describe them.\n\nNow we will talk about the packaging.  This particular package is:  8 individual packs in each bag, and 8 bags.  Since they are individual, you can take a pack for lunch.\n\nI know my review wasn't nearly good enough to explain and describe how good this product is.  There are just no words and no way to let anyone know.  This is the best food I've had in I don't know how long.  I hope you will try these chocolate-covered blueberries.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCommunity Coffee Whole Bean Coffee, French Roast, (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nCommunity Coffee Whole Bean Coffee, French Roast.

If you love the smell of coffee, this would be something that you would love to wake up to every morning.  And if you love the taste of coffee, this coffee, I think, would be perfect.\n\nThese are whole beans, so you have to grind them yourself.\n\nIf you're hooked on coffee, or if you like coffee, I highly recommend this product.\n\nI love coffee.  I love the smell of it.  And I'm pretty much hooked on it.  Not so much to where I will go into convulsions if I don't get it, but it is uncomfortable without it.

There are lots of good recipes in which you can make things out of coffee.  I love the flavor, the taste, and the smell of coffee; therefore, I love not only coffee as a drink, but also as an ingredient in certain recipes.\n\nThis product is superb.

I stopped eating oatmeal as soon as I finished all of the packets in the box. I just did not like it.\n\nLast month, Consumer Reports rated Quaker Steel Cut Oats the top choice, so I began contemplating trying those (for whatever reason, they did not rate McCann's Steel Cut Oats). When I saw these on sale, I decided to try them, fearing that six 16-ounce boxes is a lot if I do not like them, but I am glad that I did. McCann's Steel Cut oatmeal is very tasty and I like the texture a lot. You cannot even compare this to instant oatmeal.\n\nI cooked mine in the programmable coffee maker. Before going to bed I put 1/2 cup of oats and a pinch of salt in the carafe, added water per cooking instructions on the box to the coffee maker's reservoir, and set the timer to start brewing the next day 30 minutes before I usually have breakfast. It all worked perfectly. I just scooped it out of the carafe into a bowl, added some blueberry preserves, and had a great breakfast.\n\nI would definitely recommend this product.\nRating:\n5.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Much better than the homogenous blend I used to get @ Costco that ended up rubbery, like sponges and had to be cut into tiny pieces to get better texture. I used this for chicken soup with risotto and the variety made the dish marvelous with different colors and textures. Nothing was rubbery. This works so much better for me than buying white & brown fresh mushrooms that often end up getting pitched for not being cooked fast enough; so these save me money in the long term. I keep these in a large glass canister with a screw top gasket lid, in the pantry. They would also look cool on display; but I would keep them out of direct sunlight. The black ones DO get large, so you might want to break these up into smaller pieces and use less per dish, but I happened to like those.

I've been a fan of these (as I'm also a fan of jellybeans and Turkish Delight--all in the same lineage) for decades. Now they've come out with Cranberry-Applets, which I guess I missed; however, they're tasty, too!

But they are so much work, I swore this year I'd try a commercially made one.\n\nThis is the first such one I've ever had and will undoubtedly try another high-rated dark fruitcake.\n\nThis one uses real, sweet, candied orange peel, and when you heat up a little slice before eating, it's quite good!\n\nNext I'm going to try a few sprinkles of brandy on top to give it an even-more homemade flavor.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nV8 V-Fusion Smoothie, Strawberry Banana, 36 Fl Oz (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nA couple of glasses of this a day and I've lost about 10 pounds in two months.

I believe they sell them with pistachios, but those aren't very good. It's easy enough to grab a couple of walnut halves with a piece of the candy and eat them together; the pieces are small enough to do that. Very tasty!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTwinings of London Prince of Wales Loose Tea Tins, 3.53 Ounces (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThere isn't any advantage to buying in bulk when the tea you buy is stale and bitter from the first time the can is opened.

However, this tea is either dry or I got a strange batch because it becomes quite bitter very quickly. The sweet, floral jasmine flavor is present but again--with a bitter tinge.

Most product descriptions don't tell the truth.\n\nPros: I was pleasantly surprised at the taste of this tea. DON'T OVER BREW or it will be bitter! JUST 2 minutes is perfect. I can get three pots out of this tea but I let the last pot sit at least 10 minutes. I've ordered a second time and will order this again. This is now my daily tea.\n\nHowever...\n\nCons: I read that if you gently press the little balls of rolled \"Gunpowder\" tea, they should give and be pliable. This is the sign of fresh tea. This tea crumbles, a sure sign of older tea, stored who-knows-how-long. I would like to get a fresh shipment but I also like the reasonable price of this old tea. I guess that is the trade-off. If someone knows where I can get fresher \"Gunpowder\" tea at a good price, please let me know.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I just prepared the recipe for Pappa Al Pomorodo (Tomato Soup) found on the Carmelina website and it was like being back in Italy. When I poured the product out of the can, I could see and smeall the difference. The tomatoes were in a thick red puree and the soup quickly came together because these tomatoes do not have chemicals to keep them firm.  These tomatoes are so good, that I returned to Amazon and got on the autoship list.

Bag\nReview:\nI'm a committed low-carber since that's the only food style that lets me lose weight and feel good. Chia seeds are the magic potion: sprinkle several tablespoons on a daily salad, a tablespoon in some eggs before scrambling, more on steamed cabbage -- they're small like poppy seeds and add a nice crunch on the way to your stomach where they'll expand and keep you feeling full longer. They also help move food through your system so that constipation is never a problem. Try them!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNavitas Organics Chia Seed Powder, 8 oz. Bag\nReview:\nThese may last forever at 1T every day in my morning shake since I'm having trouble finding recipes for other ways to use these seeds, but they will keep (in a sealed plastic container).\nUPDATE: Figured out the best use of these seeds for ME--I love salad with 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds and am now adding 2 tablespoons chia seeds, too. This way I get lots of crunch, different textures and a REALLY filling meal. I've been eating very low-carb (20 grams or less/day) for about 9 months now and have lost 30 lbs. But, at that low level of carbs, even using them all on vegetables and drinking jugs and jugs of water can still leave a constipation problem. These seeds fixed that immediately even as they facilitated eating less and feeling more satisfied. Miracle food is REAL.

We found the grind was course and uneven. We found the coffee completely dry (freshly ground coffee has indices of moisure being present when fresh and then ground). The uneven grind would mean uneven results, and we like to grind our own using a burr grinder which not only gives a consistent granularity; it does it without overheating (recooking) the bean as some grinding processes do. We have no way of knowing, but we think it was old. So it wasn't to our liking, we thru out 2 new bags and the partrtial we had opened. My wife correctly told me the least I could have done was send it to the local food bank. I have nothing against the seller, make sure you order the right product, and have some understanding of it's shelf life and age between you and the seller and you'll be fine.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nKirkland Saigon Cinnamon 10.7 Oz Bottles( Pack of 2) - 21.4 Oz Total\nReview:\nWe are using this off the shelf product as a medicinal aid (dietary supplement is the means) in treatment of Type 2 diabetes.

They arrived undamaged.  If I had anything to say on the very slight down side it would be that these are about 85% of the size I normally get in a restaurant, so slightly smaller and at this price you can just grab a second one if you need it.  As for the fortune, it's typical of what is given out these days. I used math and logic in my working life and the notion that one slip of paper can deliver a unique verbal prediction for you and a winning lottery number just can't travel together (if you hold any store in those fortune slips anyway).  The two diverse things on the slip are contradictory, if one's correct the other one can't be correct, but it's all in fun so why take a fortune cookie serious? So I withheld one star because of the slightly smaller size.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPeanut Butter Bars Candy 5LB Bag by Atkinson\nReview:\nWhat's not to like?

I haven't seen a pure strawberry product except the Kerns juice they used to produce and market in soda type cans. Whenever you see any juice-based product look at the detail because by volume apple-juice is usually the largest contributor no matter what the flavor says. Apple juice is prominent in all but POM Brand (pomegranate juice) and even they now have a looks like bottle that's mostly other juices by volume and a really expensive bottle that's still pure pomegranate. Anyone that's ever had a fresh pomegranate can appreciate how many of those seed is takes to produce an ounce of pure juice.

I've added it to my low carb cheesecake, brownies, smoothies, shakes. If your recipe already calls for sugar substitute and chocolate, A small amount of SweetLeaf Chocolate will punch up both the richness of the chocolate and the sweetness of the sugar substitute. Try a few drops in a glass of milk for a chocolate milk that tastes so much better than the sugar-free version of the big-name syrup. If you like your chocolate milk rich with a nice chocolate color, here's a tip: stir a half teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa with a few drops of SweetLeaf Chocolate into 12 oz of cold milk. The cocoa won't mix with the milk very well, but if you put the milk in the fridge for 20 minutes, the cocoa will become saturated and will then stir into the milk with a spoon just like the syrup! Bob's your uncle!\n\nThis is a very authentic chocolate flavor that is actually complimented somewhat by the slight bitterness of the stevia, giving it the depth of dark chocolate. I cannot wait to make no sugar chocolate whipped cream in my cream gun!\n\nNow I'm going to have to try a few more flavors!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKeebler&nbsp;Cookies, Simply Made,&nbsp;Chocolate Chip, 10 oz Tray\nReview:\nYes, Keebler! Please keep making products like this! I stopped buying and eating \"store-bought\" cookies years ago because of the horrible ingredients - partially hydrogenated vegetable fats, artificial vanillin, etc. Simply Made chocolate chip cookies have a delightful flavor. They're rich and buttery with a delicately crispy texture, not hard and dry like most other store-bought cookies. The chocolate chips are plentiful and decent quality. They melt in the mouth like they should instead of being hard little burnt bits. The chocolate chips are pretty high in cocoa percentage, so they are strong-flavored with a slightly roasted aftertaste. If you're used to the anemic, overly-sweet, vanillin-flavored chocolate bits in other store-bought chocolate chip cookies, these may taste a bit different to you.\n\nWhile they're not exactly \"home made\" tasting, they are far and away the best store-bought cookies I've had in a very long time. I wish I could give Keebler extra stars for making baked goods with wholesome ingredients (real sugar, real butter, coconut oil) instead of corn sweeteners and partially hydrogenated fats.\n\nEdit: I think the \"burnt\" taste people are commenting on might be just the browning. Real butter will take on a slightly nutty taste (beurre noisette). It's a unique flavor but a sign that real butter is being used. Many people prefer this taste to the flavorless, greasy shortenings normally used in store-bought cookies. Additionally, since they use real sugar instead of fructose corn syrup, browning occurs at a different temp, which may add to the complexity of flavors of baked goods.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMadelaine Chocolates Easter Eggs - Traditional Easter Basket Mainstays - Solid Premium Milk Chocolate Eggs Foiled In A Variety Of Solid and Floral Colors - 1 LB\nReview:\nThese chocolate eggs are exceptional quality with a rich, creamy, silky melt on the tongue, and a nice snap to the bite.

I tried some before and liked them, but these new ones now have a texture that I find rather unpleasant. Instead of bits of nuts, they now contain bits of a gritty substance that doesn't suit the overall texture. The gritty bits seem out of place and give the impression that the ingredients weren't thoroughly mixed. Additionally, they now give me the worst gas I've ever had in my life. Usually after a few weeks of eating food with bulk, my body is able to adjust and settle down. Not so with these. So, not recommended for road trips or for breakfasts before important meetings! Don't say I didn't warn ya!\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nGlucerna Hunger Smart, Diabetes Nutritional Shake, To Help Manage Blood Sugar, Rich Chocolate, 10 fl oz, 12 Count\nReview:\nThese would be 100x more awesome if they used real vanilla flavoring instead of vanillin or just had a plain cream flavor you could add your own flavoring to. 1 in 3 people can taste the difference vanilla vs vanillin, and most people dislike the artificial aftertaste of vanillin.

We have lived in Italy for long periods and find this coffee v statisfying.\nRating:\n4.0\n</Other Writer-1>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I've tried several other brands of fruit punch and this one tastes the best, I can add it to my lunch without worrying about added sugars. The small boxes are perfect for on the go and the packaging is very convenient, I can easily throw a few in my bag. The taste is a little sweeter than I expected but it's still very refreshing, I think it's a great alternative to soda.", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an Amazon customer that likes to write reviews for products.

Perfect for children's small hands and stomachs, but too small to quench the hunger of an adult.\n\nI enjoyed the combination of berries and applesauce, but was a little put-off by its ultra fine texture. It reminded me of baby food. But I can see why they have it that way, seeing as how the neck of the pouch is very small - they don't want it to clog. The screw top lid is a nice touch, kids can eat part and throw the rest in their lunch box without fear that it will spill.\n\nI think kids will like the idea of squeezing it out like toothpaste.\n\nA tip for parents: The first pack opened very easily for me, but the second one didn't. It was a struggle to snap it free. With this in mind, you might want to go ahead and loosen the caps if you put this in lunch boxes for small kids.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSwiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix, Sensible Sweets, Light, 8 count,0.29 ounce, (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nBut drinking a lot of milk and chocolate mixed with sugar has its negative health side. During the winter I like hot drinks and the Swiss Miss diet drink is very satisfying. I can taste the sucralose (substitute for sugar) and that is a slight reduction in enjoyment. Also I notice the thinness of the drink compared to regular milk. So I rate it 4-4.5 stars.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBarilla Whole Grain Spaghetti, 13.25 oz(Pack of 10)\nReview:\nLike a lot of people I have to limit my intake of white flour. The wheat version of this spaghetti is more healthy for me and I don't notice a taste difference from the white flour version. I like the higher fiber content and add this product to dishes with a lot of liquid to fill me up.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S Kisses Chocolate Candy, Birthday Blue, 7 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThe latest fad seems to be foil colors and different sizes. Your mouth doesnt care- it still tastes the same. I rate the product not the exorbitant price for different packaging. Sales marketers have to justify their gimmicks (read their jobs) with new packaging because they don't want to mess with a product that cant be improved.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLipton Green Tea Bags, Decaffeinated Blackberry Pomegranate, 20 ct, Pack of 6\nReview:\nI enjoy having a cup of tea in mid-afternoon as a pick-me-up. I drink my regular tea and Chinese tea straight. I've enjoyed sampling these Lipton fruit flavored teas. The flavor is more pronounced when I steep it for several minutes with a little honey added. The blackberry really was distinct in this tea. Lipton should take the pomegranate name off and just make a pure pomegranate tea. I know I would like that flavor.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nQuaker Instant Oatmeal Original, 12 Packets per Box (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis cereal has a nice apple flavor. Its plenty sweet too. I like to add some plain oatmeal to the bowl to create more volume to fill me up and make it less sweet. One of my tricks to keep it from overflowing the bowl in the microwave is to let it stand in the water for a couple of minutes while I prepare my coffee. The water absorbs into the oatmeal. I then put it into the microwave for about a minute and its hot.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nQuaker Oats Gluten Free Quick 1-Minute Oats, Original, Breakfast Cereal, 18 Ounce Canister (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI cant tell any taste, texture, or results with this gluten-free version that has changed from the old standard. So if its cheaper than the regular or 1-minute versions or you have a family member who is paranoid about ingesting gluten, by all means don't hesitate to buy this latest variation.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLipton Liquid Iced Black Tea Mix, Black Cherry Dragonfruit 2.43 oz\nReview:\nIve used several flavors of Lipton iced teas and they are more satisfying than soda. I drink less and am satisfied. Of course, Im also consuming less sugar or its substitutes.\n\nIm a big tea drinker- orange pekoe, green, oolong, etc. I taste a little tang from the black tea but the lemon dominates. I like straight hot tea. But in the summer I want some flavor in iced tea. So while the Lipton doesnt really taste like straight iced tea, I am pleased with its refreshing flavor.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSeason Black Capelin Caviar from Iceland, 3.5-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI love salmon caviar and other expensive caviars with large eggs. This was a gamble that the taste would be good without the expense. I am well satisfied. The eggs are very small but a thin layer spread on top of cream cheese on a bagel was just right. To really get the flavor though, it is necessary to chew the eggs. Their smallness means you might just swish them in your mouth with your tongue and that won't impart the full flavor.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMadhava Naturally Sweet Organic Blue Agave Low-Glycemic Sweetener, Golden Light, 11.75 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nAgave Nectar is very similar to honey but sweeter. It does have a slight taste. I like that it does not solidify like honey and it is a great substitute for sugar as you use less. My nutritionist suggested rotating Agave, cane sugar, and honey to avoid some problems I was having and now I predominately use the Agave because I like it so much.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n-Most frequently used words of the writer is: ['flavor', 'like', 'taste', 'little', 'add', 'coffee', 'tea', 'use', 'used', 'cheese']\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n<Other Writer-1>\nProduct:\nEmperor's Kitchen Organic Black Sesame Seeds, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThese seeds are flavorful; I am so glad I bought four pounds of it!!!
