It is made with Blue Plate mayo, which I enjoy, and I enjoy Tabasco pepper sauce. But the pepper flavor in this mayo is not a good, and does not have the typical aroma nor flavor of cayenne. The \"heat\" is average. There is a strange after-taste that remains from this mayo. I am a regular user of foods with cayenne added, but there is some other, more prominent, flavor in this mayo that is not appealing.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nCento Petite Diced Tomatoes, 15 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nVery good flavor and aroma! I had never tried this brand before, but now I am very glad I decided to try it. Upon opening a can, the aroma is impressive, and the flavor is too. Very fresh-tasting tomatoes, excellent for addition into sauces, and other dishes. I made a bowl of Salmon salad, and added a few tablespoons of this product into it, and the result was delicious! Everybody who had some, commented on how good the flavor was.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Plate Real Mayonnaise, 30 Ounce Jar\nReview:\nThis is good mayo!

The fish itself is good (in the batch I received), but the label claims \"Net weight: 15 ounces\". The problem is that each can contains only about 9.33 ounces of fish; the rest is water, oil and fish particles suspended in the fluid. The fluid is approximately\n5.67 ounces by weight; 168mL fluid. After 4 hours time allowed for separation, the oil is about 11mL of the total. Hence, each can of \"Chicken of The Sea\" Chub Mackerel is only about 62 percent fish.\nThe measurements were based on the average of 10 cans. Deviation from the average was minimal. The ratio of fish-to-water is the worst of all canned fish I have seen. At 9.33 ounces of fish per can, the actual cost of the fish is approximately $0.268/ounce, far higher than it should be, making it more expensive per ounce than canned Salmon.\nAlso, all 10 cans were excessively dirty, half the cans were badly dented. Rubbing a paper towel around the rim revealed a mix of metal particles and dust/dirt. If you use this product, be sure to clean the can rim before using a can opener, else some of metal and/or dirt can get into the fish.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nMuir Glen Organic Tomato Sauce, No Sugar Added, 15 Ounce Can (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis is excellent tomato sauce! It is my first experience with it, but I know I will use this product again (and again!) in the future. I like that it has no harmful ingredients, and the flavor is superb -- very fresh aroma and flavor! If you do not have the time to do all the work of making your own sauce from your own tomatoes, this product is an excellent substitute.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Everyone likes them (or not).  They are a nice-sized snack in a nearly indestructible foil wrapper.  You get two double-length cookies, approximately equivalent to 4 regular Fig Newtons.  Good for tossing in lunches, purses, the car, etc.  Arrived very fresh and in good shape.  Handy as a somewhat more nutritious snack.

What can you say?  You either like it or you don't.  We do.  It's not exactly like homemade, but for a quick meal when you're in a hurry, it's okay.  The Hamburger Helper meal sizes are continuing to shrink.  These are a measly 6.6 ounces; about enough for one hungry person or two mildly hungry ones. I add a few extras--about 4 ounces of dry spaghetti noodles, a cup of additional water, some tomatoes and/or other veggies, to make a bigger meal.  Also, I quite often use ground Italian sausage, instead of hamburger, very tasty!  I look for these meals on sale, because at full price, they are just too expensive for what you get.  Hope this helps!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSweetLeaf Sweet Drops Liquid Stevia Sweetener, SteviaClear, 4 Ounce (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nI've used this product for quite a few years, after trying MANY other brands and forms, and still find this to be the absolute best stevia product--hands down!  I don't know what we would do without this product.  We use it every day, all day, for coffee, tea, sweetening yogurt fruit, etc.  All our family members like it, too.  One bottle lasts for over two months, usually three.  It has no aftertaste, a few drops is all it takes and finally, we've been able to almost eliminate sugars from our diet without \"suffering\".  There are 2,880 drops in a 4 oz or 120ml bottle, according to the manufacturer.  We love it!\nUPDATE:  Received new shipment and bottle label has changed.  Now states there are approx. 600 servings per bottle at 5-8 drops per serving or to taste.  Last few bottles seemed slightly weaker, but still the best of all the other brands, by far.  We still love it!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nALTOIDS Classic Wintergreen Breath Mints, 1.76-Ounce Tin (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nWe love these Wintergreen Altoids! While they are a very good breath mint, we use them mainly for flavoring our coffee and sometimes, tea. One, in the bottom of the cup, or a few in the coffee/tea pot makes life more interesting! Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee. And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too. Very inexpensive, easy way to flavor coffee or tea, much cheaper than alternative. Almost no calories, but big on flavor! We've used these for decades!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRoland Coconut Milk, Lite, 14 Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nWe see why people like this brand of coconut milk.  We like it, too.  It is organic and does have guar gum (which is a food derived, natural ingredient), but it DOES NOT have chemicals/preservatives, which are bad for you.  It is thick and creamy when slightly warmed, has a strong coconut flavor and tastes better than the brands with added preservatives.  (We've tried a lot of them!)  The ingredients are coconut milk, water, guar gum---that's it!  I DO wish it said what percentage of coconut milk was in the can, some brands do, but other than that, we are happy with this brand.  It DOES NOT have an expiration date printed on the can (we wish it did).  The price is more than the brands with preservatives, which I don't understand, I wish it were lower, but if we want food with no preservatives/added chemicals, I guess this is what our option is.  Hopefully, the price will come down.  What we don't like is the shipping--9 out of 24 cans in the case were severely or moderately dented, which means we had to use them soon or immediately (not happy at all about that).  However, we will order this brand again.  UPDATE:  Ordered second case, case was shipped \"as is\", broke open during shipping, all 24 cans arrived severely or moderately dented.  Can't even open most of them with a can opener.  Completely unusable and not safe to use.  Unless packing for shipping changes, even though we love the product, we will not order again. Not happy about that, as we can't find a source to purchase locally.  UPDATE:  Contacted Amazon, they sent another case, better packing, only 2 cans minor dented.  Thank you, Amazon!  Will try purchasing again, as we love this stuff!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nYankee Traders Brand, Vanilla Beans, Organic (Whole)- 4 Pods\nReview:\nI ordered these to try them, not wanting a large quantity, if they weren't a good quality.  I have to say, these are just simply excellent!  These are organic from Frontier Co-op, a company I have ordered products from for decades.  Their quality is usually great, like these vanilla beans.  These beans are plump, slightly juicy, filled with paste, VERY fragrant and aromatic.  The fragrance is just intoxicating.  The flavor is very strong/intense.  One half a pod was all I needed to strongly flavor 1.5 quarts of homemade ice cream! The pods are larger and of a better quality than most and much better than those from the local store.  The price is a bit high.  Next time, I will order a larger quantity to save money.  It does NOT say what grade these beans are or the source of origin/variety.  But, just guessing, they seem to be a grade A.  Whatever they are, these are excellent!  I will buy them again!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLipton Yellow Label Tea (loose tea) - 450g\nReview:\nThis is NOT the regular Lipton's Tea sold in the USA.  This Lipton's Yellow Label Tea is what most of the rest of the world drinks when they drink Lipton's.  It is not acidic as is the regular USA version we all know (IE: no pucker/dry mouth).  It is bold, but mellow--sometimes with a hint of smoky flavor.  We first drank this while living overseas, I love this Yellow Label tea.  It is very good made as hot tea as well as iced.  Very good with milk or cream.

It is much lighter than a jar of peanut butter so it transports well. You can add it to grain recipes to give them a nutty flavor. You can use it in chocolates, shakes, etc. We love this and everyone we have told about it loves it too.

The flavor is exceptional!\n\nI repackaged this for longer storage since this is for day to day cooking.

So Since I am a big fan of Korean TV I just had to try this ramen! On the show Potato Star one musician character eats it a lot So I ordered it and BAM! No wonder these actors smile and totally whoof it down! It is definently woofable. So much so I couldn't believe how good it is! I did not cut up the green onion as you see on the top of the package, I should have bought some green onions and sliced them thin and added to the top, but its fine without, more than fine without! Love this stuff. Okay so its spicy...not jalapeno spicey staying in your mouth needing a tortilla or milk to get your tongue back hot, its all together hot in a different way the kind of good hot for hot lovers. Makes you really want more. So spicy and hot with the red chili powder and its smooth and the broth you just want to drink it! Noodles have a great texture not all overly soft, they are firm and really taste better than the typical ramen I buy at my grocery store. Plus you put the water in the bowl, close the lid and when you open the bowl you won't believe the soup its like totally full of noodles like way more than the average ramen. At first the ramen looks all whimpy small and man or man it balloons out to fill the bowl.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNongShim Bowl Noodle Soup, Kimchi, 3.03 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThe absolute best spicy ramen.

I love rosemary and I am not so sure this spice works with the Flax. I am really unsure what would go with this cracker, its really not something you would eat plain. It needs something like a savory dip of sorts, It would take a very dry cheese or perhaps a goat cheese to enjoy. Very different. I plan on trying the other flavors.

Good product; good, fair price; good service. What's not to love?\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDandy Blend, Instant Herbal Beverage with Dandelion, 2 lb. Bag\nReview:\nFoolish and dumb as this may sound, I'd forgotten what impact caffeine has on various health issues - primarily raising my ocular pressure - and that can be serious for those with Glaucoma and other medical eye issues.\nNew job; new pressures; stress; longer hours; inclement weather, and I was brewing more coffee and having more refills; taking bigger travel mugs and not thinking about it. I was using a higher quality of coffee and had read many articles about how organic; higher quality, etc really has more to do with how coffee affects/doesn't affect someone than the actual caffeine component, so I felt I was \"okay\" with drinking more of it. Wrong (at least for me).\nI had forgotten how I used to mix my coffee half and half with Teeccino and that cut down the caffeine. Teeccino's a great product, but it is not very cost effective for me, and I prefer something without the gluten.\n\nIn the past, I tried the packets of Dandy Blend and it was ok. They quickly hardened and dried out so I threw away the unused packets.\nI had received some very bad news from my Ophthalmologist, so back to the drawing board and saw this 2# bag of Dandy Blend, with outstanding reviews and comments and thought I'd give it a go again. After all, it's a MUST!\nNot only is it gluten-free (and they explain on their site 'how' that is); but dandelions are great for the liver which is very closely related to eye issues - they go hand in hand. (I already take Milk Thistle every day for my liver, so this will be an added bonus!)\n\nThen I asked all of you a few questions on the Q/A area (great feature, and big help!). I wanted to be able to brew Dandy Blend along with a scoop of regular coffee grounds (as I did with Teeccino) and you all told me how I could. Score!\nSo, right now I'm enjoying a delicious cup - or two, or three - of mixed brew and eventually will cut out the coffee altogether.\nI was too chicken to put the DB in the brew basket, so I used my normal amount of water for the pot; only put in one scoop of coffee, instead of two, and then when it was finished brewing, I added one rounded tablespoon to the pot and stirred it in.\nFABULOUS!\nThe recipes and ideas on both the bag and the website are great - I would have never thought of doing that. Now I look forward to trying it. I'm getting ready to do some traveling, so will bring some with me.\n\nFolks - we can monitor our BLOOD pressure at home (which I occasionally do); but we cannot monitor our own ocular pressure. Hopefully, one day, it will be possible to do. Fortunately for me, I HAVE to go regularly to keep a close watch on it; but I was without insurance and took my chances and it was almost disastrous. Please be sure to get your eyes checked regularly, especially to check your pressures. It's still the leading cause of blindness.\n\n*****One week later****\nI only mixed with coffee for one week. I ended up loving it so much, I prefer it ALONE! It's delicious! And what's really awesome - no headaches; no fatigue; no withdrawals whatsoever being without coffee!

Here are my thoughts both positive and otherwise.\n\n1) Easily accessible product - found my box at Walmart, for $4.50.\n2) The ingredients are self contained in the box; other than eggs, choice of fat; and liquid.\n3) I like that you have options: water or milk or almond milk, etc; eggs or egg white; various oils or butter\n4) This should easily be touted as another great \"no knead\" bread - just mix and pour.\n5) I like that it gives the options of oven baking or bread machine. I don't have a bread machine so I made mine in the oven.\n6) It rose very quickly and there are not several stages to wait through - just the one rising time.\n7) It was done very quickly.\n8) The bread makes a nice size loaf and slices well, without crumbling\n9) Each slice of bread holds up well to spreading and doesn't tear even when buttering with cold, hard butter - no tearing\n10) The flavor is good enough on its own, but I could also see how adding other ingredients would really be welcome, too. I can see why all the positive remarks that this is probably one of the best GF breads out there.\n\nAnd now for my other comments:\n\nWhile it is Gluten-free, it is not starch free (nor does it claim to be, either). I have a hard time, these days digesting ALL grains, and starches sometimes bother me, too. So, while the ingredients were very clearly stated, I chose to buy the product anyway just to see how well I would 'do' with this particular bread and whether or not to stay with it, or move on to Paleo breads, which are gluten free, as well as grain AND starch free. Only time will tell how I feel after eating this bread.\nMy other comment is that it contains corn starch, and as 80-90% of corn in the US is genetically modified, I'm wondering if that is true with this item as well?\n\nNonetheless, I was pleased with all of its attributes, and if/when I make it again, I'll be sure and not let it brown as much - keep an eye on it! :)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWild Planet Wild Skipjack Tuna (Light Tuna), 5 oz Cans (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nYum, Yum!\nBought it first to try and just now subscribed!\nIt's delicious!

They taste so much better.\n\nBut, I was reading some reviews and saw some comments that the pink salt had fluoride and had all these warnings on it! Well, that made me nervous because I try and avoid fluoride (don't use fluoride toothpaste, etc.). I was so disappointed.\n\nBut, I read further that the fluoride is not 'added', is not the same as the dangerous fluoride found in our water system here, but rather, naturally occurring. I didn't do a whole lot of research about this, but since that made me happy, I ordered it.\n\nI really do love it, and prefer it over all the others, although the grey is nice as well.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I need to find a way to make them stay softer (with traditional cookies I would toss a piece of bread in the bucket-unfortunately we are gf now-so that doesn't exactly work...) I let my cookies cool for 5 mins on the pan-maybe I will do 3 next time. DO NOT TASTE THE DOUGH-my fave part of traditional cookies-I cannot do that with these-it is horrible-I am not sure how the finished product ends up edible but it does! My husband (not df or gf except at home with what I make for him) loves the flavor. They are GREAT coffee dunking cookies (or milk-but it takes longer to soften up). My big kids love them and they are not always gf/df either. I like how they hold up better than the betty crocker ones as well.\nOH-do NOT forget to GREASE YOUR PAN =and I mean A LOT!

I was not expecting a liquid mess when I opened the jar but that is what I got, all over my jacket and floor. It has a consistency better suited to pouring than spreading. Perhaps if being used for drinks this would be acceptable but it doesn't work well as a spread or a dip. As far as the taste goes, it is edible but I didn't find it appealing.

I had the same problem with another of the Happy Belly snack line. Their \"Ziploc\" seals are not of good quality and require the use of a chip clip.

Because it is listed as good for sipping I tried it that way as well and it was very good. I also really like that it comes in 1 cup portions which is great for recipes.

Just as other reviewers have noted, these bars are quite tasty and they don't make me feel bloated, cramped, or uncomfortable in any way. Of course they contain some manmade ingredients (i.e., artificial flavoring) but they're still superior to candy bars. The \"chocolatey peanut butter\" flavor is quite good and these bars stay fresh a while after you pick up a box or two of them. Great!\n\nTrue, there's some saturated fat in these bars but overall they're still good for me; they help me stay regular and that's a huge plus.\n\nI highly recommend these Fiber Plus antioxidant bars from Kellogg's.

True, I have to take a few minutes to chew them--they're not something I can eat very quickly, they're too chewy for that. Most importantly, but they are very  helpful to me when I exercise. For example, they are excellent for a power boost shortly before I exercise; and they help me replenish the salt I lose when I perspire both during and shortly after exercising.\n\nSome will say that these bars really give you protein while others maintain that these bars don't have enough protein. They do have 6 grams of protein per bar so I guess it becomes an individual decision when it comes to just how much protein you want; you could have two bars before a workout or running if extra protein is what you want.\n\nOverall, these bars are great. I love them! They are excellent for athletes and anyone serious about working out, but of course they can be enjoyed as a snack if you wish.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKellogg's Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars (Raspberry, 8-Count Bars, Pack of 6)\nReview:\nKellogg's Nutri Grain cereal bars make for a tasty snack and they are good for when you need quick energy and you're \"on the go.\" They are perfect when you don't have time to eat something more substantial to get quick energy. The price at which Amazon offers them is affordable compared to what my local supermarket charges. These strawberry flavored bars are low in fat and cholesterol, too--a great plus! Moreover, they are even \"certified kosher\" if that matters to you. Moreover, these bars are both chewy and satisfying  SMILE\n\nHowever, this cereal bar is not perfect. Each bar contains 26 grams of carbohydrates and 13 grams of sugar; sugar can sometimes turn into fat in your body. These amounts of carbohydrates and sugar are a lot for a comparatively small cereal bar! Moreover, this food bar is not for anyone on a salt free diet as it contains some salt; and people with allergies to wheat or milk should consult their doctor before they eat this food.\n\nThese bars go down better if you eat them with juice, milk or water. I eat them with water or apple juice myself.\n\nOverall, the strawberry flavored Nutri Grain cereal bars are useful for those of us who are not allergic to any of their ingredients and who want a healthy alternative to a regular breakfast or a candy bar. The Amazon price makes them affordable and I also recommend them as a nutritious snack food that is especially good for people on the run. They are far superior to any candy bar!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFruit Harvest Cereal, Strawberry Blueberry, 12.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nKellogg's Fruit Harvest Strawberry Blueberry packs a huge punch with a great taste and it contains no fat, no trans fats and no cholesterol. It is relatively low in sugar and carbohydrates, too.\n\nDespite the fact that this is one of the best tasting breakfast cereals out there I am disappointed in its vitamin content. The artwork on the box leads you to believe that this cereal just has to be very healthy for you. Yes, it has 25 % of your recommended daily intake of iron, niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, riboflavin, thiamin and folic acid; but I expected this product to be healthier still. I will take off one star for that to make this a four star review.\n\nIt is low in sugar just as they say it is. However, if you aren't getting the proper amount of exercise you need, then the extra sugar in the strawberries, blueberries and corn syrup could turn into sugar inside your body. As always, when planning a diet, it helps to consult your physician before starting a new diet.\n\nNevertheless, the strawberries and blueberries taste delicious--even when you eat this dry and drink milk along with it. Kellogg's Fruit Harvest Cereal offers whole grain which is an important part of any healthy diet.\n\nOverall, Kellogg's Fruit Harvest Strawberry Blueberry breakfast cereal is a great choice to start your day. Sure, it may not be the absolute healthiest cereal on your grocer's shelf but this cereal beats junk food by a mile. Buy some and enjoy today!\n\nSMILE\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nProduct 19 Cereal, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nProduct 19 is an excellent breakfast cereal. It has absolutely no fat, no trans fat, no cholesterol, and it is rather low in sugar content. Excellent! Product 19 even has 100% of vitamins C, E, B12, B16, iron and other nutrients as well. Very impressive! (Amazon states that it has only 10% of these nutrients but that is incorrect.)\n\nOn the other hand, the cereal is low in fiber and it contains sodium and carbohydrates. Check the label to see if you're comfortable with the amounts of ALL the ingredients in this cereal before buying it. Product 19 is something that grew on me; I initially didn't like it but I kept eating it in the morning for health reasons. Over time I appreciated the taste more and more. This may be true for you, too. Not everyone will find this cereal to be tasty the very first time they eat it. You could add a few strawberries or blueberries on top of the cereal to make it sweeter; these berries are also very healthy for you, too.\n\nThe packaging is attractive. The sealed plastic bag inside the box keeps the cereal fresh even a couple of months beyond the expiration date on the box.\n\nOverall, Product 19 is an excellent cereal for people who care about what they eat. It may take a little getting used to because of the taste and the consistency of the cereal flakes. Despite the \"taste factor\" and a few drawbacks concerning sodium and carbohydrates, I highly recommend this cereal as part of a healthy diet.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nRitz Crackers, 10 Count, 37.7 Ounce\nReview:\nRitz crackers by Nabisco have always been one of my favorites. I remember eating them in kindergarten at snack time--I always wanted a couple extra! These crackers have stood the test of time because they are very tasty and great to eat as a snack.\n\nRitz crackers are rather low in fat (4.5 grams of fat per serving) and they have almost no carbohydrates. They are cholesterol free as well--hooray! In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you. The nutrition label indicates that there are no trans-fats but I did notice a bit of partially hydrogenated ingredients on the label--it may be that the amount of trans-fats this generates is negligible.\n\nRitz crackers can be eaten by themselves but feel free to get creative! They can help out when it's time to make snacks for company. Just put a bit of cheese (or melted cheese and ham) on them and you're serving up great appetizers or snack in no time! They go great with a little bit of butter on them, too.\n\nOverall, Ritz crackers really hit the spot when I crave a snack before bedtime. I simply take a slice of two of regular cheese and place little bits of the cheese on top of the crackers and with a small beverage it's awesome!\n\nI highly recommend Ritz crackers as one of the healthier crackers that will satisfy you, too. Great!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGatorade Performance Series Carbohydrate Energy Formula, Wild Berry, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nGatorade performance series carbohydrate energy formula is not my favorite tasting beverage; but for the athletes amongst us it can sure make excellent sense to drink this stuff! I am no athlete; I only drink this sporadically. This drink is best suited for people who train intensively and people who compete in sporting competitions. It's essentially a \"high octane\" version of regular Gatorade. It does have a somewhat pleasant berry, fruity taste to it that is enhanced by huge amounts of sugar. If the taste isn't too great, try to refrigerate this before drinking it. Leave any leftover Gatorade refrigerated for best taste and nutritional value.\n\nGatorade comes in a firm plastic bottle with a cap that screws on and off for easy drinking. It contains 79 grams of carbs that you will probably lose if you're really exercising a lot. In addition, this type of Gatorade has sodium (ouch) BUT it will rehydrate you fast after you work out. It may also be helpful to drink Gatorade if you have diarrhea; ask your doctor about this. It's also worth noting that this type of Gatorade contains 25% of the recommended daily intake of niacin, B6, and pantothenic acid\n\nIn addition, Gatorade can give you an energy boost without making you lose sleep; this is because Gatorade has sugar but no caffeine.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Gatorade as more than just a snack drink. Gatorade helps you to rehydrate after you sweat a lot during a work out or some type of sporting competition; and it gives you an energy boost as well while replenishing any carbohydrates you may have lost doing exercise. It may also be beneficial when you're on chemotherapy (as I am) to balance out your body's system. I believe that this type of Gatorade also contains electrolytes that can be beneficial to your system.\n\nIf you have any questions about Gatorade ask your doctor before drinking this beverage.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I suffer from extreme allergies and am going through acupuncture to get rid of my body's reaction to these allergies.  In the meantime going off antihistamines this tea really works wonders. The Bi Yan Pian disolves mucus from allergy reactions thereby letting your body get rid of the toxins.  Antihistamines dry you making the toxins stay in your body and oh yeah it lowers your immunity so you get sick.  Good reason to go off anithistamines.  This tea tastes very good with the combination; I use honey with ginger and that is amazing.  I will continue using this tea as needed because it works so well if I drink too much I'm actually too dry...but then the acupuncture is part of that too.

I used to live on the East Coast where they have Nuts to You shops that bake peanuts fresh in the store. They were amazing, naturally. These peanuts don't have the depth of freshly baked peanuts, but what they do have is crunch. They give you a very satisfying snap when you bite into them and they have a rich flavor with just enough salt. I expected them to last a lot longer than they did, but I couldn't stop eating them.

I love receiving chocolate surprises in the mail. This candy was fresh and delicious. Chocolate - that is good chocolate will solve a whole lot of problems. This gift made me feel really special and loved. I know it is the thought that counts but when it's chocolate and this delicious, that counts even more! Somehow when chocolate is a gift, it tastes even better. I particularly enjoyed the Kit Kat bars but all of them were yummy. And yes, I did share!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWHOPPERS Candy (Chocolate Covered Malted Milk Candy Balls),7 Ounce Bag (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese are some of my favorites. We like to munch of these while we watch movies on television. I bought some recently to use in a cookie recipe that sounded delicious but I waited too long to start baking. Somebody had eaten all of my malted milk balls and left the carton on the counter. I was mad but as usual I got over it. I will try that recipe some other time. Whoppers are just too good to be left alone for any length of time at my house. They don't hang around very long at all.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S Baking Cocoa, SPECIAL DARK Hot Cocoa, 8 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThe very best chocolate cake recipe ever, ever, ever is on the back of the Hershey's cocoa box. If you don't believe me, then you should try it. You will like it if you do like chocolate. I grew up with my Mother using Hershey's cocoa for everything chocolate. It is a great product and I would not have any other. And it is good for you, too.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHershey's Nuggets Chocolates Assortment, 38.5 oz (Old)\nReview:\nI am a chocolate lover for sure but mostly in the cooler months for some reason. Hershey's nuggets are perfect for me. You get a variety of choices when you select this assortment. I like all of them and usually don't peek when I reach into the bag. That way I get a pleasant surprise. I probably like the dark chocolate the best but I enjoy all of the choices. If you eat two of three pieces of chocolate, you don't feel so piggy which is another good thing. I find that one piece of chocolate usually satisfies me so this bag lasts a while. It is a good choice for my family. Hersheys just make a very good product that continues to maintain a very excellent product. You can't go wrong with Hersheys.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSkittles Original Candy, 9 ounce bag\nReview:\nThis is just a special treat for our girl.

We enjoy corn flakes quite a lot. The crunch is good. The flavor is good. The price is good, too. Sometimes at night we indulge in a tasty bowl of cornflakes as we sit by the flickering light of the television as a special treat to ourselves. I have caught family members just enjoying corn flakes by the handful just out of the box. Any of those ways is pretty good. There is one more thing that I do with corn flakes. I make delicious corn flake cookies. These have to be made on a day that is not rainy or damp as egg whites have to be whipped with the corn flakes gently folded in and baked in a low oven. They are truly delicious. We never let any corn flakes go to waste at our house!\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

A friend told me she liked the brand, so when I saw it at the grocery store, I grabbed a bottle. The main difference between Dole and Langers is Langers comes from a concentrate, and Dole may or may not be from a concentrate (plus Dole is now adding Vitamin E & Vitamin A). They are both products of the Philippines.\n\nLanger's seems a little sweeter, though the RDA label states they have the same calories and sugars count. Langers is also a touch thicker, like they emulsified it, as there aren't any bits of pulp settling down to the bottom of the bottle, or perhaps that's because it's pasteurized.

I was very happy to see this again. They haven't changed the sauce at all and it makes plenty for the given amount of pasta. The pasta is not gummy/starchy at all like other store purchased brands I've tried. If they actually pkg'd their pasta I would buy it though I normally just make pasta prior to serving it. Don't care about their parm cheese but then I also don't buy their brand, I'd rather buy a wedge and grate it myself b/c the flavor it so much better.\nUPDATE 5/2015: EXPIRES 1/2016\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHormel Compleats Beef Rib Tips with Mashed Potatoes and Gravy, 9 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nHas about 15 1/2\" cubes of tender beef rib steak tips.\nPotatoes are okay, nothing to really talk about.

Would be good to mix the entire thing up and pour over a grain, bread or noodles. Stated low in sodium but it does come across as salty. Gravy has a powdered garlic taste.

Traditionally espresso, unlike good drip coffee, is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees. The taste differences are noticeable, but I don't have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.\n\nIf you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly on the \"best before\" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get \"expired\" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso.

It's NOT stale, unnatural, gummy, flat, tough, phony, bitter, sour, or just plain \"off\" in taste or texture.  Then again, it's not fresh apple pie either.\n\nHowever, the predominant notes are cinnamon and raisins with some raw oat-y undertones, and it's comforting to discover that these are among the ingredients--70% of which are organic.  There is a slight apple-like undertone, but that may be by association, the cinnamon scent reminds one of pumpkins, coffee cake, waffles, and more. It's slightly chewy, but easily eaten and not dry.  The oats (especially) and walnuts add to the texture, although I didn't detect much walnut flavor (although there was that \"waffle\"-like taste). At any rate, the combination of flavors is excellent, making this an actually enjoyable little treat!\n\nIngredients: Organic Brown Rice Syrup, ClifProTM (Soy Rice Crisps [Soy Protein Isolate, Rice Flour, Malt Extract], Organic Roasted Soybeans, Organic Soy Flour), Organic Rolled Oats, Raisins, Walnuts, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, ClifCrunchTM (Organic Oat Fiber, Chicory Extract, Organic Flaxseed, Psyllium), Organic Oat Bran, Molasses Powder, Natural Flavors, Ground Cinnamon, Sea Salt\n\nNutritional Facts: (Amount per serving is followed by % of daily value) Total Fat: 5 g, 8%;Saturated Fat: 1 g; 4% Trans Fat: 0 gr; Cholesterol 0 mg, Sodium 130 mg, 5%; Potassium 310 mg, 9%;Total Carbohydrates: 43 g, 14%; Dietary Fiber: 5 g, 20%; Insoluble Fiber: 3 g; Sugars: 20 g; Other Carbohydrates 18 g; Protein 10 g  20%.\n\nThe Clif website also reports that \"Walnuts are a source of Omega-3s\"  (there are 400mg of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids per serving), but adds (or their lawyers add): \"Supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.

Bon appetit!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCLIF BAR - Energy Bar - Apricot - (2.4 Ounce Protein Bar, 12 Count)\nReview:\nMain Points:\n\nMuch better then their \"Nutrition\" line peanut butter bar, the \"regular\" chocolate brownie bar has a rich flavor and a chewy, slightly nutty, substantial texture.  Unfortunately, there is an aftertaste that belies the initial flavor jolt, and-once tasted-it becomes more prominent. There's a raisiny, plum-y sort of taste (which may come from the figs inside) that threatens the chocolate integrity. Overall, however, it's quite tasty, filling, and eminently portable.\n\nIngredients:\n\nClif Bars feature organic, healthy ingredients, heavy on soy products. The ingredients include (as listed) organic brown rice syrup, organic rolled oats, \"Clifpro\" (a blend of soy protein isolate, rice flour, malt extract, organic roasted soybeans, organic soy flour), organic evaporated cane sugar, chocolate chips, fig paste, organic soy butter, cocoa, organic milled flaxseed, chicory, sea salt, Dutch cocoa, other natural flavors, and a pharmacopoeia of vitamins and minerals.\n\nNutrition:\n\nAnalysis of a 68-gram bar reveals the following:\n\nCalories 240; Calories from Fat, 40; Total Fat, 4.5 grams; Saturated Fat, 1.5 g; Protein, 10 g; Dietary Fiber, 5g; Insoluble Fiber, 4g; Sugars, 20g; and Total Carbohydrates, 45g; and Sodium, 150mg. (This is basically comparable to the horrendous tasting Nutrition Crunchy Peanut Butter Bar mentioned above.) There are 100% of Daily Requirements of Vitamins C and E, and about 15-35% of many other vitamins and minerals (most of which are added directly to the product-see list above). Here's a nutritional comparison with the Clif \"Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup\":\n\nCalories 220, Fat Calories 20, Total Fat (g) 2.5, Sat.

Fat content is a little bit higher than their Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, although this product has a bit more protein. While I can't give nutritional recommendations, I hope the information above is helpful.  The taste and texture are very good for this kind of product.

It has just enough chocolate (from chocolate chips, see ingredient list) to impart a chocolate flavor. Not a heavy or rich chocolate flavor, but an unmistakable one: You don't have to close your eyes, and convince yourself that it's chocolate.\n\nThis has a \"Bit-O-Honey\" -like chewy texture with honey overtones. Throw in some sticky peanut butter and chocolate, and you've pretty much captured the flavor. To my surprise, however, there is no honey. Clif gets that taste from syrups, malt, cane juice, fig paste, and other sweet ingredients.\n\nIt's definitely filling, especially if accompanied by an apple or something, and at least eight ounces of water.  While chewy, it doesn't seem as dry as similar products. Could it be the six grams of fat-two of which are saturated?  Made with 70% organic ingredients, this bar has a whopping 11 grams of protein, only 20 grams of sugar (compare that with other brands and flavors), and includes five grams of fiber. Along with Clif's Z-bar and the excellent Clif apple raisin walnut, this is one of the better tasting of its kind--just don't expect a brownie.\n\nIngredients at the time of this review.

Although nothhing tastes like a blueberry as much as a blueberry, once you adjust (about 4 initial mouthfuls) the KIND version of blueberry, you'll not only love the taste, but it will seem close enough to the real thing that you'll have a Blueberry Experience!  NOt too crunchy, yet not too soft or crumbly, these have a great blueberry/flax/cinnamon flavor which I loved. (Non-cinnamon fans should stay away).\n\nThe product is slightly pricey, but this is offset by how filling it is--especially when consumed with water.  I'd recommend this as a pick-me-up/snack almost anytime,; for example, while at the office, on a hike, taking a break from a bike ride, etc. The ingredients tasted fresh (one unlucky reviewer reported a \"rancid\" ingredient). Overall a very tasty and satisfying snack food.  Highly recommended!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWorcestershire Sauce, Organic, 6.25 oz.\nReview:\nAnnie's, the friendly company, makes this fine organic and vegetarian Worcestershire Sauce (it appears that other products have anchovies in them, hence their non-vegetarian status). Made in the beautiful state of Vermont (not too far from Ben and Jerry's) this apple cider vinegar, molasses, soy sauce based product adds a lot of dark spicy flavor to stir fries, hamburgers (I'm imagining here that you'll probably get soy burgers, and anything needing a sweet/sour/spicy kick to it. As suggested above, great in sauces and stews too.\n\nIn each large (perhaps recipe-based) 2 tablespoon serving (about seven servings per container), you get the following nutritional components:\n\n20 calories, no fat, 460 mg. of sodium, 5 grams of carbohydrate (four of which are sugars), and bit of protein (< than 1 gram). Other information about Annie's company and products are on the web at anniesnaturals.com\n\nHint: For more fun, teach some youngsters to spell \"Worcestershire,\" show them where it is on the map, and read \"The Wind in the Willows\" to them!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYork Peppermint Patties Dark Chocolate Covered Mint Candy, 66.7 Ounce\nReview:\nYes, this is the candy that inspired the name of Patricia Peppermint Patty of Peanuts, (she's the likable, intelligent, assertive one) who pitched a no-hitter and clobbered 5 home runs in one game (and pitched a no-hit, 50-0 game which Charlie Brown lost for her with just one out), who got a D- on every one of her school assignments, and who has kind of a thing for Chuck.  Just like Patty, this candy is a classic.\n\nIf you like chocolate and you like mint, theres no better candy.  The bright, fresh mint taste explodes at first bite, somewhat mellowed and balanced by the smooth chocolate covering: The chocolate really gets second billing here, although it becomes more noticeable in the aftertaste. Its incredibly sweet, but somehow doesnt overpower, and the urge for more can be difficult to quell.  Some nutritional information might help, but even that may not be enough.\n\nIn three \"Dark Chocolate Covered York Peppermint Patties (41 grams), there are 150 calories,  3g total fat, 2g saturated fat, no trans fat or cholesterol, 33g total carbohydrate , 27g sugar,  15g sodium, < 1g dietary fiber < 1g of protein, 2% of  RDA of protein, and 0% of the RDA of vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium. Not health food, but better than some other candies on the block. Of course, this assumes you eat ONLY THREE PEPPERMINT PATTIES. The ingredients also compare favorably with other candies: Sugar, corn syrup, semi-sweet chocolate (chocolate, sugar, cocoa, milk fat, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, PGPR, vanillin (artificial flavor), invert sugar, egg whites, oil of peppermint, milk.  PGPR stands for Polyglycerol polyricinoleate, an emulsifier made with glycerol and fatty acids.  At least theres no artificial flavors to go along with all that sugars, carbohydrates, and calories.  BY the way, the people at [...] have far worse (nutritionally) data for a York Peppermint Pattie, but one can't tell if their information (which is for one piece only) is for this exact same candy as listed here, or some other version.  You can call the Hershey Company in (of course) Hershey, Pennsylvania to pursue this further, 1-800-468-1714, or go to [...]\n\nLike Patty, Pattie is irresistible.  (I love that he is her ice-skating coach, and she thinks hes a \"funny-looking kid with a big nose.\")  Theres no denying that this is one delicious treat.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Chocolate, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nTasting and Texture Notes for Banana Flavor Power Bar.\n\nFlavor: The predominant flavor is apples and cinnamon, with a persistent banana undertone, as well as tastes of raisin.  While not a rich banana flavor, it is recognizable, and none of the flavors seems off-tone-much more than can be said for similar products.  After looking at the ingredients below, I was very surprised that the banana power bar contains no cinnamon, and that the apple taste may be actually come from the grape and pear concentrates.  The ingredient list also reveals several grains (oat bran, rice bran, milled rice, brown rice flour), and the source of the banana flavor-banana powder.\n\nTexture: After the initial touch bite into the dense, somewhat hard surface, the ingredients gradually present themselves as very chewy with a noticeable grainy texture.  Again, while initiates may need time to get used to this, it is not unpleasant, and the chewy quality gives the impression of substance (although there are only 3 grams of dietary fiber, as seen below).  I left one semi-open for a day or so, and found that the bar was easier to bite into, perhaps due to moisture absorption.\n\nNutritional Information:\n\n(The information below is from the website, [...] and differs slightly from the Amazon.com list.)\n\n230 Calories, 10 Calories from Fat, Total Fat 2.5 mg (Saturated Fat, 0.5 g and Trans Fat, 0 g.), Cholesterol 0 mg; Sodium, 100 mg; Potassium, 190 mg; Total Carbohydrates 45 g (Dietary Fiber 3g, Sugars, 20g; Other Carbohydrates, 22 g); Protein, 9g\n\n*Percent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.\n\nVitamin A 0%*  Vitamin C 100% ,Calcium 30% , Iron 35% , Vitamin E 100% , Thiamin 100% , Riboflavin 100% , Niacin 100% , Vitamin B6 100% , Folate 100% ,Vitamin B12 100% , Biotin 100% , Pantothenic Acid 100% , Phosphorus 35% , Magnesium 35% , Zinc 35% ,Copper 35%,Chromium 20%, Chloride <2%\n\nIngredients:\n\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup With Grape And Pear Juice Concentrate, Oat Bran, Maltodextrin, Milk Protein Isolate, Banana Powder, Almond Butter, Rice Crisps (Milled Rice, Rice Bran), Brown Rice Flour, Glycerin, Natural Flavors, Soy Protein Isolate.

This dark roast is full of flavor, never gets acrid, never tastes burnt--even when left in the pot too long!  It does not irritate your stomach or leave an aftertaste.

You can make a strong pot of Deadman's Reach and not taste anything bitter.  But the caffeine level will surprise you.  It may say it's a dark roast, but it tastes like a rather plain medium roast.  In fact, I have had blonde roasts that are similar in taste to this coffee.  You are not getting a very flavorful cup of Joe here, but a pleasant smoothness that delivers a caffeinated punch.\n\nI view this blend as a utilitarian blend.  You need caffeine?  Buy it.  You need a gentler flavor?  Buy it.  Not fond of aromatic coffee?  Buy it.\n\nDeadman's Reach lacks the impressive flavor and aroma of Kicking Horse Coffee blends and lacks the heavier, bold caffeine grip of Valhalla Java from Deathwish.  It's still much better than Dunkin Donuts or most of Starbuck's coffees.  You can taste the quality.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nDeath Wish &amp; Valhalla Java Whole Bean Coffee Bundle Deal, USDA Certified Organic &amp; Fair Trade (1 of Each Bag)\nReview:\nTwo great coffees, perfect together.

Nothing soft or sweet about these bad boys.  They make a tough cup of Joe that tastes good.  I will say that, if you make them too light, they lose a lot of their flavor, IMO.  Valhalla also seems to have a better caffeine punch in the face.\n\nBuy it.  Brew it.

No stomach issues or acid issues.  Even when it's been left in the pot too long, its drinkable!  I don't recommend old coffee, but that has to attest to this coffee's quality.  It never tastes burnt.\n\nHoodoo Jo is unique in that it has a strong medium flavor to me, yet it definitely has \"fruity\" undertones.  But nothing weird that gets in the way of that coffee taste we all crave.  It is not sweet, but pleasant.  Different.  Earthy and fruity is the best way I can describe it--even though fruity makes you think of sweetness.  I simply mean it has a natural flavor that attracts you like fruit does.  Very interesting.  Very tasty.\n\nIt will not turn off the hardcore dark lovers OR the light drinkers.

Go try Taste Nirvana's real coconut water made from Thai coconuts, and you'll understand what I'm talking about.

Each individually wrapped bar contains 200 calories, with only 60 calories from fat. There are 13 grams of sugar in each portion.  The bar has 5 grams of protein, so you wouldn't call it a \"protein bar\" (this designation seems to refer to something greater than 10 grams of protein).  The top three ingredients are brown rice syrup, cashews, and oats.  There's not much fiber (2 grams).\n\nSize-wise, this is not a large bar.  The weight is 49 grams (1.76 ounces), which makes it smaller than, say, a Clif bar.  It is easy to chew, and it doesn't fall apart as you are eating it (a real problem with some bars).  For this flavor, the mint chocolate chip  is not overpowering.  That's a good thing.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nHoney Stinger Organic Waffle, Caramel, Sports Nutrition, 1.06 Ounce (16 Count)\nReview:\nThese Honey Stinger waffles are not as \"crispy\" as some other brands, and I like that.

As they are cooking, dice up tomatoes (1/4 cup), walnuts (1/4 cup), and green olives ((1/8 cup), as well as 1/4 cup of sharp cheddar cheese.  Add to cooked noodles with cheese packet and stir.\n\nYummy!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Chocolate, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nMe, I'm generally a big fan of PowerBars.  I don't look at them as \"power bars,\" but rather snacks that are agreeable, tasty, convenient, portable, and nutritious.\n\nPowerBar's Fruit Smoothie (\"Berry Blast\" flavor) is almost there, with a few big caveats.\n\nI shared my PowerBar with 4 others, teens and adults.  All found the flavor better than expected.  One noted that it had a \"fruity gum\" flavor.  I had a similar reaction; it wasn't unpleasant.  All gave it a thumbs up for flavor.\n\nThe consistency was soft in 80 degree heat, like soft taffy.  When placed on a plate, it stuck to the plate and you had to literally peel it off.  There was a sticky residue left on your fingers and on the inside of the packaging.  This didn't make it the cleanest snack.\n\nThere were the 24g of sugar in one serving.  I thought this made it too sweet.\n\nMy biggest complaint was the lack of dietary fiber in this \"fruit smoothie\" (less than 1 gram; PowerBar's Harvest Bars have 5g).  The illusion is a package of real fruit.  Well, real fruit is full of soluble and insoluble fibers, essential nutrients.  The fiber tossed out in the manufacturing process here probably ended up as livestock feed, which is ironic when you think about it.\n\nSo for the consumers who have the illusion that they are 'eating\" a real fruit smoothie,  this bar is, obviously, something else.  Just remember, the PowerBar Fruit Smoothie isn't going to replace a banana and a Clementine orange in your diet.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:  Two years later, with a much more strenuous workout regime (participated in Wasatch Back RAGNAR relay last month, 29 hours, 189 miles), the thing I like about this bar is that it is easy on the stomach as a recovery bar.  It's not a candy bar or, if you use it as one, it's an expensive piece.  I use it AFTER a run or strenuous workout (defined as a run of at least 5 miles, 8.5 minute miles or better, or a full hour of core workouts).  I like the tanginess.\n\n Just throw some in your gym bag.  You're good to go!\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nPowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Chocolate, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nYou need a magic tonic to help you recover following a new personal best?  Good luck funding one.\n\nYou want a candy bar?  Keep looking.\n\nHowever, if you want a well-packaged, carb-rich bar that won't melt in your hands, that will give you a sugar replacement that 15 minutes following your intense activity lasting 45-60 minutes, then this PowerBar Performance Energy Bar might work for you.\n\nNonfat chocolate milk might work just as well, but it certainly won't last 12 months in that pack under your bike seat or in your backpack's side pocket.\n\nKnow what you are getting, and use it appropriately.  Then you won't be disappointed!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKettle Brand Potato Chips, Krinkle Cut Salt &amp; Fresh Ground Pepper, 8.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nClassic, tasty calories in the form of a potato chip seasoned with salt and pepper... ahhh.  They are well-packaged, but how do you control your eating?  Well, the bag folds over nicely and, when closed with a clip, the chips stay fresh.  So you can't use the excuse, \"I needed to eat them before they went stale.\"  And the pepper keeps you from just gobbling them all down.  Maybe.\n\nIt's a treat for those of us disciplined enough to control our portions.

The color and flavor were weak, though since I didn't like the taste that didn't bother me too much.  Furthermore, my husband is a neuroscientist and says that GABA is exactly the opposite of what the vendor purports -- it's an inhibitory neurotransmitter (though  Wikipedia tells us that GABA *is* be an excitatory transmitter in children and insects, so this may do you some good if you're a young bee; otherwise, I'd pass this up -- unless you enjoy the flavor of watery apple tea.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nBrooklyn Beans Fuhgeddaboutit Decaf Coffee Single-Cup Coffee for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 40 Count\nReview:\nVery pleasantly surprised by this great decaf collection.

I'm giving this item 2 stars because the flavor was fine; though one child said it tasted \"like vitamins\", I think he meant the good fruit-tasting vitamins. The problem with this bar is the texture -- it is VERY gummy, and even stretched a bit when we cut it into portions. As one chews, it becomes rubbery; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one-third portion because it was so unpleasant. If you're prepared for the texture you may enjoy the fine flavor, but otherwise I'd suggest you steer clear of this energy bar.\nRating:\n2.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

They're not my favorite, but they are not bad. This one has a strong fruity flavor, similiar to taffy. The \"vitamin flavor\" is noticeable, but not horrendously strong. This is a good choice for an occasional snack on the go. Power bars keep well in the car and if they get too mushy due to heat, they recover well when cool again.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nreGen Chocolate Muscle Recovery Beverage, 11-Ounce Containers (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nFor those of you who are wondering:\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER; SUGAR; COCOA; MILK; PROTEIN ISOLATE; CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF: CANOLA OIL; MALTODEXTRIN; RICE STARCH; CELLULISE GEL; DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE; SALT; NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR; MAGNESIUM PHOSPHATE; CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE; TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE; CARRAGEENAN; DEXTROSE; VITAMIN E ACETATE; VITAMIN A PALMITATE; VITAMIN D\n\nEach serving is 11oz and has 11 grams of protein, 200 calories, total fat 4.5g, colest 5mg, sodium 320mg, carb 35g, and RDAs: 10% vit A, 20% calcuim, 10% vit D, 15% potassium, 6% iron, 10% vit E, and 25% magnesium.\n\nUnsure why amazon doesn't require vendor to list this in the product description.\n\nTaste-wise, imagine making a cup of hot cocoa and putting in the fridge. It tastes like that except it's thick and has a slightly bitter aftertaste. Probably will be easy to get used to the aftertaste.\n\nThe package design is good with a large enough hole to allow the product to flow out smoothly.\n\nAfter a workout, I really don't want to slup down 200 calories in a single gulp, so I'm dividing these into 2 portions as 100 calories is a better portion. Even though I lift weights and a recovery beverage is good, I have a difficult time drinking it directly after working out as recommended because it is so thick. I do better with water.\n\nThis stuff would probably be optimal for large guys who need a lot of calories and don't mind a thick drink after a work out.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nRitter Sport, Alpine Milk Chocolate, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nRitter Sport Milk CHocolate bar is a basic milk chocolate candy bar. It comes in a rather thick brick divided into 16 squares. These are large candy bars, the nutrition information says it's about 3 servings, a child or small person would probably be happy with 4 squares (1/4 of the bar). Personally, I eat the whole thing, If I bought these by the dozen, I would not be small.\n\nTHe chocolate itself is wonderful, smooth and creamy. It has about 30% cocoa content. If you prefer dark chocolate, Ritter Sport's dark chocolate candy is wonderful too.\n\nLast week, we ran out of chocolate chips and wanted cookies, so we all coughed up our squirreled away ritter sport bars and broke them into bits. THose cookies were the best we've ever had.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S Chocolate Snack Mix, 6 Ounce (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nThese are tube shaped snack bags full of bite sized Hershey bar clumps.

They are filled with nuts.\n\nBeware, these are big tubes and NOT for anyone counting calories.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeanut Butter &amp; Co. Chocmeister Hazelnut Spread, Milk Chocolatey, 13 Ounce Jar\nReview:\nThis has a nice dark chocolate flavor which, unfortunately, drowns out the hazelnut flavor. It tastes a little dry, like there's not enough oil in it - and I don't care for greasy or oil foods. While I prefer dark chocolate to milk chocolate - if I eat hazelnut spread then I want to taste hazelnuts, so I'm going to stick with leading brand for now.\n\nClaims:\n* While it has \"25% less sugar\" than the leading brand - it still has the SAME CALORIES! How does this help?\n* \"50% more protein\" translates to 1 extra gram in the 200 calorie serving - meh.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nMerci European Chocolates, Assortment, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nThis chocolate assortment is delicious, rich, smooth and creamy as only European chocolates can be.

Once I figured out the right amount to put in the waffle iron, they cooked efficiently in my Belgian waffle maker.\n\nThey were really sweet -- and every bite had the taste of chocolate chip. I would have preferred something a bit more subtle, and with the sweet taste, I found very little need for butter or syrup as I would normally top my waffles with. Perhaps this was also related to the amount of oil I used (in terms of being rich) as I also found the waffles a bit greasy -- and not light and fluffy. I'd suggest halving the suggested amount of oil for a less greasy and slightly healthier waffle. Pancakes are similarly easy to make on a griddle or frying pan with this mix, but you won't need any oil.\n\nIf you love chocolate chips and want an organic mix for breakfast, you've found your product. The price is reasonable for an organic product. But if you want something more subtly sweet, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNutri-Grain Kellogg's Soft Baked Chocolate, Raspberry, 10.4 oz\nReview:\nIf you like chocolate bars as *part* of your breakfast, this is your bar. If you like raspberry, this isn't your bar. The raspberry taste is nearly nothing to me and there's not much filling inside. They are very thin and soft, however, so easy to bite down whenever you are hungry.\n\nWhile loaded with some added nutrients, there's still 12g of sugar per bar and plenty of artificial ingredients. At 4g fat per bar (and you'll likely want a couple to fill you up), it's an okay snack, but it is not a meal replacement or protein bar. It's more like a cookie or dessert, but there are better alternatives out there. Because they are so small, you'll if you're using them as a meal or large snack, you'll likely want something else.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nOrganic Valley, Organic Milk Boxes, 1% Plain Lowfat Milk, 6.75 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nIts milk - but its ultra-high temperature (UHT) processed that you don't need to keep cold until opened. The milk I received had a best by date about five months out, so it has a pretty good shelf life. Elsewhere in the world, UHT is the most popular type of milk and is the cheapest variety available.\n\nIt tasted pretty much the same as other 1% organic milk Ive consumed, but there is a slight taste difference with UHT  perhaps a tad sweeter, but otherwise I don't know how to explain it. The milk cartons are in a convenient 6.75oz size for an easy 90 calorie drink with only 10g sugar, but they are terribly expensive at over a buck a carton. Theyre well made with a convenient straw, but Im not sure I can justify such a price for something that is much cheaper in the regular refrigerated version.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nLindt LINDOR Dark Chocolate Truffles, Kosher, 60 Count Box, 25.4 Ounce\nReview:\nDark chocolate is extremely popular and the large bite size Lindor Lindt Dark Chocolate Truffles fit smoothly into that desirable dessert category.  First, the dark chocolate is smooth as the package states, the chocolate is very meltable and easy to chew, unlike some hard dark chocolates, and the individually wrapped pieces are perfect for a small treat. Nice to put out after a dinner party as well.\n\nThe ingredients are pure, though the fat is a bit high, and if you don't want so many calories, eating just one piece keeps the calorie count under 100.  Since it's such a delightful taste, just one can be savored and enjoyed without the need to open more. It's a nice gift since you can give a whole package or just individual pieces which are each wrapped separately. Except for the fat, the nutrition facts aren't that bad, so you don't feel so guilty indulging. Any how, there is no \"healthy chocolate\" and I enjoy eating these as an occasional pleasure.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPowerBar Performance Energy Bar, Chocolate, 2.29-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nFirst immediate impression: really sweet and artificial tasting. Though it kind of tastes like fruit punch in my opinion, it's kind of a shocking type of taste for a product like this. Definitely a bit like candy as reviewers have mentioned.\n\nApart for the energy, it did keep me going for a game of basketball I had about an hour after eating the bar. Nutrition facts aren't that great compared to completing products, however. And like other products from this manufacturer, they're still quite expensive per single bar.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nEat. Think. Smile. Chewy Granola Bars, Rich Cocoa, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nFrom the moment you cut open the package, the cocoa smell wafts out, and you know you're in for a treat.  The Eat. Think. Smile. rich cocoa granola bar is delicious and healthy, a sometimes rare combination. It's easy to understand the ingredients and is easy to nibble on for a great quick breakfast or snack.\n\nThe special African cocoa has antioxidants, according to the package, and is comparable to a cup of green tea, one of my favorite accompaniments.  The box and web site explain the details about how healthful cocoa is, and why its CocoaOne is so special and exactly where it comes from.  Each main ingredient in these bars, whole grain oats, rice, cocoa, and nuts, stands out nicely.  There is a lot of competition for granola bars, but this one is low in sugar and fat, though it isn't high in fiber, it does contain some, 3 grams per bar.\n\nThere is crunch when you bite in, though an occasional piece may be a bit hard, you know you've got something substantive.  It's not sticky like some bars and doesn't crumble which makes it easy to eat on the go.  It comes in other flavors, which I have actually tried, and I'm impressed with the choices.  I'm think the name is too long and it would be better with just one word, instead of trying to be clever with  fanciful sayings. However, the product is tasty and hopefully, good for you. It's nice to see a company promoting a product for healthy living.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKellogg's Raisin Bran Cereals, Cinnamon and Almond, 14.5-Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nSo many cereals and so few mornings to enjoy them!  I remember the time when I would choose between Cheerios or corn flakes, now my pantry probably has 15 different cereals including oatmeal; however I have always been a raisin bran fan and often could trick myself into thinking I was eating something healthy (bran). 18 grams of sugar is not a small amount and with the addition of cinnamon added to the coated sweetened raisins the pandering to children's taste buds is ridiculous.  I admit I like the addition of almonds, but I believe this has been done before?  Using my box of puffed rice (naturally sweet) as a sort of base comparison, I was astonished to contrast it with the Raisin bran ingredients.  Puffed rice has no added sugar but is sweet enough, while the raisin bran has sugar, brown sugar, dextrose, cinnamon and honey.  (The last 4 items are under 2% but who needs them.)\n\nCould I become addicted to this cereal, probably yes.  But even after the first taste test (A full bowl of just raisin bran Cinnamon Almond) I knew I would have to mix it with something else (Shredded wheat for example) to bring down the sugar count and the calories (240 with milk).  My general advice is don't give up on basic raisin bran but stay away from the expanded raisin brans.  This new product will not revive the cereal industry, but push us more toward generic healthier cereals.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

A very large bowl was filled with just the small amount of corn put up to the \"fill line\" in the popper.  Add butter or or olive oil and salt to taste, and get FAR better quality popcorn than you'll buy in bags at the store.  This popped up great, taste was great, and almost no waste.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n4204 Great Northern Popcorn Organic Yellow Gourmet Popcorn All Natural, 5 Pounds\nReview:\nUsing the Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Popper, the unpopped kernels are almost non-existent.  This popcorn pops up beautifully, with virtually no waste.  Typically there are two or three, maybe four unpopped kernals that fly out into the bowel at the beginning of the popping process, but about the same number that are left in the popper when everything has stopped popping - in other words, virtually no waste.\n\nAnd while I don't like plain popcorn, this is ALMOST good enough to eat without anything on it.  But I'll stick to good old fashioned butter and salt.  Regardless, this popcorn is about the best we've ever tasted, and is the only brand we intend to purchase in the future.  What else could one want: it's organic, non-GMO, has great flavor, and there is almost zero waste!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKaffree Roma, 7 oz (pack of 6 )\nReview:\nMy wife stopped drinking coffee almost 40 years ago, and has tried just about every \"coffee substitute\" out there.

They're not overly sweet, which is a plus for me, and the ginger molasses flavor is nicely balanced.  The texture is a bit chewy, which I prefer over a hard, crispy cookie.  I'd say they're a good option for those who enjoy a more complex flavor profile than your average chocolate chip cookie.  I'd probably buy these again, especially if I'm looking for something a little different. \nRating:\n4.0 ", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an Amazon customer that likes to write reviews for products.

I normally don't like hard, packaged cookies, but these weren't half bad.  I was actually sorry to see the bag run out!\n\nThese were crunchy without being stale.  As one of the other reviewers said, they have a lot in common with vanilla wafers.  While I didn't try this, I suspect they'd be excellent as part of a cheesecake crumb crust -- and they're whole grain (and gluten free, if that's important to you), unlike the vanilla wafers you buy at the store.  Plus, if you end up with broken pieces, they'll still work in a crumb crust!\n\nThe vanilla taste was great.  These are sweet without being too sweet, they're pretty low in sodium, and they're fairly low in fat (nutrition facts are currently in one of the product images).  I have had the chocolate chip ones before but I like these a lot better.  Although they'd certainly work for recipes, they also make a decent snack on their own.  And the whole grain flour makes them better for you than other packaged cookies would be.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHomefree Treats You Can Trust Gluten Free Mini Cookies, Double Chocolate Chip, 5-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI am always thrilled to discover new whole grain products.  If they happen to be gluten-free, that's fine by me, although I do not have any special dietary requirements other than being vegetarian.  Honestly, it's probably best to eat a variety of different grains instead of sticking with the same one(s) all the time, anyway.\n\nThese are made with oat flour (from GF oats).  They're free from all common allergens except for soy, and they're also vegan.  If you have more than one allergy, it can be a bit hard to find any packaged foods that are OK for you to consume.  These, however, would be good even for multi-allergen households.\n\n7 cookies (a little bigger than the size of a quarter in diameter, and about 1/4 inch thick) make up one serving (150 calories).  Less than half the calories from these are from fat, which is nice, and the sodium is relatively low for a packaged food.  The fiber value is a bit low for a whole grain product, though.\n\nI'll admit these are not my favorites, as packaged cookies go.  But, I've never really liked hard or crispy cookies, so perhaps I am not the best judge of that.  Taste-wise, I would not have guessed these were GF or vegan if I hadn't had the package right in front of me (I regularly eat wheat, dairy, and eggs, so I am constantly reminded of what \"the real thing\" tastes like).  I did like the taste.\n\nPersonally, I would probably not buy these again simply because they're hard cookies (which, as explained above, is not my own preference).  However, because they did taste good, they did include whole grains, and because they cater to a variety of specific dietary needs, I'm still giving a fairly high rating.  It's hard to get all of those things together in one product.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBaker's Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate Squares, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nPlease note: this review is for the unsweetened baking chocolate squares, since multiple product listings are mixed together on this page.\n\nI like to bake and I make pretty much everything from scratch.  (No boxed mixes for me.)  Whenever I come across a recipe that calls for unsweetened chocolate, this is what I use.  It's pretty much guaranteed to work (or at least, it always has for me) and, being the easiest-to-find product of its type, it's likely what the recipe was developed with.  I actually have a difficult time finding any other brands of unsweetened chocolate locally.\n\nI have used lots of this in cakes, cookies, brownies, etc. -- all with success.  Another way I like to use it is in homemade yogurt.  I much prefer the flavor of unsweetened chocolate in homemade yogurt (just take about 2 ounces, chop it up, and let it melt in around a quart of scalded milk; let the milk cool and add yogurt starter, then put in a yogurt maker).\n\nPlease note: Baker's changed the packaging some time ago (I first started noticing around the holiday season last winter), cutting the amount of chocolate you get in half (i.e., the boxes are 4 oz. instead of 8 oz.).  So even though the newer packages contain less product, if you are wanting fresh chocolate, you'd be better off ordering the 4 oz. boxes (I've seen a lot of listings for the 8 oz. boxes on Amazon).  And you may want to check with any 3rd party sellers before purchase to clarify which you'll be getting.\n\nI'm not happy that Baker's makes it seem on the box like the new containers are improved because of the \"easy break\" bar.  (I preferred the individually-wrapped squares to the bar.)  However, this is still my go-to product for quality and availability reasons.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nMandy's Cookie Thins, Dark Chocolate, 4.6 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis review is actually for the chocolate flavor which is listed as \"currently unavailable\" but I really hope it comes back in stock soon because I like these a lot.  I am normally not a fan of packaged cookies but I got these in a subscription box and I figured I would give them a try.  And they are oddly satisfying.\n\nThe chocolate flavor is just at the perfect level.  These have a texture that is rather unlike other packaged cookie -- crunching and chewing them is somewhat reminiscent of a Ritz cracker, but not exactly.  They appear to be fairly stable in transit; I did not have any broken pieces in mind.  You can just about fit one whole cookie in your mouth without breaking it in half (though perhaps it looks a little rude to do so).\n\nYou can see the full ingredients list if you zoom in on the product image.  These contain wheat, milk, and soy ingredients and are processed in a facility that processes eggs and tree nuts, so watch out if you have any of those allergies.\n\nI'm not really going to bother with any kind of nutritional analysis.  These are cookies and are marketed as sweets so yes, they are somewhat high in sugar and lacking in protein and fiber, but they never made any claims to be health food.  Consume in moderation, maybe not every day, and you'll be fine.\n\nThese are crisp but not too hard or dense.  I think they would make excellent dunking cookies for some coffee, cocoa, or milk.  They are vegetarian (but not vegan, for reasons described above).  I am happy to have discovered this company and am interested in trying some of their other products now!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDoctor Kracker Organic Crispbread, Seeded Spelt, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI like these, but they're not for everyone.  They're quite a bit thicker than regular crackers so they are a little difficult to break and/or bite into.  On the other hand, because of that, they can stand up to heavier spreads and toppings without breaking, and they're much less likely to be damaged during shipping.\n\nThe taste is mostly neutral although, due to the presence of sesame seeds, these are going to be better in combination with savory toppings.  I tried (separately) Monterey Jack cheese and natural peanut butter, and both of those worked.  Sodium levels are intermediate, I'd say, but these are not overly salty.  You can see the full ingredients list and Nutrition Facts panel if you look at the product images.\n\nThese are fairly high in fiber, healthy fats (from the seeds and oils), and protein, plus they have a little iron.  They're whole grain, vegan, non-GMO, and organic, if any of those are important to you.  Spelt is a variety of wheat, though, so these are not gluten free.  The spelt flour and seeds, together, give these a \"rustic\" feel, so if you're looking for something softer or more refined, this is probably not what you want.  Since I've been eating whole grains pretty much exclusively for several years now, though, these are a texture I'm used to.  They're not greasy and don't leave oils on your fingers, but they are a little messy.  When you break or bite into them, seeds tend to fall off, so you should definitely eat them over a plate.\n\nI've been using these as part of the lunches I bring to work and I think they're great for that, since they're fairly healthful and since they're easily portable.  I can't rave about the taste (I really don't want to eat them on their own, without a topping), but they're about what I expected.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCrunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers, Sea Salt, 4.5 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese are a little hard compared to wheat crackers, but for a gluten free product, the texture is not bad.  These are pretty thin and they taste really salty.  So it is amazing to me that one serving only has 135 mg of sodium.  That's much lower than I expected based on taste (which is a good thing).\n\nI like how a lot of the grains in these are whole grains (i.e., brown rice flour, whole grain yellow corn) instead of just simple starches.  In my experience, starchy (and non-whole-grain) GF products are easier to come by than versions with some whole grains.  These are fairly low in fat and have a little fiber and protein.  You can see the full ingredients list and nutrition facts panel in the product images.\n\nBecause these are pretty salty, you would want to use savory spreads or dips if you are going that direction.  (And don't use anything that will conflict with the flavor of sesame seeds, because that is definitely noticeable here.)  Cheese and hummus would both be good.  These are also vegetarian.  And they don't stick in or on your teeth after eating, unlike some other crackers I've had lately!\n\nOverall, I love the flavor and the texture is something I can live with.  Even though I don't need to eat GF, I would seriously consider buying these again.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Almonds, Low Sodium Lightly Salted, 6 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI normally buy the Whole Foods store brand almonds to eat as a snack at work, and I probably still will after trying these.  These (I'm reviewing the \"lightly salted\" kind, since this page covers multiple products) are OK but nothing really special for me.\n\nThey do have a little bit of a lower salt level than the almonds I'm used to, and that is a definite benefit, especially if you are watching your sodium intake.  Despite the \"lightly salted\" label, you CAN still taste the salt.  Which is good, because I think I would have a hard time eating plain almonds without salt.  So the low sodium is definitely a benefit.\n\nHowever, the almonds, themselves, are really quite small, as almonds go.  And despite the fact that my usual almonds -- like these -- are also roasted in oil, these are a bit oilier and have a larger proportion of calories from fat than my usual almonds.\n\nIn the end, the health benefits of nuts are well-established -- protein, fiber, healthy fats, vitamin E, iron, etc.  If you have a Whole Foods near you, you should give their roasted and salted almonds a try (they're often on sale).  But if you don't have access to Whole Foods or a similar store, or if you are watching your sodium intake, these Blue Diamond lightly salted almonds might work for you.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It's also incredibly easy to make -- just bake it in a pie plate after following directions to mix the dough with egg, water and oil.  We recommend adding lots of caraway seeds to the dough before baking -- lovely!!

And you can buy this and many other cereals in single-serving envelopes that you then cook in your own utensils.\n\nSo why go with these?\n\nBecause they're so incredibly easy.  And because something that's easy gets done more often than something that's not.\n\nI used to buy these with delight in my local grocery store -- always had them on hand.  More mornings than not, I'd have one of these, either before leaving for work or once I got there.  It would always hold me until lunch or later, without any impulse to snack in the morning.  Maybe a couple of times a week, I'd have another one for a snack in the afternoon or evening, just because it was so easy -- almost as easy as the pint of ice cream I'd have rather had but which would have been much less good for me (and even easier than EasyMac!).\n\nThen I couldn't find them at any local grocery store for years.  So I'd occasionally buy a new box of the instant envelopes, having thrown out the old box before ever finishing it.  There they sat, unwanted and forlorn, until they too got tossed.\n\nThese aren't the best diet food or health food, and they certainly aren't ecologically wise.  But they work.  They're easy enough that they'll substitute for even less good choices (such as a take-out breakfast sandwich -- erghhhh).  And they're satisfying -- you really feel you've had something when you finish scraping out the last of the bowl just as it is (no need to add anything).\n\nI even looked for them occasionally on Amazon but could never find them.  Imagine my surprise when I googled them tonight in a sudden mad urge to go farther if necessary to stock up on them again, only to discover Amazon has them after all!  And on Subscribe-and-Save, no less!  Awesome.\n\nMy case is on its way.  If you decide to try one, I think you'll be as happy as I am.  We're all in luck!!!  :)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBiscoff Cookies, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 5)\nReview:\nOh, I'm so glad to have found these on Amazon!  Our local independent grocer carries them during the holidays, and we just finished the last of the ones we've been hoarding since last December.  These have a very soft, pleasant taste that grows on you.  One of these shortly before bedtime makes me feel calm, relaxed and quite self-indulgent, although they're actually more nutritious than you might think.  A very desirable item to stock in the pantry for last-minute entertaining, or to bring along when visiting a sick friend or a shut-in.  They're actually good for settling a shaky stomach (must be the ginger and/or cinnamon?!), which may be one reason Delta gives them out as in-flight snacks.  They're fabulous with a dish of ice cream or fresh fruit, or with port,  brandy, cream sherry or a liqueur after dinner.  They work well as an item for elegant receptions.  We like to offer them at dinner parties along with coffee and dessert.  Unlike many cookies, they go as well with morning, afternoon or evening tea as with coffee, and of course they're marvelous on their own.  I just ordered 2 packs of 5 and will be ordering more before those are gone.  Hooray!  If you haven't tried them yet, maybe you'd like to: I bet you'll love them as much as we do!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBiscoff Cookies, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 5)\nReview:\nOh, I'm so glad to have found these on Amazon!

My husband actually prefers them cold and drinks them for breakfast, lunch, dinner or late-night snack with total delight.  Great to grab when running off without time to eat, or when planning to be away.  Ideal for travel or emergency stash, because no refrigeration required, not even a microwave for reheating if you're like my husband and enjoy them cold!  We have 2 cases a month on Subscribe-and-Save and go through them pretty fast.  Their nutritional profile isn't as bad as you might think (at least according to Weight Watchers), and they're very satisfying.  If you're craving a late-night snack, think:  would you be better off with cookies/candy/chips or with tomato soup??

Not really so great, as it turns out.  We probably WILL use the remainder as reviewers also suggested to flavor rices, couscous etc. where you don't need a whole quart and the smaller size is convenient.  But the taste, on its own, just isn't too pleasant.  My husband and I tried them  separately on the same day.  I was surprised how awful mine tasted but resolved not to say anything in case he liked his.  When he got home, I asked how was the wonderful new broth, and he said \"AWFUL!\".  So that was that.\n\nIncidentally, if you are looking for two absolutely great-tasting vegetable broths (both of which my husband will drink up all by himself, right from the box, all 32-oz.!), try these:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wolfgang-Puck-All-Natural-Vegetable-Cooking-Stock-32-Ounce-Packages-Pack-of-12/dp/B0029TJRE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wolfgang Puck All Natural Vegetable Cooking Stock, 32-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>&nbsp;-- fabulous for drinking and cooking -- use in place of beef or chicken broth, too (and just available again on subscribe-and-save).\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pacific-Natural-Foods-Mushroom-32-Ounce-Pack-of-12/dp/B001HTE08G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pacific Natural Foods Mushroom, 32-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>&nbsp;-- extraordinary -- the broth par excellence for mushroom soup, but great for absolutely anything -- world class (though currently out of stock -- should be available again soon).\n\nHope this helps.

They're very crispy with a decent amount of dark chocolate, not too \"killer\" for dieters (Weight Watchers points value for 1 bar: 4 pts; for 2 bars: 7 pts).\n\nThey not very big, and don't offer a lot of protein or fiber, but they ARE tasty, slightly sweet, slightly salty, crunchy.  I didn't detect much almond flavor; I tasted more peanuts than anything.\n\nBasically, I like these OK, but given a choice, I'd probably opt for something with more fiber than these, and more filling.  These are just too much like \"candy\" for my taste.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S GOLDEN ALMOND Chocolate Bar, Roasted Almonds in Fine Milk Chocolate Candy Bar, Individually Wrapped Bars in Gift Box, 14 Ounce Box\nReview:\nI'm an unrepentant chocoholic, and I'm usually an equal-opportunity chocoholic, meaning I'll eat just about anything that isn't pure drek.  Hershey's is a decent brand, with generally good products, not as good as some brands, but probably better than others.  So I kind of knew what to expect with these almond chocolate bars.\n\nYou get 5 large-ish milk chocolate bars with just the right amount of crunchy almonds.  Each bar breaks into 8 nuggets -- reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hershey-s-Nuggets-Milk-Chocolate-with-Almonds-12-Ounce-Bags-Pack-of-4/dp/B001FA1DZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hershey's Nuggets, Milk Chocolate with Almonds, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>.  Yes, the quality is consistent with Hershey's brand -- creamy, a bit sweet (it is, after all, milk chocolate), etc.  The gift box is nice.  But at the current price (twenty-five dollars) it's just not very economical, especially when you check out other options.  If this were Scharffen Berger or Guittard quality, it might be worth the extra cost.  But for Hershey's?  You be the judge.  Only you know if it's worth it to you.  I'll pass.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nStella D'Oro Cookies, Almond Delight, 9 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI've purchased a few Stella D'oro varieties over the years but haven't been a steady customer, so I really don't have much to compare these to as far as taste/quality over a period of time.\n\nI do know that I like these.  Probably not enough to put them on subscribe and save, but enough to purchase again occasionally.\n\nFirst things first: these are not overly sweet and they're rather dry, so it's clear they're intended to be eaten with coffee or tea or even wine.  The flavor is there -- vanilla in some, lemon in others, chocolate -- but it's very subtle.  The icing and sprinkles really bring nothing to the party -- the icing is a thin \"smear,\" without flavor.  But flavor and \"mouth feel\" are overall pleasant.  They're also quite \"sturdy\" -- mine survived transport in less than optimum exterior packaging without a single broken cookie.  Seriously -- not a one broke.  Even with that, they're still tender - not \"hard\" and crunchy at all.  And you do get quite a lot of them -- they come in a plastic tray that is 9.5\" x 5.5\" x 2\" that is filled full.\n\nAs I said, I'll likely order these sometime in the future, possibly adding them into my \"cookie rotation\" of brands/types that I like to purchase occasionally.  Definitely worth 4 stars: I like them.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nOliveNation Honey Roasted Sesame Chips, 8 Ounce\nReview:\nLike others, I'm sure, I first tasted these in a \"pub mix\" blend of pretzel stix, cheese twists, and rice treats.  It was love at first taste, and I spent some time trying to find a source for just these sesame chips.  Tried a couple of other options, but this is the clear winner!  It comes closest to the taste of the sesame treats in the pub mix -- a little salty, a little sweet, and a tender \"crunch\" that is ... well ... just about perfect.\n\nI eat them \"straight up,\" of course, but one of my favorite ways to use them is in my own savory trail mix:  these crackers, mini pretzels, cheeze crackers (or goldfish crackers), honey roasted almonds, and corn chex cereal.  I usually have a couple of bowls of this out for cocktail parties and it always goes over well.\n\nWill continue to purchase these as long as they're still available.  These OliveNation chips have the best flavor and definitely are the freshest tasting.

Well, there went the diet, big time. The milk chocolate is creamy goodness, and the toffee chips and finely chopped almonds add just the right amount of sweet slightly salty crunch. These are absolutely addictive, and I have to seriously limit my consumption if I have any hope of staying on track diet-wise. Will definitely keep these around -- despite the temptation.

We liked both flavors, probably preferred the dark chocolate, but found both to have a nice balance of mint to chocolate. The crushed peppermint candy bits in the white chocolate top add a nice crunch, too.\n\nThe price here is very good, too.

These were the first I had eaten in some years as I prefer liquid center cordials.  The chocolate is very good, the cherry firm, the center a tasty mixture of liquid and creme fondant and the texture pleasing,  but they are very sweet.  I decided to buy a box of dark chocolate cordials to see if, perhaps, they would be less sweet.  As expected, they are less sweet than the milk chocolate variety but still very sweet.  These are not the cordials which most people would enjoy snacking on, one piece is enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.

Instead, it is almost a thick soup. It is good as is but was better when I drained a can of beans and made a quick succotash. It would make a good starter for a variety of other dishes including gumbo. Well seasoned out of the can, I like a little more salt and spice so added a little Tony's All Purpose Creole Seasoning.

There is a potential problem with sodium deficiency if you eat too many foods low in sodium (that can cause muscle cramps, especially in your legs).\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSimply7 Quinoa Chips, Gluten Free, Barbeque, 3.5 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese chips have a nice flavor, and the Amazon price is lower than local grocery stores.  The problem has been noted by other reviewers.  The manufacturer has lowered his costs by loading them with potato starch which adds nothing except calories.  If I want potato chips, I will buy potato chips.  There are 140 calories per ounce, with only 1 gram of protein and 1 gram of fiber.  In comparison, Beanitos Pinto Bean chips have the same calories, but have 4 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber (with zero potato starch). per ounce.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I looked forward to giving this a try as I scale back on sugar before the holidays.

Sugar is 28g, though the label doesn't indicate any is added so hopefully that's all natural from the oranges.  What gets me about this Tropicana Orange Juice is consistency between cases.  I got one case that tasted perfect, but the very next case was thick and off.  It even had 3 months on the expiration date so that wasn't the issue.

This pack is great for use in freezers, which I mainly use it for, to help cut down on the freezer burn smell that can collect on bags and containers.\n\nWhen thirty days are up, you can pop open the top and use the baking soda for various cleaning purposes, although it wouldn't be useful for cooking purposes.  I have even refilled the package with fresh baking soda from a bigger container and sealed the top back and gotten the same results as if I had used a new fridge/freezer package.

This has not happened to me since I ate some really greasy spicy chicken wings for lunch at work in 1993. I spit it into a paper towel, it was orange grease, I fear the same orange grease that rises to the top of most other canned chili's that I am able to mostly skim-off  This chili showed very little solid grease at the top, I could not quickly remove it, so I didn't. I suspect it had just as much but was emulsified into the thicker sauce, which I ended up eating and then regurgitating because my body could not digest it. I wish I hadn't eaten it.

That is not an overstatement. He has been looking for a carbonated drink that has really sugar in it, is lightly sweetened and the flavor is light as well. He thinks the cherry flavor is great. I am not a huge fan of cherry overall (something to do with cherry flavored cough syrup as a child), and this drink did leave me with a distinctive cherry aftertaste that brought on some unpleasant flashbacks. I would love to try the ginger or vanilla flavors at some point.\n\nIngredients are simply purified carbonated water, pure can sugar, natural flavor and phosphoric acid. It is Non gmo verified. Each can has 60 calories and 15 grams of sugar. Nicely designed cans look pretty at a picnic, bar-b-que or in a lunch box.  Also, mixes well with spirits.

In fact, chilling it causes it to harden.  It is good for 30 days once opened.  Pump is packed separately in box with creamer. However, it is designed so that you cannot remove it once it is screwed on to creamer container. This is for health and safety reasons.\n\nCreamer has an excellent sweet cream taste, equivalent to adding half-and-half and sugar to your java. This 21.1 oz. bottle contains 125 servings. Each serving is equal to one single serve creamer.  I think typically people who like cream in coffee add 2-3 single creamers to a cup of coffee, so this container will last for 40- 60 cups of coffee.\n\nReally perfect if you are having company over the holidays, have a large household, small office, business or church.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Praline Pecans Stand-Up, Resealable Bag, 5.5 oz\nReview:\nAddictive.

I liked them all.  The peanut butter chocolate chip was the most \"desserty\" flavor of the bunch with a few chocolate chips in the bar.  The Cherries and Berries had some nice dried fruit chunks in it and a nutty sesame taste.  The Granola with Coconut tasted exactly as the name implies.  I will likely purchase the variety pack again instead of the single flavor boxes.  They do not have a lot of protein and are somewhat high in fat, are very moist and chewy, so they aren't what I am used to from my meal replacement bars (I really like Zone Perfect Fudge Graham bars - my kids also like them which is a bonus and a decent after school/before sports snack that transports easily in backpacks and sports bags).

Figured I'd have myself a little truff party.  Well let me tell you, it's been a 2-week non-stop party in my mouth.  And you can be invited!  Well I guess the party would be in your mouth, but I digress.\n\nMy kitchen now smells like Umamiville, USA.  This is some seriously pungent stuff.  Mrs. Philyodaddy put the three aforementioned products in one drawer, which she started calling the truffle drawer (very clever lady that Mrs. P).  More like flavor country.\n\nSo far I have applied small doses of this product on: sandwiches, steak, salmon, other fish, cheese, chicken, pork, lamb, my finger, and other animals I cannot currently think of.  Everything was improved.  As you can see, I have an extremely healthy diet.  I might be going off the deep end a little, because Mrs. Philyodaddy is \"getting sick of truffles\".  Like that's possible.  Hey Mrs. P, maybe you should get sick of expensive purses or renttherunway.\n\nThe ratio is 95 parts salt for 5 parts truffle, not that I could tell.  It seems that there is real black truffle in as well as some sort of truffle flavor, but this is my first truffle salt, so I don't know if that's par for the truffcourse.  I would say, of the three truffle related products I've tried so far I like the salt the best, and a little goes a long way.  Try it out, unless you don't like delicious things.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHuy Fong - Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (Net Wt. 17 Oz.) - 3 Pack\nReview:\nSriracha, while hard to spell, makes everything taste better.

Each little tiny bag has about a dozen or so tiny bite-sized bits.  Each bag has 150 calories, over one-third of those FAT and 24 more simple sugar carbs to boot, and 8 calories of protein, as well.  8 calories of protein.  8.\n\nThe label on the box says,  \"16 grams of whole grains and no artificial flavors, sweeteners, or colors.\"  So, you kind of think you are making a healthy choice.  And you are wrong.  You are feeding your child pure diabetes in bite-sized bits.  The fat comes primarily from Canola oil.  AND, WHAT IS Canola oil?  It's like Canadian Oil because they invented it and now 90% is a Monsanto creation.  Enough said about that?\n\nI didn't see an age on here, but toddlers and youngers have an added danger of choking, these are pretty small bits - see the picture I included.\n\nMy son sat down to try a bag of these, I gave him one pouch to each.  He ended up finding the box and then eating the ENTIRE BOX.  6 in a box x 150 calories each pouch = 900 calories.  O.M.G. and then he went on to eat his regular lunch.  Granted the kid is super skinny but NO CHILD NEEDS 900 calories in one sitting.\n\nI am not a big fan of these.

Since there are always figs in my pantry I was able to directly compare these to the usual California brands that I purchase.\n\nFirst, these are completely different. They are large, soft and moist in the center, and slightly sticky on the outside. Even the premium California figs I purchase locally seem mummified compared to these. The size is another factor - these are much larger.\n\nSecond, these have a natural sweetness that exceeds the California ones. Indeed, it comes close to the over ripe fresh figs of which I am fond when they are in season. Of course, there is nothing to my palate that compares to a fresh fig, but these will do nicely when the fresh ones are not in season.\n\nI did a quick taste test when I was comparing these using a few cheeses and a wine samples to augment the flavors. I found that the sweetness of these figs is prefect paired with pecorino romano (a very strong cheese of sheep milk), while the California fig against which I tested it was bland and overpowered. The three wines I tried were an Italian white (Gavi), a California red (pinor noir) and an Italian red (valpolicella ripasso). This fig went well with the Gavi and valpolicella, but not the pinot. The California fig was so tasteless in comparison that it went with (but was not enhanced by) all three wines. My conclusion is paring a contrasting cheese - especially a strong one - with either a crisp, dry white or heavier, dry red wine is a perfect match. I mention this because for cheese and wine sampling parties this is perfect for serving after the tasting because the high fiber will counter the tendency of the cheese to constipate guests.\n\nAdditional factors: the figs do not look exactly like those in the product images (at the time of this review). They are actually larger and flatter; and, the complete nutritional information in on the product photo of the actual container so I am not going to repeat it here. Also, the containers are relatively small (but this is a three pack, so the pricing is still competitive with my locally purchased ones). They are approximately four inches in diameter by two inches high. Finally, the packaging recommends that you refrigerate these after opening them. I do not - they dry out the figs. I store mine in a tightly sealed glass container in my pantry.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCinnamon Organic Saigon - Fine Powder - Naturally Sweet Flavor - Perfect for Cinnamon Rolls, Apple Pie, Baking, Smoothies - Unprocessed &amp; Hand Harvested - 100% Satisfaction\nReview:\nCompared to cinnamon sticks and the usual grocery store fare Saigon cinnamon is potent, more aromatic and literally explodes with flavor.\n\nUse two thirds of what you would normally use or it will be bitter. In fact, like other brands I have tried this is fresh and potent enough to get by with a half of what you would normally use. You can always add a pinch more, but cannot remove it. Experiment if you have never used this Vietnamese spice because it's definitely like cinnamon on steroids. I use this mixed with either honey or unsweetened applesauce as a topping on baked sweet potatoes. I also add a pinch to coffee grounds before brewing when I want a special treat.\n\nThis does NOT come in sticks because the nature of the bark from which this comes is too delicate to harvest in stick form. On the other hand, I have never had a cinnamon stick that came close to flavor and fragrance as this stuff, so do not let the powdered form fool you into thinking that there is something better out there. There isn't.\n\nIf you cook or bake with cinnamon and have never experienced this variety it's definitely worth checking out.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDancing Moon Sumatra Mandheling Whole Bean Organic Fair Trade Antioxidant Coffee, 2 lbs.\nReview:\nI received this as a free review sample to try after criticizing the roast of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Dancing-Moon-Ethiopian-Yirgacheffe/dp/B00TXMKZBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Dancing Moon Ethiopian Yirgacheffe</a>, which I thought was over roasted. This one is perfectly roasted for the bean type. It's dark (the Sumatra Mandheling is best that way), but not oily, which would indicate over roasting.\n\nThe flavor was typical Mandheling, with a full, rich body, low acidity and complex with earthy dominating, but a touch of sweet and - to my palate - an ineffable flavor that I cannot identify, but lingers in a pleasant way.\n\nWhen I test coffee I have a specific process. I always grind with a manual, ceramic burr grinder so as to not burn or burnish the beans, and I use a bottled water (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Acqua-Panna/dp/B004AHBH38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acqua Panna</a>) when brewing because that water is totally neutral. Sadly that water is too expensive for daily brewing, but it contributes to a perfect cup of coffee. I also brew two ways: in a French Press and in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bialetti-6799-Moka-Express-3-Cup-Stovetop-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0000CF3Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bialetti 6799 Moka Express 3-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a>. This particular bean and grind brewed perfectly in both. I had expected a better brew from the French press, but surprisingly the moka did an equally nice job. In fact that brewer brought out nuances that the French press did not.\n\nMy only complaint is there is no roast date on the bag. There is a 'use by' sticker, but that does not tell you how long ago it has been roasted - and is important to we coffee fanatics.\n\nBottom line: I loved this particular bean and roast so much that I will probably be ordering a bag every few months - it's that good.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nViva Naturals Organic Quinoa, 4 LB - 100% Royal Bolivian Whole Grain\nReview:\nI received a bag of this as a review sample and had other quinoa in my pantry to which to compare against. The grains in this bag were dry, fresh and had a slightly grassy flavor when I tasted a few grains. In contrast, the other brand I have in my pantry was not as pleasant to the palate (raw). The grains in this bag were smaller and more uniform as well.\n\nThis one soaked and cooked about five minutes quicker as well, compared to the brand I had been using.\n\nAs for the claims that this is non-GMO I have no way to verify that, but it's an important feature for me. I endeavor to eat only natural foods that are as pure as possible.\n\nOther reviewers have provided recipes and other information, so I will not repeat them. I will say that I've\\ been eating quinoa for years because it is healthier on my system than most other grains. This is one of the higher quality bags that I have some across and I do know the difference. If you are exploring the health benefits there is plenty of information on the web. If you already consume quinoa this is truly a quality grain that is noticeably better than bulk bags (and even the giant plastic jars that some brands use).\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nThai Kitchen Fish Sauce, 6.76 oz\nReview:\nI can purchase this locally from a number of sources, including the dominant supermarket chain in Central Florida. Therefore my review will focus on this fish sauce and not address price or shipping.\n\nNot all fish sauces are created equal. I spent a lot of my life in Asia and was first introduced to this in the Philippines where it's called patis. This is identical to a high quality patis in all respects.  Do be aware that this, like patis or other Thai brands, is extremely high in sodium. A single gram of this sauce contains 890mg. That means that a teaspoon contains a whopping 4450mg, so use it very sparingly if you have sodium restrictions.\n\nMy main use is to chop fresh bird's eye peppers and make a combination dipping sauce and condiment that is called phrik nam pla in Thai. It's also delicious by itself on on grilled eggplant and zucchini, and especially pork (which I have not eaten in decades but did enjoy with this sauce when I did consume it.)  Actually, this is perfect on mixed grilled or fried vegetables and will enhance many dishes if used in lieu of salt or soy sauce.\n\nBottom line: this is a quality fish sauce that is identical to patis and the equal of any brand I have used.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nThai Kitchen Fish Sauce, 6.76 oz\nReview:\nThis is identical to the the top brands of the Philippine version called patis. It has the same purity and flavor, and can easily compete with my other favorite brand made by Tiparos. I switched to this brand mainly for convenience when I discovered it on a shelf at my local grocery store. That was a shock in itself, but a pleasant one.\n\nI use this - sparingly - on grilled eggplant and zucchini, and to make a hot dipping sauce called nam pra prik. That sauce can be easily made by finely chopping hot peppers (bird's eye chillies are the best) and adding them to this fish sauce.\n\nAlthough I haven't eaten pork in decades this was a perfect condiment for it when I did.  The flavor of mixed grilled or fried vegetables is also greatly enhanced by using a few drops of this in lieu of salt or soy sauce.\n\nDo be aware that this, like patis or other Thai brands, is extremely high in sodium. A single gram of this sauce contains 890mg. That means that a teaspoon contains a whopping 4450mg, so use it very sparingly if you have sodium restrictions.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nJoyfuel Organic Raw Cacao Powder, Rich Dark Chocolate, 16 Ounce (1 lb) Bag\nReview:\nWhen I received this as a review sample I just had to try a little on my finger. It had that rich, slightly bitter taste of an excellent grade of cacao. I stirred a little into a cup of coffee and it complemented it perfectly. I was impressed by how easily it dissolved into the brew as though it were sugar. But know that it's anything but sweet (no quality cacao is).\n\nI know that this is supposed to have health benefits, some of which I know first hand from using cacao for quite some time. I have not had this long enough to say one way or the other. What I can say, though, is I have tried a lot of cacao in my life and this one is everything the product description claims as far as quality goes. In fact, if you make mole poblano from scratch, you'll appreciate this because it has a richness that you will not find in grocery store cacao or cocoa.\n\nThe reason why I awarded this five stars are it is genuine Criollo, it's non GMO (a big deal for me), and the intense flavor and characteristic bitter aftertaste. If you do a lot of gourmet cooking using cacao this is worth every penny. If you are looking for the health benefits, I am not going to make claims other than to say that this is an exceptionally high quality grade. For me it's going to be a cooking ingredient, something to enrich after dinner coffee for me and guests, and as a sprinkle over confections made with mascapone cheese. I am sure I'll think of other uses, but when this runs out I am purchasing another bag.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

But honestly, with all the nutrition, they have wanted to take a step back and try to do something in the way with what Slim-Fast had done for so many years, and try to make a leaner drink line for your life. This honestly is a nice stepping stone with their 100 calorie smart nutritional drink tastes not too shabby, and has just as much taste as the regular line of nutritional supplemental drinks. What I do like about it is that they do taste great in chocolate drinks. The sincere bad news is that you only get 4 bottles, rather than 6 unlike their lines of other drinks from their supplemental line.

Fortunately, Healthy Choice makes a nice arrangement of taste and quality with their soups. Their Zesty Gumbo soup however, isn't one of their best flavors. While the soup does blend in a unique blend of chicken, rice celery and flavor, there unfortunately lacks a bit of spice in the flavor by not adding enough garlic or zest from onions or cheese to the taste of the tongue. On top of that, it also lacks by not adding enough sausage in the gumbo, unlike Cambell's Chunky or Progresso's Chicken & Sausage Gumbo. It isn't a bad soup for the price if you're health-smart, but at least it is better than Cambell's putting sea salt in their lower sodium soups.

It is delicious after the first cup, and just everlasting. My one and only gripe with Melitta though is that with their ground coffees is that they are very hard to open the cans, considering you'd have to use a regular can opener to get them open, rather than peel the top off from Folgers or Maxwell House. That definitely is the only thing that is not only frustrarting, but can easily cause the consumer to break the can.

The lemon and ginger are strong flavors, and the tea color is far darker than most lemon ginger teas I've had.

Maybe this finer grinding allows more flavor to be brewed into the cup.\n\nI like it plain when it's hot and with honey for a sweeter taste when served as iced tea.\n\nIf you're fond of citrus and ginger, you'll like this tea.  The convenience of the single serving cups is an added bonus.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nL&Auml;RABAR Renola Grain-Free Granola, Cocoa Coconut, 1.18 oz, 15 Pack\nReview:\nI write this with the perspective of someone who does not NEED non-gluten, non-soy, low sodium foods.  It's simply the opinion of someone who enjoys delicious foods and snacks.  Larabar's Renola is a tasty granola substitute for those who are looking for a non-wheat granola product.\n\nHowever, when I eat granola, I want crunch and this doesn't have it.  It does have almonds, pecans, cashews, sunflower and pumpkin  seeds and you'd expect a wonderfully crunchy texture from them, but maybe the fruit (raisins) and tapioca syrup soften them.\n\nThe flavor is sweet (dried molasses) and satisfying for a sweet tooth urge.  The cinnamon is mild and tasty, too.  They make the nuggets taste good.\n\nThe 200 calories for a 1.25 oz. serving seems awfully high, especially when 130 of them come from fat.  Unless you are desperate for a tiny splurge, I can think of better ways to consume 10% of the USDA's recommended daily allotment of a 2,000 calorie diet.  Please understand, if your needs are for non-gluten, this can more than meet your desire for a quick snack.  But, if you can partake of other options, I'd take a pass on this product.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Honey Roasted Peanuts, Golden Roast, 14 oz\nReview:\nThese FISHER Honey Dry Roast Peanuts are delicious!

Let me tell you why I bought it.  I wanted to make a pastry (almond crescents/horns) that requires one pound of almond paste.  At my local supermarket this sells for nearly $1/ounce--far too costly!  I looked at Amazon's price and determined that I could make almond paste for less than half that price.\n\nThe box came well-packaged and swiftly with Amazon Prime delivery.  I made two pounds of almond paste from just one bag of almond flour and will freeze the second pound for making marzipan.  The remaining three bags are stored in freezer bags in my freezer and will eventually be used in pie crusts, cookies, etc.\n\nThe almond flour blended perfectly with the other ingredients and produced an excellent paste.  The quality was very good; there were no dark spots (from almond skins), the flour had no lumps and appeared to be fresh.\n\nThis is a brand you can rely on and I do--again and again.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBelly Flops (Irregular Jelly Beans) by Jelly Belly - 2 lb Bag; 32 oz\nReview:\nIf you've eaten Jelly Belly beans, you know how tasty they are.  Each tiny 'bean' is a colorful burst of gummy flavor.  In this package, you will find the appropriately named mistakes, 'Belly Flops'.  These are the beans that didn't meet production standards for size, shape, or perhaps, became stuck to another bean--twins, how yummy.  There's absolutely no difference in taste, just their appearance.  Each two-pounds bag contains a delicious, large variety of flavors of these cute, little beans.\n\nWhether you buy them for yourself or, give them as a gift, they're sure to bring smiles of appreciation.  We mix the 'Flops' with the regular beans.  When scooping up a handful you'll never know what surprises you may encounter, making this treat even more fun to eat.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Praline Pecans Stand-Up, Resealable Bag, 5.5 oz\nReview:\nFISHER's Roasted Salted Pecans are scrumptious!

These nuts are good to eat right out of the re-sealable package and can be stored for future snacking without their becoming soggy.\n\nA serving size is 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup) and contains 200 calories.  The problem is that they're so good, it's hard to stop with one serving.\n\nThe pecans are good on salads, on top of ice cream and I've even tried baking chocolate chip cookies with them.  Just use unsalted butter and add about half of the salt your usual recipe calls for.  I put these FISHER's Roaste4d Salted Pecans out for company with dried fruits, cheeses, and crackers.  Everyone complimented the nuts first.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I question the labeling as Organic Superfood because I do not consider any sugar to be a superfood, but in moderation, if you are going to use sugar, this is one to consider.  The color of the sugar is brown, the texture is moist and fine.  It doesn't clump as quickly as brown sugar, but I haven't had an opened bag around long enough for that to occur.  Each pound is in a sturdy resealable bag and there's an interesting recipe on the back of the bag which I intend to try.  If this is your first experience with coconut sugar, don't be misled by the very white packaging and expect the product to be white like the coconut flesh represented on the package.

They seem to be expensive, though, for non-Organic walnut halves.  I bake a lot and have an ample supply of walnuts, pecans and almonds at the very least in the pantry and freezer. Seriously, I must go through a pound or two a week. I recently opened another brand's sealed and \"fresh\" bag of walnuts that were rancid, so I will never buy that brand again. These, on the other hand, were delicious straight out of the bag. I'm using these nuts in their out of the bag unchopped form and will use my other favorite bag for recipes requiring smaller pieces. These are especially tasty when baked and bitten into while warm, as the flavors and oils come forward. They are also excellent when spiced as a snack with cocktails! I prefer pecans over walnuts, but I tend to look for quality nuts at a reasonable price and would repurchase these if the price was right.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNavitas Organics Cacao Nibs, 8 oz.

When out of cocoa powder, I needed to bake a batch of Alice Medrich's Best Cocoa Brownies for an event and was short on time.  Remembering the cacao powder in the cupboard, I took a chance and was rewarded with a batch of brownies that drew more compliments than ever before, and I'm always praised for the brownies I bake.  They were especially bittersweet and didn't require the addition of espresso powder which I often add to chocolate baked recipes.  The ultra fudgy brownies were great with nuts, without nuts, and in the fresh batch I baked yesterday, I brought out the chocolate flavor the best so far with the addition of rehydrated cherries, cranberries and chopped figs.  I'd recommend thinking out of the box with this cacao powder and although it may lose some of the nutritional benefits with cooking, it sure does produce great baked goods if you are willing to taste your batter, adjust as necessary, and take a chance.  The above mentioned recipe was a perfect use because the cacao powder is cooked with butter and sugar initially and that's used instead of the typical chocolate chunks in brownie recipes.  Oh yes, in all recipes, I also added some chocolate chips -- found the extra bitter chips weren't as good as the semi-sweet because of the natural bitterness of the cacao powder.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBobo's Oat Bar (Banana Chocolate Chip, 12 Pack of 3 oz Bars) Gluten Free Whole Grain Rolled Oat Bar - Great Tasting Vegan On-The-Go Snack, Made in the USA\nReview:\nI've purchased 4 boxes of Bobo's Oat Bars in the Chocolate variety from Amazon in the past month.  An acquaintance had told me how delicious they were, so I took a chance and purchased my first box before I embarked on a trip, planning to take some along for the journey.  Unfortunately for my wallet, every person but one to whom I gave a bar loved these, so I sent some a box to enjoy.  Prior to my first purchase, I did not realize these are soft, sort of brownie like in texture, a little sweet in a molasses sort of way (no molasses in the recipe, though), crumbly, and with two servings in a single bar.  Fortunately, I placed a bar in a small resealable plastic bag for the airplane trip, so I was able to break off a little piece any time I felt hungry.  That bag was a saving grace because when a bar was gone, I replaced it with another and you won't believe how often I pulled out that little bag.  I ordered the first box as a gift after I put a little bite into my father's mouth while he was busy enjoying himself at a slot machine and I realized that he needed to keep these on hand for him and Mom to have on the days they go out.  For those who have few teeth, these are edible because of the soft texture, yet they provide an enjoyable flavor.  Hiker's took these along for a day trip, not worrying about the double serving per package, happily eating the entire bar.  As they put it, they felt like they had a brownie along for the trek, much more enjoyable than other bars they'd taken in the past.  One sister has enjoyed these on days when she's been unable to break for lunch at work, having them with coffee or tea and some deep breaths.  Without eggs, butter or flour, they are terrific, even though Earth Balance has never been my favorite flavor.  I'll admit that I was expecting a firmer bar with visible chocolate chips, but after the surprise of a crumbly moist baked good with a not very sweet cocoa flavor, I was hooked.  I will gladly try the other varieties when I can find them for a lower cost than over two dollars per bar.  A retail value of about thirty dollars is too high for a dozen bars, so I've deducted a star from this review.  The one friend who did not love her Bobo's Oat Bar thought it tasted like cardboard and she claimed to have forced it down at work.  She loves the SOYJOY bars which I do not care for, so I guess the world is balanced.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Certified Organic, non-GMO, Vegan Hazelnut Spread with Cocoa, Chia and Flaxseed, Classic Chocolate, 13-ounce\nReview:\nI prefer the darkest, most bitter chocolates. Hazelnuts are a favorite, but I love nearly all nuts if they are fresh. Sugar seldom entices me, but watch out if a bag of savory snacks is opened in the house.\n\nThe nutiva organic hazelnut spread surprised me because the 13 ounce jar is smaller than I imagined it would be. The information on the label appealed to me because the product is organic, non GMO, gluten-free, vegan, and it contains 12 grams of sugar in 2 tablespoons which is more than I will use at a time. The calories in that serving ar 210 with 15 grams of fat. It has no cholesterol. In this spread that contains 40% less sugar than the leading brand which we all know is Nutella, the first ingredient is cane sugar. I'm surprised to read that this may contain traces of milk solids which to me says it would not be vegan, but what do I know? I again was surprised when I opened the jar of classic organic hazelnut spread with cocoa and after prying off the seal, discovered a very thin product which I tried to stir with a very fancy spoon. There was nothing solid at the bottom of the jar, it was all the same thin consistency which reminded me of Hershey's syrup from years ago. I coated the spoon and tasted this product only to discover that I love it. It is not overly sweet and the cocoa comes through clearly with a very strong hazelnut aftertaste. There are no synthetic additives in this fair trade certified product of the United States. It is recommended that this not be refrigerated even after opening the jar which makes it much easier to keep in an office setting inside a desk drawer for quick access. I think it's that good.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKIND Bars, Dark Chocolate Nuts &amp; Sea Salt, Gluten Free, 1.4 Ounce Bars, 12 Count\nReview:\nI received the package of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/KIND-Nuts-Spices-Dark-Chocolate-Nuts-Sea-Salt-12-Count-Bars/dp/B007PE7ANY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">KIND Nuts & Spices, Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt, 12-Count Bars</a>&nbsp;in the early evening, so it had been sitting in the shipper's truck all day in the heat.  Unfortunately, when I opened the package, each bar was soft because the chocolate was melted and sticking to the wrapper.  Regardless, when brought back to a temperature closer to the 80 degree range, I eagerly tore open a cellophane package and carefully peeled it back to try my first KIND bar.  With the first bite, I was impressed by the great flavor of fresh nuts and simple dark chocolate, even after exposed to the environmental heat.  On the second bite, I was hit with the sea salt, making me think about how smart it is to add sea salt instead of using salted nuts which I sometimes do when making chocolate covered nuts.  That creates an inconsistent salt burst which I find appealing.  At the small size of 1.4 ounces, it's loaded with fiber from the nuts and chicory root fiber, with relatively little sugars.  I personally would seldom consider eating one of these as a meal, but would have it as a filling food when needed in times where a meal could not be obtained.  I would supplement this and would not rely on this alone for nutrition!  Without further information on what else is included in the diet, I don't understand how the \"Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center indicates that eating 2 KIND bars each day helps maintain your weight through low glycemic, deliciously satisfying, nutritionally rich ingredients that will keep you fuller longer.\"  I think that 400 calories of intake per day is too much for any snack item.  With that being said, I now carry one of these bars with me instead of another grain type bar for the times when I absolutely need something to eat or desire a chocolate fix.  When I have these, I no longer carry a little bag of nuts either.  Because I haven't yet purchased bars which haven't been heated, I can only say that those I've received are not visually appealing and require eating directly from the cellophane because the bits of chocolate fall away.  Despite that flaw, these are a great snack item that I will be purchasing and will try other varieties as well.  I would like to see these offered at a better value when purchased in a box rather than the current cost at about eighteen dollars for a pound box of twelve bars.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nVedica Organics - Organic Turmeric (Curcumin) Spice Powder (3 oz)\nReview:\nSeems like everyone is into turmeric these days.  You can buy it by the ounce, pound or capsule.  I like this particular organic turmeric powder but think it is currently overpriced.  It is securely packaged in a sealed plastic jar with a dispensing cap and screw top and since the powder is vibrant in color and I want it to stay that way, I have transferred mine into a glass jar and keep it in a cabinet.  The powder tastes very good and blends well with other spices for assorted curry blends.  There are currently a number of organic turmeric powders available and this one is fine.  Vedica Organics provided a sample for review at an extremely reduced cost.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Oz., All-Natural, Artisanal, Great for Salads, Grilled Fish and Meat, or Pasta\nReview:\nI have used this oil for salad dressings and to drizzle over veggies instead of butter. I can't say that is adds flavor, but it is definitely more healthy to use than other oils. This particular oil should not be used for frying as it does not have a high heat tolerance. I have used it in baked recipes and it does well. I have also bought the Special Edition Walnut oil directly from the company. It is a lot more expensive, but it does have a definite nutty flavor. I have also used the Special Edition on veggies, and it does add a good nutty flavor.\n\nI have used a number of the La Tourangelle oils and have not been disappointed with any of them. I have completely eliminated the use of non-nut oils to improve the quality of fats that we eat. When buying these nut oils, it is important to pay attention to which can be used with low heat or medium to high heat. It is also important to note which require refrigeration after opening - some do and some don't. To be on the safe side, I refrigerate all of them after opening. I think it helps to keep them fresher.\n\nAlthough some of the Amazon reviews dock stars for dented cans, this is not fair to the product, nor does it deteriorate or affect the quality of the product. This is a 5 star product and reviews should not reflect Amazon's shipping practices.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nChef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Seasoning Blends ~ Magic 7-Pack, Qty. 7 2-Ounce Bottles\nReview:\nI love these seasonings, and the variety is really convenient.

Oz, All-Natural, Artisanal, Great for Salads, Fruit, Fish, Marinades or Vegetables\nReview:\nThis one of the many La Tourangelle oils that I use. I particularly like this one because it can be used at higher temperatures. I haven't use vegetable or canola oils for a very long time, and prefer to use the healthier nuts oils for all of my cooking. This, and other, nut oils are used exclusively for all frying and baking. I substitute nut oils for oils used in all of my recipes, and the work wonderfully. In fact, my bread recipes seem to work better using these oils.\n\nAlthough nut oils still include fats, they are healthy fats, and do not have a negative effect on cholesterol or weight gain. Your body needs fats to function, but healthy fats are more beneficial.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Frontier Garlic Powder, 16 Ounce Bags (Pack of 2) \nReview:\nI use a lot of garlic powder, and I have found that the garlic powder purchased from the store is truly a powder. It is hard to mix with other ingredient, especially liquid, and tends to clump. I would describe this garlic powder as more of a fine granulated garlic. The smell is much more like fresh garlic. I can't say that I save money buying this garlic powder as 2 lbs. in the store actually costs a bit less in this area. The whole idea of using herbs and spices is to enhance flavor and aroma, and this garlic powder is the best for that. I would rather pay a little more to accomplish the desired results in dishes that I make. I like that Amazon is offering this garlic and saving me a trip to the store. I bought shaker bottles from Amazon, and filled one with this garlic powder. The rest of it went into the freezer to keep it fresher for longer.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRed Quinoa, 25 Lb Bag\nReview:\nFor the last couple of years, we have been using the pearl, or white, quinoa for its health value because reviews have described the flavor of red quinoa as being strong. I mistakenly assumed that strong would not be good. More recently, I tried a couple of small bags of the red quinoa to see if we liked it. All I can say is \"Wow\". The difference is like night and day. The white quinoa has little flavor and needs additives to have any at all. When eating it, it doesn't stay together at all. All of the little, teensy pieces can be difficult to keep together without some sort of sauce or a spoon. In contrast, the red quinoa, has a crunchy texture, and a nutty flavor. Granted, I still add garlic and onion powders in addition to other spices when I cook it, but we love the texture and the color. I did rinse this quinoa a couple of times before soaking just to make sure there weren't any hulls or dust in it. I think it's better to do this than take a chance it has been cleaned enough. I did find it to be clean, and little, if anything, rinsed out of it. I would highly recommend this quinoa to anyone that has not yet tried the red variety and to those that have. I still also use the pearl quinoa as an additive for pot roast, stews, and other things that I only want the nutritive value without the crunch, but the red variety is our alternative to rice or potatoes.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Bulk Whole Certified Organic Mustard Seed, Brown, 1 lb\nReview:\nI bought both this mustard seed and the yellow mustard seed. The brown mustard seed is much harder to find locally. I grind this seed with the yellow mustard seed to make homemade Dijon mustard. Making homemade mustard is so easy, and doesn't compare to anything you would buy in the store. My recipe for Dijon mustard is:\nIngredients:\n* 1/2 cup dry white wine\n* 1/2 cup white wine vinegar\n* 1/4 cup brown mustard seeds (about 1 1/2 oz.)\n* 1/4 cup yellow mustard seeds (about 1 1/2 oz.)\n* 3 garlic cloves, minced\n* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt\nDirections:\n1. Combine all ingredients in a small glass bowl, stir and cover tightly. Let sit at room temperature for 2 days.\n2. Transfer to a blender and blend until the desired consistency. Keep in mind that it's not possible for this mustard to reach a completely smooth consistency. Store tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.\n\nThis mustard seems to increase potency as it is stored. It tastes more like a horseradish mustard over time.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It has a nice, smooth texture, just like the regular peanut butter. But there is a distinct difference in taste. The truth is that the regular peanut butter has a richer taste, one in which the peanutty flavor comes through more distinctly. So, if you're on a diet or must watch your fat intake, you'll want to buy the reduced fat variety. But if you're sensitive to the taste, buy the regular.\n\nThe taste issue doesn't seem to be a problem of you're baking.

The peanut butter is smooth and creamy and has a really rich peanut butter taste. I've had some chocolate and peanut butter candies where you can hardly taste the peanut butter. Not so with Reese's. And the milk chocolate shell has a smooth texture and a pleasant taste that perfectly complements the peanut butter.

(There's a skillet recipe on the back of the package. We tried it and were well pleased.) They go well with a variety of Asian stir fry dishes. Also, each 14.2 oz. package contains two pouches, which is great if you just want to make a small quantity of noodles at one time. These noodles are fairly pricey compared to most noodles, but considering taste and convenience, they're worth it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Soy Flour, 16 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nOne thing I've come to expect from Bob's Red Mill products is excellence.

I have several bread recipes that call for soy flour, and I've been extremely pleased with the results I get from using Bob's Organic Soy Flour. I've also used it as one of the ingredients in my homemade granola, and I find that it adds a bit of extra body to the final product.

Good product. The taste is excellent, although a bit too salty for me. They were nice and fresh and tasty and didn't last nearly long enough. Next time it will be a bigger size package.\n\nHalves and pieces. Hmmmm. Where and how do they get all the broken cashews? I couldn't find a single non-broken one. Oh well, I guess that's truth in labeling. But, how do they all get broken? Is there someone in charge of breaking them as they come down the production line? If they're accidentally broken and won't sell for as much as the non-broken ones, why isn't the price cheaper? Oh well, does it really matter? Once they're in my mouth, all will get broken.\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHampton Farms Salted &amp; Roasted In-shell Peanuts * Large Bag * Net Wt. 80 Oz (5 Lbs.)\nReview:\nI enjoy late night snacking while reading or watching TV. I'm on a diet emphasizing cutting out as much sugar as possible and peanuts fit the bill with less than one gram per serving.. By the way, my bag is only 12 ounces and is branded with the \"San Diego Padres Baseball Club\" imprinted on the label. Probably a local variant. Same salted in the shell nuts. Different size bag. Same Hampton Farms logo. Maybe every city large enough to have a baseball club has it's own variant. Interesting way to sell more nuts, I suppose. In any case, they're quite good nuts. Mine seemed a little stale (not a problem) and I would have preferred them to be a little saltier. My last bag of peanuts was a five-pound bag of Hoodies that was stale to the point of inedible. These are good. I'll buy them again.\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCrunchmaster Artisan Four Cheese Rice Cracker, 3.5-Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI picked up these Crunchmaster Rice (Artisan Four Cheese) Crackers at a nearby Costco Store. They looked good, and a lady gave me one to taste. They were good. Into the cart went a six package box. They're the same as these, only packed together in a slightly different way.\n\nThe crackers are excellent. They're real crunchy, way moreso than most crackers and they have the faint taste and smell of cheese. They're lightly salted and have a very low fat content. I enjoy them by themselves as snacks, or I eat them with smoked oysters or sardines as a light lunch. Or, I have them with a variety of spreads. They're pretty versatile, and delicious I should add.\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNongShim Bowl Noodle Soup, Spicy Chicken, 3.03 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis afternoon I had a Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup of the Spicy Chicken variety. It's a quick lunch (four minutes) and quite tasty. My only gripes would be that it's too high in sodium, a complaint shared by almost all noodle bowls, and that it doesn't have enough protein for a good meal. I can easily add the latter. I also had a big Delicious Apple to supply something fresh and something with a lot of fiber. Altogether, the combination made a good lunch, and it was quick and easy.\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAmy's Organic Chili, Medium Black Bean, 14.7 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nSome time ago, I tried the Amy's Spicy Organic Chili and liked it very much. So, when I was back at the nearby Fresh and Easy store and looking over the chili, I spotted the Amy's Medium Organic Chili. Into the cart a can went. Well, I like this one too and it's actually a bit zesty. I thought I'd add some Frank's Hot Sauce if it wasn't tasty enough, but it turned out that there was no need. This is good stuff. It's meatless, but has beans, soybeans and tofu so the protein content is actually fairly high but the fat content is rather low. If I had any criticism, i night be that the sodium content is too high. But, all in all, it's a rather good chili. Given the choice, I think I'd slightly prefer the spicy variety.\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAmy's Organic Chili, Medium Black Bean, 14.7 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nMy nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market carries a lot of gourmet and health-related items and I like to try them. One I picked up recently was Amy's Organic Chili. I bought both the regular and the spicy varieties and I'm reviewing the spicy one here. It's quite good for a canned chili. I'd say it's at least as good as any other canned brand I've ever tried. Plus it's fairly low in fat and seems to lack that oily topping I associate with canned chili. I't's a little higher in sodium than I'd like, but not by much. The taste is quite good. It's somewhat zesty but I'd rate the spicyness as mild. The meat is ground and occurs as tittle interspersed grains rather than larger chunks. Of course, it's organic. I've always liked chili and this is a good one that I can keep stashed in my pantry. Amy's is a good brand and I'm very satisfied.\n\nGsry Peterson\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDavid Seeds Pumpkin Seeds, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nIf you're ever looking for a light snack to accompany watching television, a ball game or something like that, try David Pumpkin Seeds. They're lightly roasted, lightly salted and all natural. And they're delicious!\n\nSome people eat the entire seed, but I only eat the kernels. Thus, I have to crack each seed, extract the kernel and dispose of the hulls. This process can be somewhat time consuming, but like everything else, you get better and better with practice. Still, some people would regard this as a negative, but I would regard it as a positive. I can sometimes spend all evening consuming a delicious snack and watching TV and consume less than a single serving which amounts to 280 calories. Plus, seeds and nuts carry a heavy caloric load in general, to be sure, but they also carry a lot of vitamins, minerals, unsaturated vegetable fat and fiber. They may have calories, but they aren't empty calories! I worry a little about the salt content, but the David seeds are only lightly salted and I don't consume the entire seed.\n\nThese David Pumpkin Seeds are a fine light snack. Prepare to get addicted. I'll bet you can't eat just one, or one pack. They can be a little hard to find, but finding large quantities online is easy. Good snacking!\n\nGary Peterson\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I hated the vinegary bite, but kept drinking the beverage because of its health benefits.  Now, I have to ration the stuff to protect my wallet.  More recently, I fell into the same trap with this mayo.\n\nOn first try, I felt like the product simply tasted \"wrong.\"  I disliked it, but I'm thrifty; I didn't toss it in the trash.  By the 3rd or 4th try, my brain had accepted that this tasted different.  I began to appreciate the merits the flavor does have.  The texture is different, too.  Most mayonnaise seems more whipped (with air in it).  This is smoother and creamier.

This candy bar is one of my favorite coconut treats.  It is not disgustingly sweet, rather it has a delicate coconut flavor.  Normally, I dislike white chocolate but with the coconut, this candy bar is amazing.  The consistency and intensity of the bar is not like a mounds bar.  This is an actual candy bar with no filling.  The coconut flavor is melded with the chocolate.  The bar is fairly large.  I typically take three to four days to eat one bar - the restraint is hard, but at 240 calories a serving restraint is necessary.  Flecks of this bar are great on ice cream but also in thicker, warmer beverages.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNature's Path Organic Chewy Granola Bars, Sunny Hemp Plus, 7.4 Ounce Box (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI love this bar and that is probably because I love any treat that combines peanuts and chocolate.  I don't consider this a health bar.  This has a good amount of sugar and a good amount of fat.  I eat them because they are a great cheat treat.  When I eat well all day, I look forward to this soft but chewy bar that has real peanuts and what seems to be real chocolate (I detest bars that proclaim to have real chocolate but instead incorporate a fake chocolaty substance).\n\nWhat I like about this bar:\n1) The taste - Wow! For a granola bar the taste is phenomenal. The picture on the box does not lie.  You can see peanuts and oats and the chocolate topping tastes awesome.  The texture of the oats/nuts melds well with the oats and nuts.\n\n2) Portable and easy to pack - If you try to stay aware of your daily calorie intake, it is always great to have easy to carry snacks with their calories clearly labeled. Who has time to count out the exact number of pretzels that comprise 150 calories? That is part of the appeal of a granola bar. You've got a 150 calorie food item that can be placed in a purse or coat pocket and you are out the door.\n\n3) The company has made a conscious effort to reduce packaging in order to reduce impact on the environment.  The box is made of 100% recycled materials.\n\nWhat is questionable about this bar:\n1) This is a snack/treat bar and nothing else - This is not a healthful nutrition bar. The product packaging does not necessarily say this is healthful. It does use the words \"organic goodness\" and boasts \"9 grams of whole grains\". These notations may make some think this is a really healthy treat. But it's not. The bar has low fiber (2g) and pretty high sugar for a 150 calorie bar (11 grams).\n\n2)If you use snacks to hold you over, you probably should find a snack with at least 4 grams of fiber. The 2 gram bar is not going to tide you over very long.\n\nIf you feed these to your kids, there is a good likelihood they will like them. They are pretty sweet.  But again with the sugar, what else are you giving your kids during the day? Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 3/4 teaspoons in this bar. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this bar may not be worth it to you. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end.\n\nSummary:\nNature's Path has created a very tasty granola bar with quality ingredients. Props to the company for not saying this was a health or nutrition bar on the box. I am reviewing this as a treat bar and as a treat, it is a delicious option. If it were being reviewed for health, I would not be able to give it four stars as it has high sugar, high fat and low fiber.  Don't expect it to hold you over for hours but do expect it to satisfy your sweet tooth.\n\nThese granola bars are made in the United States.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBanana Nut Cheerios Cereal, 10.9 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI love plain cheerios but sometimes a little cheerio diversity is called for.  The banana nut flavor is not overly sweet and there is a distinctive banana taste, almost a slightly burnt banana taste.  I love pairing a bowl of these cheerios with so delicious coconut milk and sliced banana pieces.  The combination of the three easily keep me satiated from breakfast until lunch.  I occasionally mix this banana nut flavor with chocolate cheerios for an even sweeter, exceptional treat.\n\nWhile I do not find the banana nut flavor to be overly sweet, one should not overlook that sugar is the second ingredient for this food and, the sugar content is relatively high -- especially for frequent use by children.  Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 1/4 teaspoons in a single 3/4 cup serving of banana nut cheerios. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this cereal may be high for frequent consumption. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end. If you child is getting 2 and 1/4 teaspoons with this cereal, your child has consumed a fair amount of sugar for the morning.\n\nWhen paired with fresh bananas, this cereal can be filling but if limiting sugar for your kids (or your own meals), you might want to use sparingly.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWolfgang Puck Organic Signature Butternut Squash Soup, 14.5 oz. (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThis is a good soup -- there is no doubt.  The corn, carrots and potatoes are plentiful (no skimping on ingredients in the cans I've tried).  Together, the ingredients make a thick and hearty soup that is perfect for a cold winter day.  I did not feel the need to add salt -- the corn is not bland in flavor and the soup already has a lot of sodium. Moreover, I felt no need to add crackers.  The soup can hold its own.\n\nSome posters have noted that this soup has a high level of fat.  It does -- 13g per one cup serving.  Fat, of course, is not bad in moderation.  In my quest for the perfect corn soup, however, I have found an alternative option. It is worth noting here for those who may have particular dietary considerations.  Imagine foods makes an organic sweet corn soup that has 3g of fat per 1 cup serving. The soup comes in a boxed container and is just a corn base.  There are no special flavorings. As a base, it is a good corn soup but when you add several cups of frozen corn kernels (and cooked potatoes if you have the time and desire), you can have a soup just as hearty and delicious as Wolfgang Pucks but with less fat and calories.  This option does require about five minutes more of your time (if only adding frozen corn).  Wolfgang Puck's soup is quick -- in two minutes you have a steaming bowl of great corn soup and you don't have to wait for kernels to thaw.\n\nIf you are not looking closely at fat (or eat fat it in moderation) and want something quick, this soup is great.  If you are looking for a healthy alternative, I would take a little more time and build a hearty soup using the organic sweet corn soup from Imagine.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPacific Natural Foods All Natural Chipotle Sweet Potato Soup, 17 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nFirst, I typically love products produced by Pacific Natural Foods. This was not a winner in my book. The smell was the first thing that turned me off. I had to wait five minutes to even try the soup because it smelled so awful. When I tasted it, the spices used were overpowering and it was difficult to taste any sweet potato. What I could taste reminded me of curry and it seems like the soup could be married well with rice. Unfortunately as the soup is now, it would be too runny to pour over rice. I suppose a person could add some sweet potato and regular potatoes to make it thicker. I drowned the soup with saltines and it was edible but not enjoyable. I'm giving it two stars because I think with modifications it could be used for different non-soup purposes. Better luck next time Pacific.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nArtisana Macadamia/Cashew Butter (100% Organic), 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nAfter trying Artisana's Cacao Bliss, I wanted to sample some of the manufacturer's other products.  I really enjoy macademia nuts and thought the Macadamia with Cashews butter would be a good product to try.  This product is made with just two ingredients -- macadamias and cashews -- and I can say that this product demonstrates what a healthy, good for you food should taste like.\n\nUnlike Cacao Bliss, which is a solid product at room temperature, the macadamia cashew butter is easily retrieved from the container.  There was some oil separation but after a little stirring, one can take a butter knife and quickly spread the substance on a piece of toast or apple slices; the product is incredibly smooth out of the jar.  When looking at the butter, you will see little pieces of nuts which makes this product product have some texture.  This macadamia cashew butter is not as chunky as most chunky peanut butters; the chunks in this product are much finer.  I found the flavor to be very much influenced by the raw cashews and actually considered my jar to be more of a cashew butter than a macadamia butter.\n\nIt is recommended that this product be refrigerated for a longer life.\n\nWhile not noted explicitly on the product's label, I could see nothing that would contradict my belief that this is a vegan product.  There is no milk, honey, eggs or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product. According to the product packaging, this product is \"made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO's.\"\n\nThis is my second good experience with Artisana products.  For holiday gift giving, I'm definitely going to be packaging several of Artisana's products in gift baskets.  They are tasty, natural and unique.\n\nA note on another place to buy this product, iherb.com. I turn to iherb with frequency to purchase Artisana products.  The site has free shipping over a certain threshold and offers thousands upon thousands of natural and organic food products. If interested in trying iherb, you can use my code LEK375 for a five or ten dollar discount depending on order size.\n\nThis product is made in the United States\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCrystal Light Drink Mix - MARGARITA, 1.62 oz.

In terms of flavor, I find this acceptable.  It tastes like a very mild margarita (without alcohol).  It even smells like a margarita.  While I think Crystal Light has done a good job imitating a margarita, it is not my favorite Crystal Light product.\n\nIf you live near a Meijer, you can buy a five pack canister of the Margarita drink mix (as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Mocktails-Appletini-1-69-Ounce-Pack-of-4/dp/B005A1LGIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini, 1.69-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Moctails-Mojito-1-41-Ounce-Pack-of-4/dp/B005A1LINC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>) for about 2.79.\n\nIf you recycle your plastics, be aware that Crystal Light sells its product in a #5 container. Unless you live in a relatively progressive place, #5 plastics are typically very difficult to recycle. Whole Foods engages in a recycling initiative to collect #5 plastics but if you don't live near one and you care about recycling, these can be a challenging item to deal with.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a beverage that I would drink again but I don't know if I would purchase it if some of my other Crystal Light favorites were available like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Sunrise-Ruby-Red-Grapefruit-3-4-Ounce-Unit-Pack-of-6/dp/B001E53TMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Sunrise Ruby Red Grapefruit, 3.4-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Crystal-Light-Moctails-Mojito-1-41-Ounce-Pack-of-4/dp/B005A1LINC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Unfortunately, the flavor was extremely disappointing.  First of all, the cookie part didn't really taste like anything.  Red velvet, like Devil's food, is a type of CHOCOLATE, and there was very little chocolate flavor in these cookies.  Next, the filling was describe on the package as \"cream cheese flavored creme.\"  It tasted nothing at all like the unique flavor of sweetened cream cheese, which is tangy without being overly sweet; instead, this filling was just a super-sweet cream.  Honestly if I was going to splurge on something, I wish I had just purchased regular Oreos, because these were not worth it at all.  I hope my co-workers like them, because they will be getting the leftovers.  Although they are edible as a sweet, cream-filled store-bought cookie, I certainly don't recommend these as a red velvet treat.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S Nuggets Holiday Chocolate Candy, Milk Chocolate w/Toffee &amp; Almonds, 60 Ounce Bulk Bag\nReview:\nI am usually someone who prefers dark chocolate--I like the richness of the dark chocolate, and I find some milk chocolates too artificial tasting.  This Hershey variety is definitely an exception.  It is labelled \"Extra Creamy\" milk chocolate, and it's true--although sweeter than dark chocolate, these nuggets are definitely more creamy than the standard milk chocolate.  The little toffee bits--along with the crushed almonds--add a delicious bit of extra sweetness and crunch.\n\nFour of these little nuggets makes a single serving, which is a reasonable amount of calories at 200, but a bit high in fat, carbs, and sugar for me (13g, 21g, and 20g, respectively).  So, I just eat two nuggets at a time for a yummy little 100 calorie treat.  If you enjoy a toffee (or caramel, since I think it's quite similar) flavor, I would definitley recommend these nuggets and this generous 60-ounce bag.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nZonePerfect Nutrition Snack Bars, Chocolate Almond Raisin. 1.76 oz, (12 Count)\nReview:\nI am always looking for nutrition snack bars that will help me refuel after workouts, curb between meal hunger pangs, and hopefully, taste great, too!  I was encourged by the nutritional profile of the Zone Perfect bar, and I decided to give the Fudge Graham variety a try.  This bar comes in at 210 calories, with 7 grams of fat (4 saturated, 0 trans), 21 grams carbs, 1 gram fiber, and an excellent 16 grams protein.  The Fudge Gramam flavor has a nice texture--sort of like a Rice Crispie treat--and is covered in a fudge coating, but this had a bit of an artificial taste to me.  In addition, I didn't detect any graham flavor, which I found disappointing.  The bar did taste good, but I've also had better (the Pria Complete Peanut Butter Crunch are really delicious!), and I would've liked to see more fiber as well.  Overall, this is not a bad choice, but keep in mind that there may be better options available.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nPressed by KIND Fruit Bars, Mango Apple Chia, No Sugar Added, Gluten Free, 1.2oz, 12 Count\nReview:\nI thought these bars would be a good way to help me get in more fruit and vegetable servings--I like pineapple, bananas, kale, and spinach, so win-win, right?  Well, in reality, not so much.  The first thing that you notice upon opening these bars is that not only do they look like molded spinach, but also they SMELL very strongly of spinach, too.  Now, as I said, I LIKE spinach, and normally, I don't mind the scent of it at all.  However, it is much different in bar form!  The bar does taste significantly fruity, so if I can sort of hold my breath and get past the smell, I can manage to eat it, although obviously, this is not ideal.  The other issue I have with these bars is that the spinach/kale gets stuck between your teeth VERY easily, even worse than eating the fresh version of this items.  So in the end, these bars are really NOT worth it to me, which is too bad, as they could have been a nutritious, convenient snack.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nNature Valley Chewy Granola Bars, Vanilla Yogurt, 1.2 oz, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI wasn't sure if I would like these granola bars; although I like yogurt, I didn't really like the idea of a yogurt coating.  However, my niece's love of the bars encouraged me to try them for myself, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they are delicious!  The granola part is sweet and chewy, and the additional sweetness of the yogurt is a perfect compliment.  I've tried all the flavors but like the vanilla the best, as the others were a bit TOO sweet for my liking.  If you are a fan of granola bars and yogurt, you are likely to enjoy this winning combination.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar, Orange Cranberry, 1.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI was excited to try this product, as I usually have bars for breakfast, but it is getting harder to find ones that have good nutritional profiles in breakfast-appropriate (i.e., non-chocolate) flavors.  I love cranberry, so this bar seemed nearly perfect, especially given that I checked out the nutritional content prior to ordering.  At 4 grams, the amount of protein was a bit low for my liking, but the bar made up for this by being low in both sugar (12 grams) and saturated fat (1 gram) while being very high in fiber (7 grams).\n\nThe texture of this bar is the first thing that struck me as a bit odd.  Although it is moist (i.e., as opposed to hard and crunchy), it is not chewy; in fact, it breaks apart easily and is a bit on the crumbly side.  (I suppose it is somewhat similar to a a CLIF brand bar.)  The taste, however, was quite disappointing:  rather than the tart taste of cranberry or the sweetness of orange, I detected only a bitter flavor.  It tasted almost as if the bar had been flavored with the bitter rind of the orange.  There did seem to be little fruit pieces in the bar that may have been cranberry, but unfortunately, the unpleasant bitterness overpowered everything else.\n\nI thought the first bar that I tried was just okay, but the second one seemed worse, and now I'm afraid I might have to toss the whole box (which I HATE to do--I hate being wasteful, so I might try dipping them in yogurt or something just to get through them).  Perhaps another flavor by this brand would be better, but unfortunately, I can't recommend these.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Honey Roasted Peanuts, Golden Roast, 14 oz\nReview:\nI consider nuts one of the most healthy things you can eat--I keep them on hand for snacks, salads, meal throw-ins, whatever!

I'm new to gluten free, and have not tried many gluten free products. I don't know how these compare to other gluten free crackers.  But I do know that they are as good or better than any regular cracker I've tried.  Cracklebred crackers are light and airy, but very crispy.  They are a little delicate but still hold up under a gentle spread of hummus.  This variety is flavored with sun dried tomato and oregano, but I honestly did not pick up on those flavors.  I thought they tasted slightly savory, but I still enjoyed them with a spread of blueberry jam.  Each cracker contains just 17 calories so they are guilt free.

The walnuts, almonds, pistachios, and cranberries all taste very fresh. The package that I received in January expires in November of the same year. Each packet holds 1 ounce of snacks and it's just enough to hit the spot as a snack. Very lightly salted with sea salt, each packet contains just 15mg of sodium.\n\nI immediately noticed that the contents of each packet are not consistent with each other. Every package contains at least one piece of the variety. The amount of pistachios and almonds varies widely. In half of the 8 packets, there was only 1 pistachio. Most of the remaining packets had 2 pistachios, although one package had 5 of the little green nuts. Almonds also varied from 2 to 5 nuts. Some packages had a higher ratio of cranberries to nuts. I attached 2 images showing 2 different opened packages.\n\nThe cranberries are sweetened with sugar, not HFCS, and also contain a small amount of expeller pressed sunflower oil to keep them soft. There is additional oil added to the mixture, but I'm not sure why. Maybe to keep the nuts from drying out? Sunflower oil is not a good source of ALA, containing only 1% ALA. Regardless, there isn't enough to make my hands feel too oily.\n\nEach package contains about half of your daily recommended amount of alpha linolenic acid (ALA) not to be confused with the other ALA, alpha lipoic acid. This Omega 3 fatty acid is found in nuts and other plant foods.\n\nOverall, I really like this snack! It's satisfying and tastes great, and I know that I'm not eating something I shouldn't. I would easily add these to my shopping list.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Crunchy Coconut Granola, 18 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI bought this because I love coconut, and the ingredient label looked simple and healthy compared to most other brands of granola.

It does contain sugar, but the 4 grams of sugar per serving is low compared to other granola brands.  I also appreciate that this is not a hard granola, so it's easy to eat.  It's just crispy enough so that it holds up under milk.  I like it with Almond Breeze brand coconut milk.

These are very different in texture, but I really did enjoy them. This is the first time that I've tasted a flavored kale chip, and I love them. I brought the package to work and we shared it, and everyone that tried these kool ranch kale chips liked them, even Miss Picky. The bag didn't last long! They were crispy and tasty, and were not too salty. They only contain 220mg sodium per serving (half a bag) which surprised me since similar products usually contain more. The serving contains 140 calories and 6 grams of protein. Kale is loaded with vitamins, so it's a sneaky way to slip in some nutrients.  Although I loved the flavor, I was less than enthused about the clumps of kale chips that were stuck together due to the seasoning. They were tasty, but it was easy to get greedy with the clumps and leave the little bits and pieces for my coworkers to taste. The next time I get these kale chips, I'll try adding the leftover crumbs to a salad to add flavor to my lunch. And there will be a next time! I'll still make plain kale chips from scratch, but I can't make flavored chips to taste like this.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nColavita Instant Polenta Cornmeal, 16 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis polenta is delicious!

I can grill them or saute in a pan. They freeze well, so I can pull out just enough for dinner. This was my first experience with a quick cooking polenta. I have always taken the time to make old fashioned polenta, and it is worth the effort. But for an instant product, the Colavita polenta works out very well.\n\nSomeone else mentioned that this polenta is non-GMO, but the box didn't reflect that. I contacted the company and verified that it is indeed non-GMO, which makes it an even better choice for many people.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRishi Tea Organic Black Tea, Earl Grey Loose Tea, 3.3-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nEarl Grey Tea can be overwhelming. Generally, when an Earl Grey calls itself \"Bold\", they aren't joking. Personally, if there is too much bergamot oil in the tea, it is too overpowering for me to drink. I like to drink an aromatic tea, not a cup of perfume. The Rishi Earl Grey tea is described as \"bold and sweetly smooth with an enlivening aroma of bergamot citrus.\" I think that sums it up very well. I was a little concerned when I popped the lid on the tin, as the scent was very powerful.  However, it is a pleasant smelling tea that does not overwhelm me when the cup reaches the mouth. I can taste a high quality, rich black tea with sweet and lightly citrus tones.\n\nI also feel good about drinking this tea because it is a Fair Trade Certified tea that is shade grown from heirloom tea trees. It's organic as well as Kosher. Rishi also says this tea can be steeped multiple times, so this tea is also very economical. I'll definitely be trying more Rishi teas.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Organic Coconut Flour, 4 Pound\nReview:\nI really enjoy Nutiva coconut flour.

I like the new package since it blocks light and helps keep it fresh. The zipper was a little tricky to close, but it works.  I mainly use this coconut flour in morning smoothies to add texture and a big boost of fiber. I've used other brands that had a finer texture, but this one is fine for my purposes and it's often more affordable than others. It can be used in baking if you use it as a substitute for a small amount of the grain flour in your recipe, but it doesn't stand alone as a replacement.

It is much better than using water and it doesn't dilute the flavor of your meal.\n\nWe like this broth a lot and we recommend it to you as a 5 star product.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

He is also gluten and dairy sensitive, so the stuff he can eat is very limited.  He likes these candies because they are good (not good for sugar-free candy) and give him a fix for his chocolate cravings when he has them.  They are creamy and have good dark chocolate taste.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGG Bran Crispbread, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 30)\nReview:\nI first got these after reading about them in The Thin Commandments Diet.  They were recommended as a way of controlling appetite.  I have to say that they are an acquired taste.  My pet name for them is \"baked hay\".  But, I eat them because they help fill me up, give me fiber, and have only a few calories in each one.\n\nAs long as I don't eat them \"straight\", they are good.  Many mornings, I eat them with a little bit of spray butter, cinnamon and Splenda.  Other times, I dip them in the soup I'm eating.  Yet other times, I melt cheese on them. They help fill me up and satisfy my appetite.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGhirardelli Chocolate Intense Dark Squares, Sea Salt Soiree, 4.12 oz. ( Pack Of 4 )\nReview:\nThese squares are just so good.

Usually, if it's gluten free, it has waaaay too much sugar, for example.  I tried a box of these cookies for him.  He tried them and said that they are surprisingly good.\n\nThey are not mereingues, even though they are shaped like those types of cookies.  They are regular cookie consistency.  There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.

Not only can he eat them, but they taste good as well.

The first thing I noticed was the fact that it dissolved almost instantly  unlike a different rehydration drink I had tried in the past (NUUN). SOS Rehydrate had a refreshing flavor and tasted really good. It did not leave an after-taste in my mouth which is good.\n\nSOS Rehydrate should definitely be consumed with cold water in my opinion.

Was I going to turn into a modern day Euell Gibbons? Was my colon going to implode from all the fiber? After a playful smack on the head from the wife I decided to dive in.\n\nThe clusters have a pleasant, crumbly texture, while their taste is a lot like sweet popcorn. Even though popcorn wasn't invited to this pepita fiesta, thats still the dominant sensation. Fluffy, slightly buttery, and with a syrupy vanilla sugar glaze: this is what Id imagine vanilla cupcake popcorn is like.

I always keep some around. Now I normally prefer to brew my coffee in a French press or a single cone filter over the cup. I love freshly roasted coffee, so finding places that roast it daily is key. But many mornings or sometimes after dinner I will make Nescafe.\n\nTo me it's the best instant. The Starbuck's instant is too strong (although good for Mochas with milk), and many other brands just taste bitter and cheap.\n\nNot sure about now, but Nescafe was the ONLY instant that many restaurants kept around. It was better than keeping coffee on a hot plate for too long, and it was quick to make.\n\nEach of these little packs makes one cup of coffee...just add hot water and you're ready to go.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAquafusion Low Calorie Drink Mix, Blackberry Plum, 7 count (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nMy family loves powdered drink pouches. As long as they contain healthy ingredients I'm okay with that as it gets them to drink more water.\n\nThe AquaFusion mixes are real sugar and stevia. Not the best ingredients, but not the worst either. But, holy cow batman, are they sweet. Each pouch is supposed to be 2 servings, but that's too much. We cut it pouch down to 4 servings and it's just right.\n\nThe flavor is good. The blackberry is more pronounced than the plum, but it's good overall.\n\nThe only odd thing is the color. We've never used clear mixes before. Generally something berry flavored is blue or purple. Don't forget that you've added the AquaFusion already as you can't see it unless you try it.\n\nAll in all, not bad. But way too sweet in it's original serving suggestion.

I like the packaging, portability, lack of need for refridgeration, and concentrated aspect. Coffee-mate claims this is a triple strenght formula, but I think results will vary from person to person. I would put it at more of a double strength level. But it tastes pretty much the same as their little cup packages or the big container you need to refridgerate, so all is good. The fact that it is so portable and doesn't need refrideration is a definite plus. It may take you a few tried to figure out how much you need in your mug or travel container though. You do pay extra for this convenience though.\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTwo Rivers Light Roast Coffee Pods Variety Pack for Keurig K-Cup Makers, 40 Count\nReview:\nI have a Keurig K-Cup machine but I admit that it is not my favorite coffee. I usually make a pot of regular drip coffee in the morning it gets used throughout the day. I also have a Nespresso machine which I love, but that is in another class. K-cups are not for you if you want a big, rich steaming mug of coffee. Most cups I've tried lack flavor and punch unless made at the absolute smallest size. Even then, they might not be the greatest coffee. For me, I usually need to brew two for a satisfying cuppa.\n\nWhat I find K-cups great for are an office environment, or if you want a quick cup of coffee that is freshly brewed. While not normally a flavored coffee person, this format lets me try different things. That is where the Two Rivers 40-count Mega Coffee selection shines. You get a wide variety of coffees (no decaf in mine) at a fair price. I would say that about half of them are flavored. They come loose in a box so half the fun is picking through them to find what you want to drink. I've only had a few of them (Workaholics Strait Grizzly, Hamilton Mocha Swirl, and Brooklyn Red Velvet), but brewed at the smallest size, I found them each to be distinctive and flavorful. This 40-pack *IS* for someone who wants to try different coffees and doesn't mind a small cup and would make a nice gift for someone in your life who owns a Kuerig and is adventurous when it comes to coffee. It is also good for helping you track down what K-Cups are good and which aren't so hot. I'm looking forward to seeing what my \"mystery\" cup is, but am saving it for last.\n\nI received a sample pack for objective review purposes.\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCommunity Coffee 100% Pure Chicory Medium Roast Premium Ground 12 Oz Bag (6 Pack), Rich Flavorful Taste Naturally Decaf\nReview:\nI've purchased this chicory directly from Community Coffee in the past and thought I'd share my experience here. I rarely see any chicory in my local supermarket and then usually only the pre-blended&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/French-Market-City-Roast/dp/B002ZOPRT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">French Market City Roast</a>, which I think is good, but not great. I prefer to have total control over how much chicory I add to my coffee, and blend in a bit less than the manufacturer recommends dependent on the strength of the coffee. Chicory seems to work best with a heartier roast, mellowing it out and making it less acidic. My recommendation would be to try adding one scoop to every 3 scoops of coffee and then adjusting it to taste. Also be sure to use a bit less overall when adding chicory. I find a little goes a long way. I DO NOT recommend drinking it in place of coffee, though I've read that they used to do that when beans were scarce. It's okay (when drunk hot), but it works much better as a coffee enhancer. Chicory is not for everyone however, so if possible, try before you buy. Six bags will last you quite a while!\n\nI've had nothing but good experience with Community Coffee products and their Pure Chicory is no exception. I've yet to find a better economical 100% chicory.

My daily cuppa wouldn't be the same without it. I know it isn't the healthiest product on Earth with numerous artificial ingredients, but is are low cal and adds to the flavor of my coffee. I usually have vanilla or hazelnut, but thought I would give Pumpkin Spice a go. There is a tea by that name which I like to drink during the cooler months. These special edition flavors can be fun to try and have on occasion.\n\nI'm impressed with Pumpkin Spice. It is actually a flavor I'd have on a regular basis. Cinnamon and sweetness pervade with pleasant pumpkin undertone. This is thick like the more concentrated Coffee-mate creamer that Nestle just started offering in squeeze bottles. One squirt is good for a regular cup for me, and three is great for my large travel mug. It is sweet enough that I don't have to add any additional sweetener. The pump is handy as well. It was easy to assemble and once I figured out how to twist the top just right to release the pump I was in business. It has a solid feel when pressing it down and it doesn't drip. This size and format would work well in an office environment, but knowing how much coffee I drink, it is good for home use as well.\n\nI hope they release a \"Natural Bliss\" version, but I'm content to enjoy Pumpkin Spice, artificial ingredients and all.\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nJava Factory Single Cup Coffee for Keurig K Cup Brewers, Dark and Handsome Dark Roast, 24 Count\nReview:\nJava Factory's offering has above average variety for a multi-pack. Translation -- I like most of them.  Smooth Caffeinator and Wakey Wakey are not ones I would choose to drink, but they were not undrinkable. They just weren't to my tastes, a bit on the light side. The other Cup varieties are darn good, even the flavored ones which are normally not my favorites. Dark & Handsome makes a great morning cup, and Da Bomb is a rich tasting caffeine explosion. The two flavored varieties make good dessert coffees, or regular cups for those who are into that. Actually, Vanilla Dream might just be the best tasting out of the bunch.\n\nAll cups worked flawlessly with my Keurig. If getting another mixed pack, this would be on my shortlist. I received a sample of this product for objective review purposes.\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLavazza Gran Selezione Ground Coffee Blend, Dark Roast, 12-Ounce Bag\nReview:\nI'm a coffee maven and take great pride in making that perfect cup of joe. I've tried all kinds of coffee, and as my wife has observed, have my coffee-making technique down to a science. I'm always on the lookout for a coffee with good flavor. For maximum freshness I prefer to grind my own beans, preferably freshly roasted. The LavAzza Gran Selezione Ground Coffee Blend comes finely ground (ideal for espressos and drip makers). Given it's already ground and roasted in Italy, I was impressed with how fresh tasting it is. It made a rich, smooth pot of coffee. Gran Selezione is labeled \"intense and chocolaty\" and though I detect it, my wife didn't really notice. She complimented me on how delicious the coffee I had made for her was (I did not tell her it was LavAzza until afterwards). It passed the wife test and she wanted me to brew it again the next day.\n\nI like that LavAzza is a family owned business that is responsible with their sourcing. This coffee tastes like it was roasted with care and is something I would have no hesitation getting again. On a scale of 1-10, it is an intensity level of 7 -- a moderate dark roast.  For a coffee of this price range, it's an exceptional value. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a quality cup of coffee and prefers the convenience of pre-ground beans.\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKauai Coffee Single-serve Pods, Island Sunrise Mild Roast &ndash; 100% Premium Arabica Coffee from Hawaii&rsquo;s Largest Coffee Grower, Keurig-Compatible Cups - 12 Count\nReview:\nI love Kona coffee. That and Blue Mountain are my favorites. A couple of months ago, I found Kauai ground coffee on sale at my local grocer and gave it a shot. Both myself and my wife were impressed. It has most of the characteristics of a rich and mellow Kona coffee without the huge price tag. Even in pre-ground form it was good.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and I get these K-cup single-serve compatibles from Amazon. I've found many K-cups to be a bit weak and unimpressive, but was pleased to find that these compatibles live up to the Kauai standard.  While perhaps oh-so-slightly weaker than what I would brew in the regular coffee maker, they still retain their flavor as single-serve options. The format is not quite K-cup, but worked well in my unit and looks like it is more environmentally friendly.\n\nI only use my Keurig occasionally, but I've found a K-cup that I am happy to stock for those occasions!\n\n~ Kort\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

DARK CHOCOLATE\nReview:\nPurchased this because I love English butter toffee with Almonds and I have purchased just about all from Amazon. First of all this is a little bit on the well done side. I can see how one reviewer said that it was burnt. I am not sure about their method or any method of making this. I can only say that the flavor is mild. Tastes like the sugar content is half of what it usually taste like. Basically it is not really sweet, some people may like that I kind of don't like it this way. This Toffee also contains Almonds inside not just sprinkled on top of the dark chocolate. That in itself may make taste less sweet.\n  The appearance looks very good like homemade. It appears that much care was put into making this toffee so I do not believe it is darker in appearance by accident. This Toffee is very well made and its presentation is great. Now I am making my critique based on my favorite English Butter Toffee with Almonds and that is Aunt Mae's Sweet Tooth. Aunt Mae's is made with milk chocolate sprinkled with Almonds. It is the kind of Toffee I was brought up eating. The taste is twice as sweet as this and has no almonds mixed in the Toffee itself.\n  Both of these brands are made in big sheets and broken to fit inside the box. Depending on what you are used to or you like Toffee that is not too sweet ? If you want Toffee on the mild side then this is great and deserves five stars. For my personal taste and probably most people that like English Butter Toffee are going to like Aunt Mae's because it is more traditional and very thick. I'm only giving this four stars because it is not my favorite because it is not sweet enough and may have a well done taste to it?\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTonnino Ventresca Tuna in Olive Oil 6.7 oz.

And the instructions directed me to add 1/2 cup of water to that small portion.  My first try resulted in too-thin oatmeal, so the next time I used 1/3 cup (and 1 minute in the microwave).  That ended up with a thicker hot cereal more to my tastes, but I had to let it sit more afterward to better \"cook\" the oatmeal.\n\nThe taste is pretty good for an instant hot cereal, but there's a weird, powdery, tongue-coating sensation that comes with it even though the oatmeal is moist.  It's not a taste, per se, or even a true chalkiness.  It's just . . . strange.  Once I got used to it, however, it didn't bother me.  I do like that the berries -- the blueberries, in particular -- aren't chewy after preparation like so many other dehydrated fruit products.  Because there are no artificial flavors, you don't get that cloying artificial \"berry\" taste that some products have.  Yeah, it doesn't taste like fresh berries, but it's much better than most.

I'm more of a dark chocolate woman, so the extra creamy milk didn't appeal to me, although my mother-in-law loved hers.  These are solid bars -- that is, they don't have creamy fillings.

It is packed with nuts and raisins -- they stick up through the top of the segments.  If you are a lover of milk chocolate, nuts, and fruit, then you've probably found your bar.\n\nEach bar is a hefty 6.87 ounces.  To give you a comparison, Ghirardelli and Lindt large bars run about 3.5 ounces.  Although Cailler is manufactured by Swiss Nestl&eacute;, the high milk content is more reminscent of Cadbury than the Nestl&eacute; bars Americans are used to.  The milk tends to give the chocolate a creamier texture, though less intense flavor.\n\nThis chocolate bar satisfies my sweet tooth and cravings for nuts more than it does when my craving for chocolate, probably because I usually reach for dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate.  If you like milk chocolate more than dark, you will likely love these bars.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSkippy Natural Creamy Peanut Butter Spread with Honey, 15 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis Skippy peanut butter tastes like those honey-roasted peanuts you sometimes get in a bar -- and it's just as addictive.

This peanut butter contains more sugar per serving than than regular Jif -- 5 versus 3 grams -- so don't buy this thinking it's more healthy.  It contains no mono- or diglycerides, however.\n\nI grew up on Skippy peanut butter, but when I tasted Jif as an adult, I was hooked on the sweeter taste and switched brands.  Of course, I've also eaten natural peanut butters over the years, and they usually contained no sugar.  I was surprised that this \"natural\" brand had so much sugar added.  Kids and those of us with a sweet tooth will love the taste of this Skippy; I'm not sure health-conscious parents will.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFood Should Taste Good, Tortilla Chips, Multigrain Bean Chips, Pinto Bean, 5.5 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese sturdy chips taste great, with the nutty flavor of beans and seeds.  Although they are salted, the salt is not overbearing, and the grain flavor comes through as the strongest flavor.\n\nDespite the ingredients of pinto beans, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, sesame seeds, and quinoa, these are still chips, and therefore are not as healthy as eating these ingredients separately.  They also contain stone ground corn (second ingredient, after pinto beans), brown rice flour, and cane sugar.  The serving size of 10 chips/1 oz. contains 3 g of fiber, 3 g of protein, and 2 g of sugar.  To compare, the Snyders pretzels I have in my pantry have, in 1 ounce, the same amount of fiber but only 1 gram of protei and no sugar in a single serving.  One ounce of these chips has 140 calories; one ounce of the pretzel have only 100 calories.\n\nAs a side to a sandwich or as a snack, these multigrain bean chips are great, as long as you accept that they are still extra calories without much nutritional content.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHershey's Caramels, Dark Chocolate Caramels, 7.2 Ounce (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nThese individually wrapped caramels have the perfect dark chocolate to caramel ratio.  The caramels are soft and buttery tasting, and the chocolate is, well, Hershey's.  I love that I can put out a bowl of these, and they don't get stale or mushed together because of the wrapping.  They are perfect for Christmas stockings, sitting on a desk, or just snacking.\n\n-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I was astonished by the sweetness, though I rarely have sweet foods so may have found this sweeter than others would, but did a web search to make sure there was no sweetener. It maybe the combination of flavors that gives it such a sweet impact on the palate. This is now my favorite herb tea, and I enjoy several cups a day, or if a craving hits I drink this tea instead. I find the cinnamon taste  to be just right, since I didn't like strong cinnamon teas before. The cost through Amazon is a bit less than in my local market unless they have a sale.

This soup is outstanding on its own, and for low carbers/diabetics, it is a special treat. I use this mostly as a sauce for chicken, pork chops, veggies. I treat it like mushroom soup for a sauce, thinning with cream or broth if needed, which normally I don't.  It has just a bit of spiciness to it, and for me it makes a big difference in ease of prep and added variety to what are sometimes bland dishes. There are few canned soups I like, but Progresso makes the ones I find palatable.

I just peeled myself off the ceiling after drinking a cup of this. This might be better named \"Double Sugar\" Flavor Hot Chocolate mix.\n\nFirst, the good stuff. There is no doubt in my mind that Ghirardelli continues to make a distinctive, excellent quality chocolate. The cocoa used in this mix is smooth, dark, fruity and aromatic. Nothing else like it that I've ever tasted.\n\nNow, the criticism. There is just too much sugar in the mix. The recommended proportion of mix to 8 oz milk is four tablespoons. (By the by, there is no powdered milk in here. You must add your own milk--or soymilk or rice milk--great option for lactose-intolerant types.)\n\nPeople, you are using a quarter cup of mix at 4 Tbs and most of the mix seems to be granulated sugar, which you can taste and crunch in your mouth if you sample the dry mix. Cutting down fifty percent on the mix gave me an acceptable cup of cocoa but...it was no longer double chocolate and it had naturally a poorer mouth feel and aroma.\n\nDouble Chocolate Mix is some of the best cocoa I WOULD have had, if Ghirardelli could see their way to making a lower sugar version, and please, no sugar substitute, which I don't like to use.\n\nSummary; great chocolate flavor, unsurpassed. But overly sweet. If you don't like supersweet cocoa, pass this up. If you do love extremely sweet hot drinks, you will absolutely adore this mix.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBarista Prima Italian Roast Coffee Keurig Vue Portion Pack, 24 count\nReview:\nIf you like strong, dark coffee, the Barista Italian roast for the Vue cup is excellent. I make it on the STRONG setting for 8oz and it's perfect. In fact, it's better than what I make in my regular pot unless I have very fresh coffee just ground from beans. The color is a rich, blackish brown, the roast is dark but not burnt-tasting and of all the coffees for the Vue I've tried, this one wins hands-down. I have the same blend in K-cups (for the office, where the K version sits) and they are not as good, for some reason. The Vue is not the most economical way to make coffee (that would probably be a plastic Melitta filter with a paper cone and a mug or a French Press) but the Keurig is fast and convenient. And I get the coffee the strength and temperature just the way I like it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBarista Prima House Blend Keurig K-Cups,18 Count\nReview:\nI had a sampler and tried Italian Roast, Columbian, House Blend and a few other Barista blends. By far, the House Blend is my favorite. It's dark but not burnt, not overly strong and it has character. It stands up to milk and sugar but is pleasant when drunk black. Of all the coffees I've tried in the Keurig, this one is by far the best. It's balanced and hearty.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKrusteaz Belgian Supreme Waffle Mix, 28-Ounce Box (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is an excellent mix for waffles. You can make them with or without the egg and oil, but they are better with those ingredients added. Waffles are not diet food.\n\nThere is a trick to make really crisp light waffles, however. Make up the mix according to directions but do it this way:\n\n1. Substitute melted butter for some or all of the oil.\n2. Separate the egg. Add the yolk as you mix the rest of the ingredients, then beat the egg white until stiff and fold it in as the last step (put the whipped egg white on top of the batter, turn it in with a spatula, cutting it in gently until it is just mixed and the egg white is not showing lumps of white.)\n\nThis trick will also work with any gluten free mix you may use (and those flours tend to be heavier than this mix.) I also add a pinch of ground cloves or cinnamon to add some flavor. Naturally, using a very good waffle maker, such as this one, will insure you get the lightest, fluffiest waffles you can make.

My dad's favorite was cream cheese and apple butter. I had them with strawberries and huge mounds of whipped cream in Luxembourg, and the best way I ever had them was with cherries (rather like pie filling) and whipped cream in a little mountain village in Germany. Those were awesome. As I said, not diet food, though you can simply dust them with powdered sugar and they still are pretty darn tasty.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa Keurig Vue Portion Pack, 32 Count\nReview:\nThis hot chocolate is nice and convenient and you can brew it strong or less strong because the VUE lets you customize temperature and volume. But sad to say, I found it too sweet. The reason for it's being sweet is that in addition to sugar, it is sweetened with sucralose (aka Splenda.) This is a new trend in foods-- a mix of natural and artificial sweeteners. (Have you seen chewing gum? Even the non-sugar-free varieties have aspartame?) The reason for using a mix of natural and artificial is interesting but I believe in this case, using sucralose lowers the calorie count of the cocoa and it also allows more sweetener in a smaller cup size, as sucralose takes up less space than granulated sugar. I had to tease out the ingredient info by carefully reading the box, as it doesn't say so on the cup.\n\nHere's the good news, if you don't want sucralose, or even if you don't want sugar AND sucralose, you can buy packet cocoas and make a cup of hot water with the VUE, any volume and temp you choose. Just mix it up yourself. The only powdered mix I ever liked was Caotina (from Switzerland) which was not so sweet as American varieties but I can't find it in the US. However, I have guests who adore hot chocolate when they visit my office or home, so I keep Swiss Miss on hand.\n\nIn any case, for the Cafe Escapes, blech!\nRating:\n1.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

As I brew 4 gallons at a time, not having to rip open, tap empty and dispose of 64 packets was nice, but that still does not make up for this liquid's triple net sweetening cost.  Should I find it again under $5/ounce I would get more, barring that - I'll probably go back to using cheaper packets.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDilmah Tea, 100% Pure Ceylon Tea, Loose Leaf, 4.41-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI used to buy Ceylon labeled tea exported from middle eastern countries&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ahmad-500g-Loose-Ceylon-Tea-1-23-Ounce-Packet-Pack-of-4/dp/B001EO5ZMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ahmad 500g Loose Ceylon Tea, 1.23-Ounce Packet (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;for around $12 per kilo, only to later learn about high mountain genuine (lion&sword seal) Ceylon from Sri Lanka.  Being able to buy the real thing on Amazon for $20 per kilo was an amazing find for me, as I brew a Gallon per day using a drip style coffee maker.  Only 1g per cup is needed here, not the typical 2g per cup you may need with cheaper loosely packed leafy Ceylons, so each box can yeild over a hundred 8oz cups of tea - as no leaf rinsing is needed.\nThis is NOT some low quality crushed leaf dust, just a fine packed leaf that requires a paper filter to brew to yield a crystal clear amber tea - don't use a hole steeper - only a fine screen will do.  This is an affordable leaf type especially for ice tea lovers.

So for every gallon (16 cups) I brew, I use just 8g of this tea leaf, with 16x yellow 1g Splenda packets, and get perfect lightly sweet sugar free tea every time!  That gets my cost per large 8oz cup of fresh brewed no preservative iced tea down under 10.  Flavor with a tablespoon of cranberry or grapefruit juice for an extra kick.  This tea the best balance of quality and afford ability.

A tea at this price point should not be using \"flavoring\" but the real essence, oil or dehydrated Bergamot citrus fruit.  The leaves are cut up into 2mm bits, so you must use a paper filter when seeping this loose tea.  The double capped tin does a fine job of air sealing the tea, so there is no need for an inner foil wrapper as others have contested.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nGolden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky, Teriyaki,  3.25 Ounce Pouches (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nI have tried every GoldenValleyNatural.com Jerky product.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because some of the beans are not completely peeled and I have to laboriously clean them off.

I've been buying nuts online for years and have had some successes and some failures; these are a 100% success.  They are huge (some competitors' are a bit smaller), whole (not that I really mind fragments but there are none to be found here) and they taste like Brazil Nuts (I've had some that must have been sharing the production line with peanuts - I love peanuts but I don't want to taste them when I'm eating Brazil Nuts).

It's hard to find good quality nuts of any kind that are unsalted.  These are first quality AND unsalted.  I eat them out of the can when I can't resist, but I mostly use them in stir-fry concoctions (the bottled sauces I use generally have way too much sodium all by themselves).  They are excellent with shrimp or with scallops.

I allow myself this occasionally and it is a reasonably acceptable alternative to pasta.  I've always thought of pasta as a blank slate - it tastes like whatever you put on it - but this is a little different.  It doesn't taste like anything, no matter what you put on it, but it's *there* and provides some pasta-like texture and pasta-like interest in the dish.  I do enjoy it and will continue to buy it.  If you're avoiding carbs and think you have to swear off pasta completely, this really is worth a shot.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBibigo Korean Gochujang Sauce, 11.46 Ounce, 2 Count\nReview:\nI'm all about the sauces - I claim to be able to cook but mostly I experiment with Indo-Asian condiments and noodles or vegetables and such.  If my guests like what I came up with I take the credit, otherwise I blame the sauce I snuck in on them.\n\nOther reviewers have already pointed out that this is pretty thick - it's not a paste but it's definitely not watery thin, and it's not oily thin either (think of sesame oil or chili oil - it's not like that).  To my taste, both the sweet and spicy elements are right there prominently in your face without a lot of subtlety which suits me just fine.  There is a slight smokiness to the flavor and it has a pretty spicy kick for a finish so there's more to it than just fire and sugar.\n\nI love hot stuff and can deal with quite a bit of heat, but I must say this would be a little over the top as the only sauce in, say, a stir fry.  The heat builds as you keep eating and it will get your attention.  (Lest you assume I'm a wimp, I'm the guy who brings his own chili oil/chili paste to the Asian buffet when a group of coworkers go out for lunch.)\n\nI marinated some raw shrimp in it before steaming with veggies and sticky rice and that was a perfect use for it.  It's also great as a flavor variation if you like doctoring up ramen noodles as I do sometime.  But my favorite use so far is to add it to pizza - it enhances pretty much any variation.  I was an early adopter of Sriracha sauce for this purpose, 20+ years ago, and I completely burned out on that stuff a long time back.  This has about the same punch but a completely different taste that works with old-school pepperoni and red sauce, chicken and white sauce, olive oil based pizza, veggie, you name it.  Just a bit here and there as an enhancement and you can transform what was an excellent pizza pie into a completely different, but still excellent pizza pie.  A two-fer!\n\nOne caveat: Gochujang is a Korean staple, not an exotic rarity.  You can buy it in paste form for a lot less and mix up your own version of this sauce with, e.g., sesame oil and soy sauce and a few other odds and ends.  It's a convenience item and if you buy this product you are paying a premium for the convenience.\n\nI racked my brain to justify fewer than 5 stars because this is a Vine review of a free product, the presence of which appears to cause some folks all kinds of heartburn.

Made with wholesome ingredients, I don't have to feel bad about eating these as a snack. There aren't any ingredients you can't pronounce, and I feel good that they're high quality ingredients-- certified gluten-free and non-GMO verified.\n\nOne serving is 140 calories, with 45 of them being fat.

It's very sweet and tasty, but there's little or no nutritional value in here, despite being made from oats. The product is heavily processed and definitely what anyone would call healthy. Made with natural and artificial flavors, the ingredients list is very long (see bottom of review). It's loaded with sugar and not something you want to give yourself or your kids on a regular basis. Note how many times sugar or its variants appear in the list (glucose, fructose).\n\nEach bar is 1.23 oz. Daily value: Fiber 1g (5%), Vitamin A (0%), Vitamin C (0%), Calcium (10%), Iron (2%). 150 calories per bar (40 from fat), 11g of sugar. I'm giving the product 4 stars based on taste and texture. It's chewy, but not hard like Nature Valley granola bars.\n\nIngredients: granola (whole grain rolled oats, whole grain rolled wheat, brown sugar, sunflower oil, high fructose corn syrup, dried coconut, honey, sodium bicarbonate, natural flavor, whey and whey protein concentrate), yogurt flavored coating (sugar, palm kernel and palm oil, whey protein concentrate, yogurt flavored powder, soy lecithin, natural flavor, artificial color, citric acid, salt), corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, brown rice crisp (whole grain brown rice, sugar, malted barley flour, salt), brown sugar, glycerin, vegetable shortening (canola oil, palm and palm kernel oils), corn flakes (milled corn, sugar, salt, malted barley extract), whey mineral concentrate, oat flour, rice flour, sweetened dried strawberries (glucose syrup, strawberries, high fructose corn syrup, modified potato starch, sodium alginate), corn syrup solids, sorbitol, salt, sugar, modified food starch, soy lecithin, natural flavor, malted barley flour, sodium bicarbonate, BHT (a preservative), citric acid, water.\n\nMade in Canada.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nThai Kitchen Gluten Free Green Curry Paste, 4 oz\nReview:\nI used to buy this Thai Kitchen red curry paste when I was in college. Sadly, the recipe seems to have changed. It lacks flavor and intensity.

(Several varieties are co-mingled on this page.) *\n\nWe didn't like this pancake mix. In terms of ease, the instructions say to just add water, but the resulting taste is not very good if you do just that. My wife and I made them several times over the last week and were not satisfied with the flavor and texture. She said they were \"mushy\". I didn't like that they weren't fluffy. They are dense and too elastic, but not in a good way. This is owing to the potato starch and cassava starch in the recipe. When I made them, one side looked wrinkly when I flipped them prematurely, due to how potato starch cooks.\n\nTo me, pancakes should be airy and spongey. Good pancakes sop up the syrup poured on top of them. These don't do that. Making them with eggs greatly improves the appearance and taste, but they're still not as good as all flour pancakes.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Almonds, Bold Habanero BBQ, 16 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThe heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.\n\nSatisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.\n\nBlue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHEALTH WARRIOR Chia Bars, Acai Berry, Gluten Free, Vegan, 25g bars, 15 Count\nReview:\n<div id=\"video-block-RZQLT3NBPIU1U\" class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\"></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1a0o5EDn2S.mp4\" class=\"video-url\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"\" value=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81gG8Aia54S.png\" class=\"video-slate-img-url\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not a huge fan of snack bars like Clif Bars, but I love these. Chia seeds may seem like the latest health food craze, but they've actually been eaten for thousands of years by peoples in Meso-America. Valued for their dense nutritional content, they were an important food crop for the Mayans, not just the stuff covering tacky terracotta heads. I've been eating them for a number of years for their high protein content, fiber, and high levels of plant-based Omega-3 fatty acids. Acai berry is another health food supplement additive. It's been around for longer (mostly for use in juices and shakes) and many people have heard of it, even if just by name. They are native to South America and grow on palm trees like a huge cluster of grapes. It's much better tasting than the coffee one, in my opinion. The coffee one doesn't taste much like coffee (or a really weak coffee).\n\nI love the way these bars are moist, with a satisfyingly dense and chewy mouth-feel. Chia seeds themselves don't have much of a taste, but they provide a lot of crunchy texture like poppy seeds or sesame seeds. The taste of the bar is tart and sweet, and all in balance.\n\nI don't think they're ideal for intense sports activity unless you have water readily available, however, due to the nature of how chia seeds interact with liquid (e.g. saliva) in your mouth. After finishing the bar, you may feel some loose residual seeds just kind of hanging out in your mouth. They will require sloshing out with water to clean up. For me, they don't get stuck in my teeth, but feeling around with my tongue, there are loose seed particles around the inside the mouth like the cheek pockets. That's a natural property of chia seeds themselves and not a fault of this product since chia seeds swells in water and form a sticky, gelatinous outer coating.\n\nMy only problem with this product is how expensive it is for how small it is. That's partly a result of high demand for chia seeds, which has sent prices quadrupling or more since I started eating them 4 years ago.\n\nI do love these bars and don't feel guilty eating them because they are so packed with nutrients.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Honey Roasted Peanuts, Golden Roast, 14 oz\nReview:\nI'm not sure you need to read a review on peanuts. But here goes.\n\nWhat you see is what you get, folks. This is a jar of peanuts. Jar is plastic and recyclable, with a freshness seal under the lid to peel away. Or keep it partially attached like I do.\n\nThe nuts are in mostly halves (with a scattering of wholes), and pretty much like you see in the photo, though the image has been touched up to remove the dust that settled at the bottom of the can. The peanuts in the picture look too clean compared to the real thing. A fair percentage of the peanuts still have some of their outer skin on them. I'd say about 10% or less do. This is bonus to me, since some fiber is retained. Peanuts are high in fiber and protein.\n\nTaste is about as expected, with a good crunchiness. If you are watching your sodium intake like I am, go for the unsalted variety. The peanuts can also be ground up for things like Thai dishes or ice cream topping.\n\nLabel says \"Packed in USA\".

My first impression was that this acai berry smells very similar and almost identical to blueberry.  Acai powder is packed with goodies for your body such as antioxidant, fiber, vitamin A and C. It is a great vegan, gluten free treat and very healthy.\n\nThe powder is very dark in color. I tasted the powder raw and it's actually pretty good. Leaves a slight sweet aftertaste.\nI don't have a blender which I hope to get one soon to experiment more with this acai powder. I will mix it with yogurt next time I purchase some too.\nWhat I did here was taking:\n- 2 teaspoons of acai\n- 1 teaspoon of matcha (green tea powder)\nwith a bit of hot water. I whisk them together with a chasen and the result was a dark green colored tea. Then I added coconut milk and mixed that good. Last but not least I sprinkled a pinch of the acai powder. It seems to me that acai powder doesn't dissolve so easily and need a good whisk or blend. At the end of the last sip, I noticed some dark residue left on the bottom. It's a bit gritty or crunchy. I think it's from the seeds of the acai berry.\nThe taste is superb and healthy and it is organic as labeled.\n\n I have received a reduced price for the acai powder for testing/reviewing purposes.

And yes I did receive a discount for the matcha to test and review. All of my feedback and review are 100% honest and my own.\n\nThis organic matcha is a product of Japan and it smells absolutely amazing. Compare to the organic matcha that was product of China you can easily distinguish  the difference between them. The organic matcha from Japan smells like REAL fresh and good quality matcha. From this experience I will never buy matcha that are from China EVEN if they are organics. Compare to cooking grade matcha from China I'd say this matcha would be a ceremonial grade. LOL.\n\nThere is a notice on the back that it is best to consume the whole bag within 2 months upon opening. I might just squeeze it to 3 months because I will use this for drinking mainly since it tastes almost as good as ceremonial grade. Of course it is not ceremonial grade because you can tell by the color and smell. The color is still very green but with a slight touch of yellow. The smell is extremely green and fresh like real green tea. It took me into my imagination of nature\n\nAnyways lets get to the good part shall we. I put about a teaspoon of the matcha into a small bowl. I smooth out some of the clumps with the spoon. Slowly pour the hot water and mix until the matcha dissolves.

It is sweet but there is no added sugar. The only ingredients are banana and blueberry. It is certified organic and Non GMO. I do have to point out a whooping $20 a pouch is incredibly expensive. It's not surprising that the pouch is very light because the fruits are freeze dried.\nAlso the ratio of banana to blueberry is like 3:10 which is uncalled for. If you can afford it definitely give it a try, you won't be disappointed in taste wise.\nThe banana bits texture is similar to rice puffs or rice crispy. It is puffy and fun to bite into. While the blueberry are either crunchy or chewy.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCHOMPS Grass Fed Beef Jerky Snack Sticks, Paleo &amp; Keto Friendly, Whole30 Approved, Non-GMO Gluten &amp; Sugar Free 100 Calorie Snacks, 1.15 Ounce Stick, Pack of 24\nReview:\nLiterally just bought this jerky and it has an expiration date of 1 month.

Sweet at first sip. After taste was slightly bitter. However comparing it to the other ceremonial matcha that Ive tested it is a slightly lower quality. Therefore I gave it a 4 out of 5.\n\nIve tried drinking the matcha as it is and Ive also mixed it with yogurt which tastes amazing.\nA sifter helped out a lot so its very necessary. The best way to get rid of clumps is with a sifter AND adding the hot water little by little as you mix in the cup or bowl. You should not just pour all the hot water in at once because that would form clumps.\nI also did the same with the yogurt. I used organic whole milk yogurt (unsweetened) because it is healthy and has a very thick and creamy texture. I find that the only kind of yogurt fit for this high quality matcha. I used about 5 table spoon of the yogurt and 2 teaspoon of matcha. I sprinkled a little amount of the matcha on top of the yogurt and mix and a little more and repeat. The result is a light creamy green yogurt treat. You can add a little bit of honey and mix well.\n\nYou can consume the yogurt OR it can also be used for a face mask. Since matcha is anti-inflammatory,  high in antioxidant and full of nutrient it is perfect for treating acne. It will also give the face a natural glow.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nVanilla Bean Grinder, Whole Dried Vanilla Beans For Grinding Vanilla Powder Flakes Into Recipes, Drinks, Smoothies, Soups, Add Fresh Vanilla Flavor to Anything (2 Grinders)\nReview:\nThese bourbon vanilla beans are from Madagascar. The process is dried then cut up into small chunks.\nVanilla bean contains some minerals that the body needs, such as; magnesium, potassium and calcium. It is also known as an aphrodisiac.\n\nThe vanilla chunks itself smells very intense and appetizing. They do have a slight liquorice aroma.\nI added some to my cinnamon milk tea and I could taste the fresh vanilla flavor. I had some residue left on the bottom of my cup after finishing and I scooped the remaining powder and just ate them. They were tasty and a bit chewy.\nI noticed that vanilla ice cream I purchased in the past had these small dark particles are actually the same as what Im getting right now. These vanilla chunks will come handy for upcoming Summer treats.\n\nNotice that there is a built in grinder. Its a simple and convenient to grind the chunks into fine powder. Sometimes when I grind the chunks, I get a couple pieces that I can chew on. Its not the best grinder but its really convenient. The way I use the grinder is just like traditional pepper shaker that has a grinding mechanism on the bottom. You twist a couple times facing down and viola.\nIf you want to get more of a powder consistency you might want to use a different grinder or do it manually with mortar and pestle.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

This is excellent for sweetening hot beverages.  It tastes good and melts quickly.  My only problem with it is that it doesn't melt easily in cold beverages.  I use this in my coffee and hot tea, but I don't like to use it in any cold beverages because there is usually a undissolved residue in the bottom.  This is a very good sugar substitute and I like the convenience of the spoonable container.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy - Energizes and Supports Focus - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\nIf you love mint, then you will like this tea.

I was surprised at how much it reminded me of eating food with chewing gum in your mouth if you eat anything with it.  I like mine sweet and it isn't bad with lemon if you like it that way.  The mint is dominant and strong, so it may not be suited to all tastes.  I didn't really get an energy burst from it, so I can't really comment on how that feels.

The slices are also large rather than chopped up which makes them perfect for eating alone and easily chopped to add to other things.  The only problem that I have with them is the amount of sugar that they are coated in.  Mangoes are already a naturally sweet fruit and with so much sugar added they become more like eating candy than a good healthy treat.  My husband loves mangoes, but he thinks that these are too sweet.  We prefer less sugar on dried fruits in general and I like to get them unsweetened when possible.

When opening it , it has a strong smell much like soap or perfume. I tasted it straight up and thought it was weird and not something I would like. I then decided to make rice with it.  I used 2 cups of this with 1 cup Basmati rice and about 1/2 lb of  peeled raw shrimp, 1 tablespoon freeze dried shallots(Harmony house brand) , threw everything in pan and cooked it for the 10-15 minutes that the rice needed and wow!  It came out excellent! The flavor of coconut is there along with cilantro and slight hint of curry and tiny bit of heat.\n\nI also used this as a base for an Indian chicken curry and have to say it made it much better than usual. I prefer the Indian style curry to Thai and this is just perfect in it. As a soup base I would recommend equal parts of homemade chicken stock as this stuff is overpowering otherwise. By the way I used Patak's mild curry paste with this. You can spice it up and add more heat as you like as the others are just too hot for my taste.

The taste was fine. It didn't have a lot of appealing crunch to it, however - more of a dull crunch. I would like to see if Kashi offers a similar cereal with more protein, since I found that this cereal actually made me hungry in a shorter period of time as compared with when I eat a piece of toasted Mestemacher whole grain German bread (also available on Amazon)slathered with Smart Balance and ground chia seeds (lots of good fat).  The serving size of Kashi Vive is 1 1/4 cups with 170 calories per serving, 12 grams of fiber, 2.5 grams of fat, 10 grams of sugar and 4 grams of protein.  Total carbs are 43 grams with net carbs of 31 grams, so still a healthy dose of carbs.  Mestemacher sunflower seed bread in comparison is densely packed with whole grains, 140 calories per slice, 3 grams of fat, 0 grams of sugar, 6 grams of dietary fiber, 23 grams of carbs, so 17 grams of net carbs and 5 grams of protein. The bread also has 15% of iron which is naturally occurring due to the whole grains.  By comparison, Kashi Vive has 8% of RDA of iron and 20% each of calcium and Vitamin D.  It has whole grain and sesame flour, but is not 100% whole grain.  It also contains wheat bran, rice and yellow corn meal.\n\nIt's all about moderation, and this cereal is great as another means of adding fiber, calcium and Vitamin D to your diet.

I am even enrolled in the automatic subscription program, however I am in the process of re-thinking my decision. First off, there is quite a bit of information on the Internet that points to the fact that agave nectar is really a manufactured  and not a naturally occurring product - agave syrup - and that it is really a form of high fructose syrup.  There is also a concern about the plant source and how it could be potentially harmful to some individuals.  This product is expensive, and if you use it regularly, you may find that you are using quite a bit even if it is sweeter than sugar.  And if you are using a lot, shouldn't you be concerned about what you are really ingesting?\nGo to [...] for some insight into this.  Could it be that the sweetener that I have grown to love (and it tastes great - like a maple syrup substitute) and that I use primarily throughout the day in tea and in yogurt/kefir is worse for me or no better than table sugar?  Should I be frowning when my son uses pancake syrup and I choose to use raw agave \"nectar\"?\nI guess the old saying still rings true - if it sounds or tastes too good to be true, then maybe it just isn't as good as it appears to be.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nTofu Shirataki Noodles 10 Bags Angel Hair Shape\nReview:\nI bought 3 pasta shape varieties of these 8 oz. 2-serving bags of noodles in liquid in the refrigerated tofu section of our local grocery store for $1.99 per bag yesterday.  I am puzzled how they can be sold and shipped since the front of the bag states \"perishable - keep refrigerated\".  I opened the bag and smelled the noodles, and they did have a rather strange, strong odor.  I immediate poured the noodles into a strainer and then rinsed them under cold water.  I put them in a sauce pan with a small amount of Lorivo expeller-pressed peanut oil and let them sit for a while, stirring occasionally.  I decided to add Guilin chili sauce, garlic powder, powdered ginger, a small amount rice vinegar, water, 3 - 4 tsp. coconut sap sugar and 1/2 large can drained bean sprouts.  I warmed this mixture for awhile - maybe 20 or more minutes.  It worked!  I created a palatable side dish with a good- tasting broth and appealing consistency.\n\nI served this side dish with broiled tuna, mahi mahi, and a Spring greens salad mix with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.\nI wish that these noodles were available in larger sized bags at a lower price per serving, but $1 per person for two modest serving sizes per bag isn't outrageous unless you compare this with the cost of regular pasta.  I added the bean sprouts because the noodles alone didn't look like enough food for 3 people, and I thought that adding bean sprouts would offset any texture issues with the noodles. This recipe has now worked out twice with no real concern about cooking time for the noodles. Maybe the vinegar is the key, but the noodles are just like any other noodles when prepared this way and they make a great noodles with Asian-style broth meal or side dish.  And finally ... a use for those canned bean sprouts!\n\nUpdate:  I have now mixed these with baked tofu and Asian-style sauce. That combo worked out great.  Also I took the wide noodles, rinsed them and then put them in spaghetti sauce to simmer.  They tasted fine. Texture-wise, they will always be somewhat slimy and slippery and not al dente like well-prepared pasta, but otherwise, they worked out well. Just remember - just 40 calories - in an entire bag!

It does not seem to burn as quickly as olive oil or butter and it also seems that less is needed for frying - probably since it's easier to use small amounts since it is in solid form.\nThis coconut oil also worked well for sauteing tofu and broccoli with Bragg's liquid unfermented soy.\nIt's also tasty on a baked potato and I find that I can skip the salt and still enjoy the flavor.  You can also add it to rice or rice and beans or french fries for a tropical splash of flavor.\nI combined this coconut oil with olive oil to saute vegetables for a pasta dish and it worked beautifully.\nIt has mild, fresh flavor and a little seems to go a long way.\n\nApril 19, 2012\n\nStill loving this coconut oil.  It tastes great so you could literally eat a spoonful or two if you were hungry and needed instant energy.\nI packed it for a trip to Florida.  It was solid when I arrived, but liquified once I hit the warmer weather.\nIt also works great in a hot bath for instant moisturizing and it's the perfect after sun moisturizer.  It smells so good that you could use it as a very mild perfume and moisturizer just by rubbing it into your arms and legs until the oil is absorbed - seriously!\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Maxwell House had some nice instant.\n\nBut my family wanted a Keurig coffee maker, so--for the holidays this year--I bought one. The coffee that came with it was a Newman's Own blend. Pretty bold and tasty (better than instant and quite a bit better than my memory of Mr. Coffee). I recently ordered this through Amazon. It is not quite as bold as the Newman's Own k-cup coffee. But it does have a smooth taste that starts the day off nicely.

And this product--Starbuck's French Roast Dark--does the trick.\n\nFirst, it does feature a bold and full bodied taste. The coffee taste is robust and is a great way to start the day off.\n\nI have tried a good number of K-cup products--Starbuck's, Tully's, Newman's Own, and so on. Across these brand names, the bolder tasting coffees just work better for me, and I have discovered a number of very satisfying K-cups.

I'm not sure that my palate is capable of separating out such flavors, but the end result is surely a nice cup of coffee.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNewman's Own Special Blend Coffee, Medium Roast Coffee K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 80, net wt. 32.1 oz.)\nReview:\nThis is one of my favorite K-cup products.

Some of the family loved these and say they are worthy of 5 stars.  I find them too rich.  They are not bad.  They are just not my taste preference.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the very crunchy style of cheese straws made by Trader Joe's or John Macy's (both of which are available on Amazon).

These shrimp are sustainably wild caught so you don't have to worry about shrimp raised in a cesspool of antibiotics, bacteria etc.  They are wonderful and the price is right.\n\nI noticed a lot of reviews mentioning a fishy taste.  Because canned shrimp are cooked during the canning process they can taste very strong.  Canned shrimp should always be rinsed!  Empty into a fine mesh collander and *gently* rinse under nice cool water.  Shake gently a couple times and then tap them out on a couple of clean paper towels.  The flavor of these when rinsed is absolutely 5 stars.

Oregon Fruit Products has been in business for many years and (I believe) they are committed to high quality.

Otherwise, why not just get a good gluten free baking book and make one from scratch?\n\nMuch better luck with Pamela's mixes and Kinnikinnick.  I don't think Kinnikinnick has a yellow cake mix, but they do have white and chocolate...and you can't tell they are gluten-free in the least.\n\nAm not planning on buying this mix again, unless they improve it.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nMcCormick Steakhouse Onion Burger with Garlic, 3.12 ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nWe had these on grilled burgers and it was wonderful!  Spicy, but not too spicy, though it did add some zip to the burger.  There is definitely a good garlic and onion flavor and I could see using this on grilled chicken or as a spice when you make potatoes in those sealed  bags over the grill.  A definite MUST for camping and grilling events and weekends.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAnnie's Gluten Free  Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar Macaroni &amp; Cheese, 12 Boxes, 6oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI generally like Annie's products and really appreciate what they are trying to do, especially in offering gluten-free items.  That being said, I tried this Mac & Cheese made with rice pasta and was seriously underwhelmed.\n\nFor one thing, there weren't that many servings, especially if you are making this a main part of your meal.  Secondly, the cheese mix was very bland.  I had to doll it up with pepper and even some garlic salt before I could eat any of it.  Even then...there is no way this tastes in any way, shape, or form like regular Mac & Cheese.\n\nThe rice pasta cooked up nicely, which is a plus, but I would never use the cheese mix again.  So I guess I might as well, at that point, buy my own rice pasta and mix up my own cheesy mixture to go over it.  Takes more work, but why use something convenient like Mac & Cheese in a box if you don't end up enjoying the end product?\n\nDefinitely a pass.  Sadly.  If Annie's takes it back to the drawing board and makes the cheesy mix something tastier I would be willing to give it a second try.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\n Peanut Butter &amp; Co. The Bees Knees (Honey) Peanut Butter, Gluten Free, 16 oz Jars (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nI bought this on a whim and have now have started buying it on a regular basis.  The white chocolate flavor paired with the peanut butter is marvelous.  However, if you are looking for an overwhelming chocolate flavor then this might not be for you, because its a subtle mix.\n\nI've used this on waffles, pancakes, toast, crackers and even made wraps out of it.  You really don't need to add jam when you use this flavored peanut better.  In fact, except for raspberry, jams don't always go with this flavor combo.\n\nThe peanut butter is nice and smooth and not too sugary.  I'm glad I found this brand and, so far, this is my favorite one...save for the maple one they also make that comes in a close second.\n\nRecommended for both kids and adults.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Peanut Butter &amp; Co. The Bees Knees (Honey) Peanut Butter, Gluten Free, 16 oz Jars (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nWhen you eat a lot of peanut butter, you can get tired of the same old same old.  Then you take a chance on something new on the shelf and go...mmmm...where has THIS been?\n\nI bought this Mighty Maple peanut butter because it looked interesting.  I also bought the White Chocolate one at the same time.  I actually prefer the White Chocolate flavor slightly over this one, but the maple-flavored peanut butter is pretty good.  I think it's actually tad sweeter tasting than the white chocolate one.\n\nI have used this on toast, in wraps, and on crackers.  You really don't need any jam or honey when you use these flavored peanut butters.  The only thing I find missing with this one (and the other) is that I tend to like crunchy peanut butter, but for a smooth one...this comes in a close second to the Peanut Butter & Co White Chocolate in my opinion.\n\nI think the chocolate flavors might appeal more to kids, and the maple more to adults.\n\nI aim to try this one out when making peanut butter candy for the holiday season.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Lakewood Organic PURE Black Cherry Juice, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nThis black cherry juice is postively wonderful tasting.  It isn't too sweet or too tart and honestly tastes like you're eating black cherries...a terrific treat!  I also deeply appreciate that its organic and doesn't have all those added sugars like so many other juices out there.  Sure, this is more expensive, but its well worth it.\n\nCherries, like blueberries and blackberries and the like, are really really wonderful for your health.  I either drink this straight or mix it with sparkling water and make myself a tasty and good-for-you black cherry \"soda.\"  It is also a nice juice to use for making punch for a party.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTinkyada Brown Rice Pasta, Spaghetti with Spinach, 12 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI have tried many different kinds of gluten free pasta and Tinkyada absolutely makes the very best.  Not only does it cook like regular spiral pasta, but if you don't tell anyone they really can't tell its not gluten pasta.  I have a recipe I like to make that calls for spiral pasta and despaired of finding anything that would work, but I tried this one and it was great.  I took it to a picnic and, as I said, if I hadn't told the people it was gluten free (for my gluten free friends) they wouldn't have known.\n\nThis gluten free spiral pasta also does come in the veggie colored spirals, which is how I make a favorite pasta dish.  But it works just as well with these regular spirals, if not looking quite so colorful.\n\nI cook these spiral noodles as recommended on the package, but I also pull some out to check for the appropriate level of doneness, as I prefer them not to be mushy.  Rinse them off and cool down and add your chopped veggies, olives, pickled artichokes, maybe some pepperoni and onions, etc and some kind of dressing such as Italian and then you can keep in the fridge. You can also add some cheese if you want just before serving.  Makes a great potluck dish.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Then sealed it, slapped on a cheap stick on/or made it themselves off the pc.  I don't know but I am very disappointed.\nSave your money unless this is the kind of stuff your looking for, then go to Cisco (restaurant supplies) and buy a #10 can for $25.00.\nI grew up on a farm/dairy where my grandmother made this (preserves only) and it was thick, freshly cut, ripened rhubarb/strawberries and she refused to sell it.

Take those cookies, wrap them on your own wrap (gift wrapped by U ALWAYS impresses the receiver!>.at least me...it doesn't matter how it comes out; the wrapping, it's the thought someone would make the 'try') Hint: kids and husbands.\nAnyway, that's my opinion. $ is hard to come by, and as great-granddad use to say...'it all turns out the same way...and the same end.'\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nFerrero Rocher Fine Hazelnut Chocolates, Chocolate Gift Box, Diamond, 48 Count, 21.2oz\nReview:\nThey receive 3*. The price purchase is high-dollar.  The (hazelnut) chocolate has multiple flavors. Too many in my opinion, i.e., too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the food. The different flavors compete with each other for taste (dominance).  The nut overwhelms any chocolate and the cracked mixed nuts on the outside of the chocolate add distraction.\nIt ends up (in my opinion) as a soft (gooey) sweet 'something' with complex flavors.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nHills Bros Cappuccino, French Vanilla, 16 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIf you follow the instructions on the box, you WILL be disappointed! To make it taste as 'rich'\n as a cappuccino should taste, you have to DOUBLE the amount of mocha. It's very difficult to mix w/o making a mess. No matter how you make the brew you're going to have to break up a bunch of lumps of it; that didn't get mixed into the water, and that will cause a mess. Doing it inside a cup/mug you are going to have residue mocha marks all over the sides and top edges. You can't help it IF you wish to just drink a good cup of hot choc.\nThe best way I was able to use to accomplish the recipe w/o the mess on the sides of the mug, etc., was to put the steaming hot water in a blender, then set it on mix, putting the cappuccino slowly; you don't want the mix to hit the bottom! Once you get all the mixture in the hot water, and setting it on stir/blend, place the top on quickly and hit the fastest button you have on your blender.  Keep it there until you see no powder on the sides or the bottom, and no lumps in the water.\nI made the mixture, usng the double mixture w/hot milk, coz' if you use water, as they say, all you are going to get is muddy water (in my opinion). Right after I see the mixture is about hot choc. should look/a little 'thick' not watery, I immediately pour the mix into a mug and place the balance in a container w/easy spout and stick it in the fridge.\nWhen you take the remainder of the mixture you have left in the fridge, no matter how well you blended it, some of the cappuccino will have settled on the bottom. You will have to shake the container vigoriously, turning it upside down, then put it in your mug(s) and 'nuke'.\nA good cup of hot choc, I like, is somewhat a little thicker than milk, and leaves a froth on the top (so you can add your marshmellows; however, this brand, cappuccino, isn't going to work w/the addition.\nNow, all that I have written is what you will have to do no matter the brand name or flavor, size of mixture, etc., you are going to have the same issues that I have written.....that is what you get when you go 'instant'.\nThe ole' fashioned way of making hot choc. is my preferred method. You get your small pot, pour the milk into it and get it to boiling. Slowly had your hot chocolate. You stir in the pot using the same method I have written and you are going to have a good cup of hot choc.\nHot choc. should be made w/whole milk, but not h.and h.  Hot choc. is a cup of 'joy' for any time you wish to feel special....whether it be by yourself, wiith pet, or family. It's special. Taking the time to do it right makes the occasion even more enjoyable...if you don't hurry.

This review is for the 25% Less Sugar Chocolate Chip Granola Bars, sold by Amazon. I am a repeat buyer and purchase these at an awesome price through the Subscribe and Save feature!  I have been buying them for years and have never had an issue with quality or expiration date.  My one teen son is the primary consumer, but my husband loves them as well. My son loves the convenience and great flavor. He is always on the go with a busy work and school schedule. He grabs one for later so he not caught being hungry and needing to stop for fast food.

Upon arrival, I was instantly disappointed. What? A thin foil envelope of cereal? This was a very high price point for the product.\n\n  However, I am updating my review because I want to point out that this product is sold for $8.99 on their website with a discounted price for shipping on multiple items.  That price puts it right in line with a very fair price point.  If you go through Amazon, you pay for the convenience and that's okay as well!\n\n  It was time to taste test. I got out the measuring cup and poured my first serving.  Looked okay, smelled okay.  I'm afraid it was downhill after that. I personally did not have a taste for this particular product.  My love for coconut must not be that deep!  I understand we all have our own tastes and some are acquired.  It is a good low carb alternative for those that like coconut and want a cereal type of food to add into their diet.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nUtz Potato Chips, Sour Cream &amp; Onion, 1 oz Bag (Pack of 60)\nReview:\nMost people think of potato chips as a snack food. When growing up, my mom always had chips on her storm prep list. There she was getting gas, filling up containers of water, making sure there was cash in the house, etc. It always made me laugh when she purchased a bag of chips for the house! That was on her storm prep list!  During a recent hurricane, I had these sent to my sister. She was able to pass them out to neighbors who were all helping each other clean up and rebuild the destruction. They were a welcome sight! The chips were fresh and the individual bags made it so convenient!  Utz chips have been around for years and their name equals quality!

There are 300 calories per package, if you decide not to share with anyone. There is approximately 18 cookies per bag. I am fine with sharing, if you aren't, that's okay too.

It was smooth, creamy and sweet-tasting an instantly dissolved in hot liquids. I used it in my coffee and organic cacao drinks and it was better than half and half or  milk, by a long shot. Then the next batch I ordered was bad, even though the expiration date was not until 2016! The cream and liquid had gone sour and curdled, meaning they separated into a pulp and clear water and the water tasted off. It would not dissolve in coffee. Amazon refunded me and I ordered another batch. It came in different packaging (and also a 2016 expiration date) but was the same pulp/water consistency and sour taste. Although very convenient in small boxes, as it lasts and does not go bad, provided it is good when you first receive it, if you only use a little each day, but watch out if you get a 25-pack order, like I did, and they are all trash. That's just a waste of time and money and an upsetting experience.

Next, put real blueberries from my freezer in to the batter. The package said their dried berries would \"plump\" up. Nope, they just sorta rode the baking process out, the same size as they went in.

Raw seeds are flexible.  Most of the time, I  just eat them raw, because I'm on a salt-restricted diet.  On the rare occasions I want them roasted, I can do that wihout adding any salt.  When making them up for guests, I can add sea salt before roasting.  That's what I mean by \"flexible\".  Raw seeds can be kept  refrigerated for 1-2 months in a tightly sealed container without loss of flavor, but frozen can be kept for a year.\n\nNot only are they flexible, but they are outstandingly good!  I use them a lot in vegetable salads, but sometimes I just eat a handful or two as a light snack. If you want to dry roast your own, here's how I do it: Heat oven to its lowest temperature(160-170 degrees F.  Spread seeds in a single layer on a cookie sheet and roast for 15-20 minutes.  Higher temperature will cause break down of fats, creating free radicals you don't want.  (Commercially roasted are generally heated to much higher temps)  Remember, too, that roasted seeds have a shorter shelf life than raw.  So there you have it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSpicy World Shredded Desiccated Unsweetened Coconut, 2 Pound\nReview:\nI ordered the wrong product.

I started using this daily by putting one tablespoon in my coffee. Imagine my surprise when I stepped on my scale and was five pounds lighter. I'd heard that coconut oil helped to increase the metabolism but I didn't realize eating one bottle of coconut oil would help me lose five pounds. It seems ironic that you could lose fat by eating fat but that really seems to be what happened. I also noticed my brain functioning better and I seem more alert and in a good mood. This coconut oil can be used for medium heat cooking as well. It is unrefined, organic and virgin. What more can you wish for?

Using two teabags with 12 ounces of water produced a flavorless tea that didn't even have the hint of cinnamon let alone the fragrance of apples. Realizing that the weakness of the tea was the reason for my dissatisfaction I tried brewing the tea by using four teabags and 12 ounces of water. This produced a very acceptable tea with a full-bodied taste and the delicious fragrance of freshly picked apples. The ingredients in this tea include: African Rooibos, cinnamon, natural flavors, apple and chamomile. While this tea is not a five-star tea it is at least slightly comforting in the winter and if you brew it for longer than you would normally brew tea then you might find it to be delicious instead of disappointing.\n\n~The Rebecca Review\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nNature's Path Organic Chewy Granola Bars, Sunny Hemp Plus, 7.4 Ounce Box (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI hate making breakfast so these bars are perfect for winter mornings.

Either way I'm happy when I eat one because these are a source of Omega-3. I can't see why anyone would say these are bland. They are bursting with flavor. My box says best before OCT 2012 so it is a fresh box.

It really is that good. I also like that it is not overly sweet but just sweet enough to satisfy your craving. The vanilla flavor is also very subtle.

You can barely taste the ginger. I think this tea would be much better if they added some peppercorns which is traditional. What this tastes like is a weak black tea with little flavor. I normally love Numi teas but this one seems too weak for me and I used two teabags per mug. So if you like stronger chai teas this may not suit you. It needs a lot more spices in my opinion.\n\n~The Rebecca Review\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nALMOND JOY, Chocolate Coconut Candy Bar (Pack of 36)\nReview:\nPart of my husband's job is to spoil his clients by bringing them cakes or candy or sometimes even lunch.

This cultured ghee has been tolerable. The following is a suggested explanation on the product website:\n\n\"Why Cultured Ghee? Milk contains lactose, a natural sugar which gives it that delicate sweet taste. In order for the body to breakdown lactose into its basic components of simple sugars called glucose and galactose, an enzyme called lactase must be present. Many people lack this valuable enzyme in their digestive system causing a common digestive problem known as lactose intolerance. In order to metabolize lactose, lactase must always be present. During the natural bacterial fermentation process of milk or cream, lactose is converted into lactic acid. This makes for a much more digestible product for many people. Remember, generally ghee does not cause a problem with lactose intolerance. This is because during the ghee making process, the lactose is removed even if the butter used to make the ghee was not made from fermented cream.\"\n\nThe product website also states: \"Fermentation process produces flavor compounds such as diacetyl, giving this product a more buttery taste. Many people prefer the taste and aroma of freshly fermented foods.\"\n\nDiacetyl however is not entirely safe. In particular, its vapors are dangerous, as is noted on Wikipedia. Chronic exposure to its vapors is associated with lung disease and Alzheimer's. Technically, diacetyl can be removed, but there is no indication of PureIndianFoods doing this. Other similar compounds as a result of fermentation may also exist, but I can't be sure. As such, you probably do not want to heat this product much, or you may breathe in the diacetyl vapors.

I started adding chia seeds to my morning muesli/yogurt mixture for the fiber and omega 3s; according to the health fair at work I am not getting enough good fats. Whatever that means. Anyway. The quality is the same as it has been from other vendors, but at a fraction of the price. The bag is resealable, and heavy duty. I leave a tablespoon in the bag for easy access, and just dump a level tablespoon into my morning birdseed. I haven't really noticed any effects in the positive or negative from the seeds, besides that they always get stuck my teeth. I'm fairly certain that is a personal issue, and unrelated to the product.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nGreen Mountain Coffee, Breakfast Blend Decaf, Single-Serve Keurig K-Cup Pods, Light Roast, 96-Count (4 Boxes of 24 Pods)\nReview:\nI was pleasantly surprised by the depth of flavor of this coffee.

I always looked forward to a package of Pocky when I traveled to Japan.  Seriously, these were a whole lot better than a typical Japanese treat of a roll filled with red bean paste.  There just weren't many chocolate treats in Japan at that time.  And then, they started appearing in Asian grocery stores in this country.  Only the small boxes.  It was nice to buy a box now and then to remind me of Japan.  But now, they are showing up in Walmart and Costco.  Even though they are delicious they are not the treat they used to be--for me.\n\nThese seem a little different from the ones in Japan.  The chocolate is the same and the size is the same, but I think the stick is more pretzel-like in Japan.  They are still very good and I think I could eat them all day If I let myself buy one of the giant packages like the one above.\n\nThese were fun to look forward to in Japan or to buy in Asian supermarkets in this country to remind me of Japan.  They are good, but we have so many different treat choices in the U.S. that these don't seem that special now that they are everywhere.  Still, they might be different enough from the usual treats to make it big in the U.S.  Definitely worth trying!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNature Valley Granola Bars, Sweet and Salty Nut, Roasted Mixed Nut, 7.4 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI was tired of paying $1.50 or more for the delicious Kind Maple Glazed Pecan bars--when I could find them.

They look different, but they taste almost exactly like these wonderful cookiers even though we usually use finely chopped almonds when we make then.  These have chunks of pecans in them.  They really do melt in your mouth if you let them last that long.  Very buttery tasting.  They are crumbly, but if you are careful you will get every bite and not make a mess.\n\nFor once, I haven't looked at the calories.  It's the holidays.  I don't care.\n\nI bought my tin at Costco for a lot less than they are being sold for here.  You pay something for the convenience of mailing, but it's not worth it if they come as a can of crumbs.

The difference is that the cream or butter is much thicker, has whole coconut in it, and a very strong coconut flavor. You would not use the coconut manna for cooking. It is used more as a spread (which you wouldn't usually do with coconut oil) or can even be eaten by itself or made into a candy (because it is slightly sweet). It can be added to smoothies or used in many other creative ways. Think of it like whole coconut meat in a creamy form.\n\nThe reason I did not give this coconut manna five stars is because it is packaged in a difficult way. First of all, the container is plastic. In order to use the coconut manna, the container must be heated gradually to a very warm room temperature (say 80 degrees, I'd think) or else put in hot water for 30 minutes, stirred, and left in hot water for 30 more minutes. This is very inconvenient, plus the plastic container is not good for all of the repeated heatings.\n\nOther than that, it's a great product. It is very slightly sweet and tastes strongly like coconut. The consistency is a bit gritty or grainy due to part of the coconut flesh that is powder and has been reconstituted, but I found that fine, not off-putting at all. It's great all by itself, added to smoothies, or put into the freezer in molds for a whole foods raw candy.\n\nRecommended.\n****\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nThe Good Bean Chickpea Snacks, Sea Salt, Gluten and Nut Free, 2.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\n*****\nThese are my very favorite snacks, and I like this flavor. My favorite flavor is the the smoky chili & lime followed by the sweet cinnamon. Still, these are good! They are crunchy too. If you like to munch on simple wholesome snacks, you'll like this one, I think.\n\nEach bag comes with two servings in it for a total of (if you eat both servings, which I do) 280 calories, 4g fat, 46g carbohydrates, and 14g protein. This snack is gluten-free and uses non-gmo garbanzo beans. The ingredients are roasted chickpeas, evaporated can juice (ie, sugar), coarse salt, gum arabic, expeller-pressed canola oil (non-gmo), and Vitamin E. Half of the package (or one serving) isn't that much food, plus then you have the problem of keeping the rest of the package crunchy--if you leave them out in a bowl they will be not so crunchy the next day. I'm not sure why they add the sugar, but the taste is really fantastic without being sweet, so maybe it keeps them from being bitter.\n\nSometimes if I just want to have a delicious snack and I'm hungry and able to handle the carbs, I have these. They take a while to eat (they can be a bit hard on your teeth as they are very, very crunchy) and fill you up, plus if you drink lots of water (or other beverage) with it, you'll be really full afterwards.\n\nThey can be purchased alone in a six-pack here or as part of the sampler set. I have noticed mixed reviews here, so they are not to everyone's tastes; if you're not sure you'll like them, you can always order them as part of the sampler.\n\nHighly recommended.\n*****\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBare Natural Apple Chips, Cinnamon, Gluten Free + Baked, Single Serve Bag - 1.7 Oz (10 Count)\nReview:\n*****\nThese apple chips are tart, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.\n\nThese particular chips are only just barely sweet, mostly tart. If you want sweet apple chips, you can buy Fuji apple chips from the same company that are just as crisp and good. I like to mix both together for a sweet-tart combo.\n\nI would recommend (and it's way more economical) to buy these in bulk. If you like tart apples at all, and you like your chips crispy, then you have nothing to lose.\n\nNote: Each of the many dried fruits that are prepared and processed by Bare Fruits--each one is different--some are chewy, some crispy, but all are natural and vary as the natural fruits vary. In my opinion, their brand would tend to appeal to people who like things without added sugars and preservatives and whose taste buds and teeth can handle less processed food. The apple chips are very easy on the teeth, though...just so you know, not every product is like that\n\nHighly recommended.\n*****\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Green Tea Super Antioxidant - Helps Reduce Free Radicals - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\n*****\nWhat a wonderful tea this is!

It contains 21mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee).\n\nYogi Green Tea Super Anti-Oxidant makes me glad every day that I stopped drinking coffee and switched to teas---it's that good! If you've only tried commercial brands like Stash and Celestial Seasoning, and you think you don't like tea because they taste fake and full of strong flavorings, then you owe it to yourself to give this tea a try.

It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.\n\nI am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.\n\nYogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: \"Green Tea Decaf Kombucha uses the same delicious recipe as our Green Tea Kombucha but is naturally decaffeinated. Our organically certified CO2 decaffeination method removes only the caffeine while leaving all of the beneficial polyphenolic elements of Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) intact. This method also maintains the antioxidant properties and delicate flavor of our delicious, organically-grown Green Tea.* Unlike other green teas, this special organic Green Tea has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. This formula incorporates the natural antioxidant properties of Green Tea with a concentrated, purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm). This extract is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs and is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea. For centuries, practitioners of herbal medicine have used Kombucha to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach.* This convenient form of Kombucha can be taken daily for maximum health benefits.\"\n\nYogi Tea's use of \"Kombucha-Pure\", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.\n\nNote that Yogi Tea also makes a caffeinated version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea does include caffeine.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n*****\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Green Tea Super Antioxidant - Helps Reduce Free Radicals - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\n****\nThis Green Tea Energy from Yogi Tea is a \"natural energy boost\".

The taste is very difficult for me, and the kombucha comes across extra strong. I predict that you'll either love or hate the taste of this tea; try it first before you buy it in large quantities.\n\nI am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Green Tea Energy comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh).

I couldn't find it in any of my local supermarkets.  I LOVE cappuccino, hot and iced, one of my guilty pleasures since I try hard to stay away from coffee but I can't turn away a good cup of cappuccino.  The taste is great, NOT at all bitter, but the problem is it does NOT dissolve well at all in cold milk nor cold water.  What I do is heat some water first just to the point of enough heat to dissolve the mix and then I'll put in the refrigerator for an hour or in the freezer for 15-30 minutes.  Then i'll add the cold milk on top and it tastes wonderful!!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Kava Stress Relief - Eases Tension and Promotes Relaxation - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\nI LOVE the fact that Yogi did NOT add any type of mint herb again which just makes it taste bitter and makes me think i'm drinking wrigley's mint chewing gum rather than a tasty mild herbal drink.  I like the malted, carob creamy taste with pleasantly fragrant sarsparilla, cinnamon and ginger and hazelnut flavoring.\n\nI usually use rooibos tea for my anxiety to calm my nerves but when I saw this at my local Safeway and saw the ingredients, I knew I had to try it. It IS very calming such that I'm not so nervous or anxious and I can actually sleep well at night.  The kava root in it helps me think more clearly and less anxiously.

It has a strong aromatic fragrance from the licorice and it tastes pretty sharp and stinging from the black pepper and ginger but that just tells me it's working well and working on my body to help soothe and heal it.  I've given it to friends when they have colds and it's not a miracle cure tea but definitely a light healer for them in addition to their regular medicines.  I usually add my favorite tea (rooibos) into it which seems to make it taste a lot better and make me less stressed, less anxious, more awakened, and more relaxed.  I'll also add lemon and when it cools to lukewarm (heat kills the honey's enzymes), I'll add organic raw honey for even more healthful healing benefits.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAhmad Tea Blackcurrant Burst Black Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI have never tried Ahmad tea although I had heard Ahmad's brand quality was high and I was looking for a better blackcurrant tea ever since Twining's changed their blackcurrant tea formula into something with yucky flowery herbs.  Well, I couldn't taste any herbs in Ahmad's blackcurrant tea.  In fact, I couldn't taste/smell any blackcurrant at all.  The tea leaves OVERPOWER whatever blackcurrant flavor is there.  If you're looking for a blackcurrant tea, Ahmad's would not be a good choice.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Peach DeTox - Healthy Warming Blend - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\nI bought this for my mom to help with her arthritis that she keeps complaining about and wouldn't you know that she did NOT want to take it.  (She likes pure chinese green tea better.)\n\nSo I decided to take it myself since I had spent the money for it.  I HATE the spearmint & peppermint herbs (they remind me too much of the chewing gum and I wish yogi would take them out)-- Rooibos tea is my usual tea since it's sooo relaxing for my anxiety.  As far as taste, a lemon or orange flavored tea are more to my liking.

I usually have a hard time stretching but after a week of drinking this tea, I felt almost like an athlete as far as my joints were concerned.  The yucca root extract, cat's claw bark extract (uncaria tomentosa alkaloids), and devil's claw root extract in it certainly help with relieving any joint pain.  Also, I notice that I have fewer allergy sneeze/running nose attacks that I usually have and fewer colds.\n\nIt's an excellent tea if you want to relieve your joints and a great value for your money especially with Subscribe & Save.\n\nNote: if you have any loose herbs, muslin bags such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Cotton-Muslin-Bags-4x6-Inches-25-Count-Pack/dp/B009OFKLE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Cotton Muslin Bags 4x6 Inches 25 Count Pack</a>&nbsp;are great to pack them in without having to deal with trying to remove loose herbs in your teas and/or if you want to try different mixes of herbal bagged teas to get different medicinal effects or want to try different new herbs.  The bags help to easily remove the herbs, even if bagged and you don't accidentally drink any of the herbs which can be pretty yucky tasting.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nThe Republic of Tea Double Green Matcha, Gourmet Blend of Organic Green Tea And Matcha Powder (50 Tea Bags)\nReview:\nI love Republic of Tea's rooibos teas. I bought mine at Whole Foods.  Republic of Tea's teas quality rival Numi's but I think this rooibos tea is even higher in quality than Numi's since you get \"double\" the dose of usual rooibos so that you get a deeper taste of rooibos and you can see and smell the red rooibos powder lightly dusted off the teabags.  And the packaging is compact and attractive, great as a gift.  What I like about rooibos is that it doesn't have that yucky tasting flowery herbal taste of hibiscus, rosehips, etc that teas like Celestial Seasoning are notoriously known for.  Also, you don't have to feel like Superman trying to break into their teabags (like Numi's) since there are no enclosed individual protective packets around each tea bag.  Rooibos teas are nutty and mellow in taste.\n\nRooibos is healthy, great for skin ailments and calming for anxiety/nervous tension (which is why I love it so much), and it has no caffeine.  I double my health with it by adding raw unprocessed honey but it's really already slightly sweetened so that you don't need a lot of sweetener.  The tea is even better iced.  If it weren't so expensive, I'd get it more often but am forced with the lower cost alternative with Twining's rooibos teas which has a more \"hay\" taste/smell.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNumi Organic Tea Rooibos Chai, 18 Bags, Caffeine Free Herbal Teasan, Organic Rooibos Tea Blended with Chai Spices (Packaging May Vary), Premium Organic Non-Caffeinated Rooibos Chai Tisane, Red Tea\nReview:\nI was 1st introduced to Numi teas when I was drawn to the artistic, beautiful packaging of Numi's rooibos tea (the version with the artistic drawing of elephants in an african savannah) at Safeway supermarket as I needed a small food item but that had an expensive-look to serve as a \"community\" gift for everyday munching or drinking for coworkers at work for our small kitchen/computer/lunchroom at a prestigious company. After finding their rooibos tea so wonderfully tasting as well as relaxing to my nerves as I get anxious and nervous, rooibos tea has been my #1 breakfast tea to drink in the morning.\n\nTheir rooibos is much milder than you find with the more affordable Twinings tea but rooibos tastes a little nutty and you don't need sugar since it has a very mildly sweet taste. I, however, will also add organic raw honey to it to give me the benefits not only of the herb but also the benefits of the organic unprocessed honey which makes it a complete healthful breakfast tea for me.\n\nThere's a VERY TINY cut in the corner to indicate where to rip the teabag package but what I don't like about Numi teas is sometimes, the cut is not there and so that same small paper-plastic packaging that holds each tea bag is difficult to open OR when you rip it at the cut end, the rip still doesn't result in the opening of the tea bag pkg - it's protective with tough plastic on the inside and you NEED scissors or else you won't be able to open it unless you're Superman.\n\nBut what i love about their teas is that, like another reviewer posted, they don't taste like the usual flowery herbs (like licorice, flowery herbs/roots/leaves, mint, hibiscus, rosehips, etc.) which is what i hate about Celestial Seasonings Tea and why i moved away from Twinings blackcurrant tea when they changed the formula. So you get the benefit of the herb in the tea without the yucky flowery herbal tastes/flavors.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

These are packaged in individual serving bags for portion control and easy portability.  The almonds are coated in chocolate and then they have a dusting of red powder on them that taste like raspberry. They are a little messy to eat if you touch them with your fingers because the red powder goes everywhere. There is a lot of extra red powder in each pouch.

The flavor is dense chocolate but there is a bit of a chalk taste.\n\nThe bars are tiny, at one ounce per bar. From the photo on the box you would assume that the two pieces shown were one bar that was broken in half hence the broken off end part that is shown -- but actually what you see there are two separate bars with some crumbs removed from one end which is really, really misleading. Look at the other reviews for photos of the actual size of the bar compared to the packaging.\n\nThe one ounce bar has 120 calories and 35 grams of fat.\n\nThey are gluten free, dairy free, nut free, and soy free. They are non-GMO. They contain xanthum gum and gum arabic in case you need that information.\n\nI rate these 2 stars = I Don't Like It due to both the taste being not that great and the small size being not of good value.

I liked the taste of these salted cashews, they were a just-right saltiness level for me. I am allergic to soy though, and I don't need extra oils added into the cashews. I stared to wonder if I was wrong in my thinking so I did some research online and found that indeed some cashews use a salt water brine with no oil, and homemade recipes call for olive oil with salt. I am rating 3 stars = It's Okay as I don't like the oil choices in this product due to highly allergenic soy, the peanut allergy issue for those assuming cashews would not contain peanuts. We usually buy raw cashews or organic salted cashews.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSoFit Fruit and Protein Squeeze, Mango Orange, 4.2 Ounce (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nThis is our family's  first use of a snack of this type. You unscrew the cap and consumed this fruit pure, it is not a liquid juice but has more of a consistency of baby food. This is made from pear juice , fruit pure of blueberry raspberry, strawberry, and apple. It contains way dairy for the protein and honey for sweetness. It contains 20 g of carbs, of which 17 g are sugars. There are 6 g of protein. It is 100 cal.  It is gluten-free and is non- GMO.\n\n It can be served at room temperature or chilled and it is shelf stable to be stored at room temperature. I felt the flavor was a strong fruit taste such as you may have tasted in a protein smoothie powder product or  fruit flavors of a workout  electrolyte  replacement drink.  It does not taste like fresh real fruit to me. I personally wouldn't choose to eat this but my teenage son who is an athlete who is on a high-protein diet  of six meals a day liked the flavor and enjoyed this type of new to us snack food.  This son of mine refuses to eat dried fruit as a snack so perhaps this type of food product is a way to get some fruits into someone as in on the go snack food.  It's hard to rate food products when one person like loves it in another doesn't I will say 4 stars = I like it.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Certified Organic, non-GMO, Vegan Hazelnut Spread with Cocoa, Chia and Flaxseed, Classic Chocolate, 13-ounce\nReview:\nThis is a healthier alternative to Nutella and the consistency (spreadability) is better than Jason's as is the taste. Nutella was the first chocolate hazelnut spread I ever tried back when it was the only one on the market in USA. It was super sweet and made with corn syrup. I stopped eating it due to the unhealthiness of it and because to me it started to taste more like canned frosting. Jason's was the next I tried. Jason's is less sweet but needs a lot of stirring which is a challenge and it separates easily and can have some grit to it, it's not super smooth. Now I have tried Nutiva and it is amazing. The consistency is just like creamy peanut butter, no grit, smooth and spreadable. It has a deep chocolate taste and a good hazlenut flavor and it is not sickening sweet. This has 40% less sugar than Nutella.\n\nNutiva's ingredients that are notable are first, it's organic. Second, it contains sustainable non-problematic (no gorilla controversy) palm oil and coconut oil which help it have a smooth consistency. Mine arrived with no pooling or separation of oils. It also has chia oil which boosts the omega 3 count which Nutiva uses to promote this as a healthy food but let's not get carried away. This is what it is: a dessert like chocolate hazelnut treat, I am not looking to justify eating this treat by saying it's a health food. Nutiva is now my favorite chocolate hazelnut spread, it's a treat not a daily food for me. Highly recommended, 5 stars = I Love It.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Schr Gluten Free Chocolate Hazelnut Bars, 3-Count (6-Pack) \nReview:\nCrisp thin wafers with hazelnut in between plus dipped in chocolate.

They are a special treat. I rate them 5 stars = I Love It.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGo Raw Organic Superfood Sprouted Cookie Crisps, Sweet Crunch (pack of 6 bags)\nReview:\nI love these \"original\" flavor super cookies.

The ingredients are coconut, sprouted sesame seeds, and dates (all organic).\n\nHas no: GMOs, trans fats, or cholesterol.\n\nThese have a good flavor and a sweet taste, they don't taste un-sweet despite having no sugar or added fruit juices.\n\nOddly I find all the super cookie products by Go Raw to be filling and I actually often eat about 8 which is less than half a serving. The serving size is 18. They help satisfy my taste for something cookie like and something sweet, I am trying to eat grain free and to reduce sugar intake as I am pre-diabetic.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nButternut Mountain Farm 100% Pure Organic Maple Sugar Candy From Vermont, All Natural, 1.5 oz Leaf Candy, 12 pack\nReview:\nNot the very best maple sugar, but a pretty presentation.\n\nI do a number of gift packages, and am always looking for something that brings smiles.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Snack Praline Pecans Stand-Up, Resealable Bag, 5.5 oz\nReview:\nTasty, but a little too hard.  Pecans have a nice bite-feel, UNTIL they are coated with a sweet-salty mixture which hardens too much. Sell-by date? None that I could find.\n\nRecommendation: Try a smaller package and see how you like them. They ARE tasty.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nAnnie's Organic Snack Mix, Assorted Crackers and Pretzels, 9 oz Box (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThey must not use those tricky chemicals that leave you wanting more, more, more. I find these hit the spot and don't scream \"not enough!\" Your results, of course, may vary.\n\nGo particularly well with \"Big Bang Theory\" re-runs. But my interest in those is beginning to wane. Clearly, further research is needed.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKitchens of India Variety Sampler - 5 Flavors\nReview:\nVery nice variety pack. If you are away from your microwave, or don't have one, you will welcome the fact that these pouches heat in three minutes in boiling water. I sampled the red kidney beans curry last night, over rice. The tomato and onion sauce was tasty. The beans were softened but firm, and not dry.\n\nUnlike some Indian imports, it just lists \"spices\" in the ingredients. Ginger and garlic are listed separately.\n\nEach pouch yields two and a half cups, a decent amount. Unless you are a hungry hiker!\n\nIf you'd like it spicier, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sanskriti-Artisan-Pure-Natural-Spices/dp/B00K0EFMPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sanskriti-Artisan-Pure-Natural-Spices</a>.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCampbell's&nbsp;Chunky New England Clam Chowder, 15.25 oz.

I'm glad I did. As a hot breakfast cereal, it has a nutty flavor and a consistency similar to MaltoMeal, but is much better for you! The taste took a little getting used to (it's best with some milk and brown sugar) but I now like it quite a bit. I've added it to my breakfast mix, and alternate it with oatmeal. I've also started mixing in a tablespoon or two of flax seed from time to time. It also goes really well with fresh berries, or even frozen blueberries if you thaw them out first.\n\nWhile not quite supplanting oatmeal as my hot cereal of choice, Kamut has proven to be well worth the purchase; tasty, healthy, and organic. What more can you ask for from a product purchased on a whim?\n\n*****UPDATE 07/15/2010*****\n\nI tried making the \"Pharaohs Muffins\" recipe on the back of the package and loved it! I added chopped dates, raisins, and ginger, as well as a pinch of cinnamon. I also omitted the butter and sugar, and instead used apple sauce. The muffins turned out extremely well, and I'll be making them again. My wife also loved them, as did the coworkers I shared them with. They were pretty surprised to find out they clock in at 145 calories and have virtually no fat! So give them a try--they are worth it.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nGatorade Performance Series Nutrition Shake, Vanilla, 11-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese Gatorade nutrition shakes are easily the best tasting energy/nutrition/protein shakes I've ever tasted. The consistency is nice and smooth with zero chalkiness, which most energy shakes are ruined by. This one is just perfect as far as flavor and consistency.\n\nTo other reviewers saying the shakes have too many calories and not enough protein: these are not intended specifically as protein shakes. That's why they're called \"Nutrition\" shakes. If you want a specific protein shake, there are many of them available. I look at these as a light meal replacement or as an after work out energy replacement.\n\nAn interesting note: The cans are made of steel not aluminum; they are much heavier and stronger than aluminum cans which means they can be stored in a gym back and not accidentally get burst open.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGolden Valley Natural Buffalo Jerky, Original, 3-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nI've always thought buffalo jerky is much better tasting that beef jerky, as well as being leaner, and hence better for you. This buffalo jerky doesn't disappoint in the flavor department. It is slightly sweet, and has a very nice texture. However, some of the portions were a little dry and hard for my taste. There are also the occasional pieces of fat that I found in one bag. That is the disadvantage of buying 8 bags at a time online; you can't visually inspect what you're getting and not select bags that contain too much fat. You can contact Golden Valley and they will replace any bag that has too much fat for your taste, but expect 2-3 weeks before they'll deliver the replacement bag. Still, better customer service than most companies!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nRishi Tea Organic Black Tea, Earl Grey Loose Tea, 3.3-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI've always enjoyed a good cup of Earl Grey (especially when coupled with a good book) but have not really gotten loose leaf before. This Rishi Earl Grey is very nice, not overly heavy with no licorice undertones that I really find unappealing in some Earl Gery varieties. The tea takes four minutes to steep, and when done is quite aromatic. I would recommend this one without reservation.\n\n*****Update 10-10-2009*****\n\nI had to come update this review to express how much I LOVE this tea. It's easily one of the most enjoyable teas I've experienced (I'm drinking a cup of it as I update this review) and it always makes me happy when I brew a cup. This is a lovely tea!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTraditional Medicinals Organic Chamomile Herbal Leaf Tea, 16 Tea Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nTraditional Medicinals makes some really nice tea, and their organic peppermint is one of the best. It is strong; none of that weak fare you get at your local grocery store. You can really taste the peppermint oil on your tongue, almost as if it were brewed from fresh peppermint. It is not sweet; add some honey or raw sugar if you like it that way. Excellent for your digestive track and memory, peppermint tea is a wonderful study aid and will help you stay focused without getting the jitters of caffeine.\n\nA first class tea, and easy to recommend to anyone who enjoys herbals.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFruit Harvest Cereal, Strawberry Blueberry, 12.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is one of my favorite breakfast cereals. I think what distinguishes it most is the quality of the freeze-dried fruit. When combined with milk, the fruit rehydrates quite well, tasting neither soggy nor chewy like so many others.\n\nIt might not be the healthiest cereal available, but it is low in sugar, tastes great, and beats eating Grape Nuts or granola every morning. If you want a real treat, mix in some fresh blueberries...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nReeses Puffs, Peanut Butter, 22.9 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI'm at risk of obesity and cardiac failure because of this breakfast cereal. Not far down the ingredient list you can find \"crack cocaine,\" which gives these puffs their signature taste and addictive quality. I eat these for breakfast. I eat them as a snack. I eat them for desert. I hoard them from the other members of my family. These are high-risk behaviors that have started to concern those who love me. But they are all wrong. I don't have a problem. I have tasty Reese's Puffs. This \"Family Size\" is really an \"Individual Size.\" Because I am not sharing, not with you, not with anyone. I will shovel these tasty chocolate and peanut butter puffs down my gullet until I die a very happy man, likely not far in the distant future. So take your opinions and condemnation elsewhere, breakfast confection hater. Enjoy your flavorless wheat sticks and low fat yogurt in the dark comfort of your empty, soulless existence. I will chow down on my Reese's Puffs until I collapse face-first into my cereal bowl.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

The cellophane bag they're packaged in is 'cheap' cellophane, and split open during travel.  Or, someone in the handling process got hungry, as there were only 31.32 ounces of the 32 ounces (2 pounds) advertised.  I weighed it as a way to decide if I thought the candy had been tampered with... I doubt it.  Other than someone having a taste of it.  But, for actual advertising purposes, that may want to be addressed.\n\nNothing looked tampered with (but if you're somewhat paranoid, and get an open bag of 'rolled' candy, this may bug you).\n\nOtherwise, I like these small rolls for portion control, and I got just what I figured I would with bulk packaging. :)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nM&amp;M'S Easter Milk Chocolate Candy Party Size 42-Ounce Bag\nReview:\nI'm repackaging these into small portions to put in my emergency stash... the chocolate is sealed in sugar, so shelf life in a 60 degree basement (in a sealed bucket) should be good.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nGourmet Russian and Ukrainian Chocolate Candy Assortment, 1 lb/ 0.45 kg by Gourmet Gifts\nReview:\nI really wanted to like these.

The taste of Almond Extract is pretty overwhelming.  Still, after one bag, I kinda got used to it.  These are very small squares with 15 pieces per bag came to .49 per piece.  Even at that, I had them on my list to buy additional bags until I was notified the price would now be .59 per piece.  At the point, I decided they weren't that good after all.

I don't think it's the sweetener either, because their Juicy Fruit tastes just like the old time juicy fruit.  They must have changed the 'secret recipe' for the Spearmint and they absolutely ruined it! It used to be my favorite flavor, but evidently it's gone forever. They even changed the package to be sharp looking.  The old time spearmint package was almost all white.

Since I have been using this spice in many foods, I love the taste of it and the fact that it gives my white sauces that GOLDEN YELLOW color, turns plain white rice into yellow (Saffron looking rice).\nThis particular spice not only tastes wonderful, it is so healthy to eat. I went to Google and typed in benefits of turmeric and was amazed at all of the benefits of this tasty herb! And so you will know---Turmeric is what gives MUSTARD it's yellow color and wonderful flavor!\n\nIf you love that special taste in foods that people ask you \"What is in the dish, it tastes great?\" then you may want to consider this.\nFor the price and the quality, this is the best one that I found online.\n\nStorage - I placed the spice into a zip-lock back and sealed it tightly and then placed a rubber band on it. So I will remember what the bag has in it I place the cut out of the Spicy World label on top of the bag with scotch tape.\n\nHINT: Be careful handing this spice with your fingers as it will stain your fingers a mustard yellow. Also if spilled onto your clothes it may stain. I wear an apron in my kitchen and scrub my hands after using this herb.\n\nHighly recommend this!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Five Spice Powder, 1.92-Ounce Bottle\nReview:\nFor me, I regularly prepare Oriental dishes, mostly Refried Rice, Lo Mein, and Stir Fry dishes. Of course I try to duplicate that restaurant Oriental taste as much as possible. I watch many cooking shows on TV and on SEVERAL of the shows, chefs used Five Spice Powder Seasoning. Thus one has so many positive reviews, I decided to try it for myself.\n\nThe results for me is just amazing and I found my Oriental dishes have much better flavor as I am now using thus spice regularly. In addition to using it for Oriental dushes, I tried this in my spaghetti and even in my a Taco meat. Wow, these dishes had more flavor and much zestier!\n\nHowever, what you need to know us that this Seasoning is very, very strong. When I cook with it, I just use a very tiny pinch of it. That way it is not overpowering in her dish.\n\nThe taste of is is sweet, sour, hot, yet comforting. In my opinion, it brings to my dushes the question What is that special flavor in this food? Since I add just a tiny amount of this seasoning, the food is a delight I have really received compliments.\n\nOne more thing: Thus spice is in a glass jar and closes up well to lock in the marvelous flavor.\n\nHighly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNu-Salt Substitute Shaker, 3 Ounce\nReview:\nPersonally, I love the taste of salt, and love to eat salty foods. Hence, I found myself eating too much salt and my fingers began to swell, especially the first thing in the morning. So I realized that I was eating and retaining too much salt! Then a couple of weeks ago, I was in my local market and noticed the Nu-Salt Salt Substitute and decided to give it a try. The taste I find is very pleasant and very similar to that of salt. Moreover, I noticed is now that I can sprinkle lots of this on my food and this satisfies my need for that salty taste, and my fingers no longer swell. And best of all, I lost 4 pounds due to water weight that came off!\n\n**May I suggest that you DO NOT use this while you are cooking foods, instead, wait until the food is cooked and at the table then add this Salt Substitute. It goes much further and last longer this way.\n\nThis is a superb product and if you love the taste of salt like I do and you are on a restricted salt intake diet, this is the product to buy!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFiber One Chewy Bar, Oats and Peanut Butter, 1.4 Ounce, 5 Count, Pack of 12\nReview:\nFor many years before I tried this Fiber One Oats & Peanut Butter Chewy Bar, I was Peanut Butter Candy Bar junkie! For that matter, anything with peanut butter in it was just want I wanted. However, I realized that I need more fiber. So decided to give these chewy bars a try and this is what I found:\n\n1) They are sweet enough to make my sweet tooth happy.\n2) They have plenty of peanuts and peanut flavor to suit me.\n3) Love the chewy texture, it is more like eating a regular candy bar, but I do not feel the guilt.\n4) These are a necessity for me as I keep one in my purse at all times to keep with me as I have low blood sugar and have to eat often. This keeps something in my stomach until I can eat a regular meal.\n5) Fiber: At 4.5 grams, this is a nice serving. And it works well for me as I eat other foods with fiber during the day.\n\nGreat product!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHormel Compleats Swedish Meatballs, 9 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis is the best of the Hormel Compleats line of foods! Great tasting also! For me, a few weeks ago I picked up nearly every variety of the Hormel Compleats at my local store just to see which ones I prefer. This one the Beef Pot Roast is wonderful and my favorite of this line. For me, I add some garlic powder, a little black pepper and maybe seasoned salt to enhance it. Then I eat this with 2 slices of bread for a really nice lunch. Keep in mind this is FAST FOOD/Convenience food yet it still tastes good for that type of food. Does it taste like homemade? No, but more so than other brands I tried.

So this soup I highly recommend this soup for these reasons:\n\n1) Noodles fit easily into a tablespoon or soup spoon!\n\n2) Plenty of noodles in this soup.\n\n3) Rich chicken flavor (no chicken pieces or veggies in this but still a wonderful flavor).\n\n4) Filling!

What I do to make it even creamier is to add extra milk in place of the water. After it is cooked, I add just a little more milk and if they are available some fresh strawberries.

I do make it very strong using the 8 cup setting while grinding it for about 3 cups in my big mug. I typically add a dash of liquid Coffee Mate, and with this I wanted 3 dashes.\n\nIt's not bad coffee, it just had a different taste that I didn't care for. In 35 years I've tried a lot of coffees and I can like Folgers Columbian to espresso, I prefer it dark roast and I'm not real fussy about coffee like some are.\n\nI won't tell you not to try it, because this blend may suit you fine, it just had a something about it's taste that didn't work for me.

Check on that though, because pricing does fluctuate here on the big river.

Just because how the heck could I do a real review without doing it. Just like when I used a little creamer though, this coffee is so smooth that it's like the difference between drinking good bottled water instead of from the tap it's so smooth.\n\nIt's pretty dark without the bitter taste that you can get from dark roast at times. Please don't think me crazy, but I use the recommended amount of coffee for 8 cups to make 17 ounces for my morning mug that goes in a 20 ounce mug, so that it's very full with an ounce and a half of creamer like Coffee Mate added, but I often use the cans of evaporated milk also.\n\nIf the coffee isn't good when it's made strong like this, it can be brutal to drink. But the Love Buzz (I like the name too) the Love buzz isn't bitter and it's so free of acid that it seems impossible. I expect acid when I make it so strong and that's why I normally use a dash of creamer.\n\nMy French press is at my other home where I'm not, so I've been using my Gevalia drip with the metal screen as a substitute. This works out pretty well and I've held off on picking up another press, because I've already been here longer than planned. I want to fly back with a bag of the Love Buzz just so that I can press it though because I want to try that so badly.\n\nSo I've got more on the way because as of today, throughout my 35 years of drinking coffee this is my new favorite, just the best.\n\nDon't even think about if you maybe want to try it, it can't be everyone's favorite, but I don't think that you'll be disappointed.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Just pour the noodles into a microwave safe bowl, add 2/3 cup of water, heat for a few minutes, add the powder, stir, and you get what tastes exactly like the kind your Mom used to have to boil on the stove. Easy to make, tastes like the old fashioned version, and handy to have...they store well and are great for a nice and easy, nutritious snack for kids of any age. Packed in individual light plastic pouches, the noodles stay dry until needed, and the cheese pouches are in durable envelopes which keep the powder fresh and ready to use for quite a while, so the product can be stored until needed for weeks and perhaps longer. Sometimes, to reduce the salt in this product, I make two pouches of noodles and add only ONE of the powder packets...and a dash of sesame oil for a bit more flavor...They are handy to have around the house for kids, guests and instant dinners...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nChocolate Hazelnut Butter by Justin's, Organic Cocoa, No Stir, Gluten-free, Responsibly Sourced, Packaging May Vary, 16oz Jar\nReview:\nFar too expensive.

Unfortunately, they aren't as good to me.  They are quite salty, and not as much licorice flavor as the cats.\n\nThe package says \"Firm with just a hint of salt.\"  It tastes like just a tad more than a hint of salt to me.  Prefer the cats.\n\nEdited to add May 30, 2013:  I have now become addicted to these salty coins.  I completely choose them over the cats now.

These are firm little cats about the size of the tip of my little finger, but boy do they pack a punch of flavor!  I like the fact that they are firm.  Too soft is not good, in my opinion.  The flavor is pungent.\n\nEach serving is 15 pieces, but this licorice is so satisfying, two pieces are good for me.

We train our palettes, for better or for worse.\n\nI have been eating Ezekiel for at least 20 years.  I don't eat sugar, artificial sweeteners, refined grains, red meat, or artificial anything, and this cereal tastes sweet and crunchy and nutty to me. I usually eat it with a handful of chopped walnuts, cut up a banana or peach, and add almond milk. It's low on the glycemic index, which is also an enormous plus if you're trying to eat healthy. And it's filling; unlike when you eat those sugary cereals, you won't be hungry in an hour.\n\nWhen I walk into the grocery store, and 99% of the groceries are all about sugar and carbohydrate addictions and foods all pumped up with chemicals and addictive substances, I feel discriminated against.

You can add various milks and sweeteners, but mostly I take mine straight and think pleasant thoughts.\nBut I'm at a point in my life where sleep isn't a sure thing, and I won't use drugs to make me sleep that would have catastrophic side effects, so I take a cocktail of supplements that are (knock wood) helping me slip into that nether world of dreams and rest, but it comes slowly if at all, and I've tried several herbal blends of chamomile, passion flower, etc., without much success.\nI found this one, while searching for something else and decided what the heck, and ordered it. It's not instant, as in something that will conk me right out, but if I drink it an hour or more before bedtime, it takes the edge off the day. Linden Flower appears to have a ton of benefits, everything from taming high blood pressure, to clearing mucus and yes, treating insomnia.\nI thought I'd look at some other Linden teas, but the Lemon Balm and Hawthorne in this one seem to work together, so I'm not going to try anything else just yet. Also it's organic, which is pretty high on my list of priorities. The taste is about like all herbal teas, grassy, and I definitely don't wake up feeling drugged. I would buy it by subscribe and save or in multi-packs if they were available.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nChios Mastiha Tears Gum Greek 100% Natural Mastic Packs From Mastic Growers (50gr Small Tears)\nReview:\nI'm placing my second order for this gum. It's definitely helping my digestion issues, and I'm sort of addicted to chewing it. It's not like the gum we usually chew, and there's a bit of a learning curve. You have to test each of the tears by chewing down on it carefully to see how moist or dry it is. Some will break into tiny shards, and some will be so sticky you'll spend the better part of the day cleaning it off your teeth. I've found that what works best for me is to save a little piece of my gum from the previous day, start chewing it to get it softened back up, and then add a piece or two of new Mastic Tears to it. My jaws get a real workout. The first few times they were actually a little sore, so I guess it's good from that standpoint as well.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It looks like coarse white sugar dyed brown, or dark brown sugar that's loose and dry.  It smells like the husk of a coconut and tastes sweet and nutty.\n\nI baked a batch of cookies - half using regular sugar cane sugar, the other half using coconut sugar.  Then, I asked the family to compare without telling them which was which.  They chose because they had to, my husband asking if it was a trick question.  In the end, my daughter like the coconut sugar cookies.  My husband and son chose the white sugar cookies.  Like the rest of my family, I honestly couldn't tell the difference.\n\nI made chicken wings in the oven.  It's a recipe I've used for years using soy sauce, honey, and sugar.  This time, I substituted coconut sugar.  Here, the difference was noticeable.  I could smell and taste the bolder, nuttier flavor.  I didn't tell the family I had changed the recipe, though, and no one commented on it.\n\nI'm going to keep experimenting with coconut sugar.  It's not going to replace my sugar cane sugar, because there are times when I don't want that nutty flavor or brown color coming through.  It's a definite green light for cookies, as no one can tell it's even there.\n\nThis product was provided for review by Viva Labs.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nOrganic Chocolate Chip Pancake and Waffle Mix by Birch Benders, Whole Grain, Non-GMO, 16oz\nReview:\nI served these to my family last night and they got an overwhelming thumbs up  for their hint of cinnamon.

I'm using it on my skin and lips, which makes me smell like the tropics.  The only problem is I can't seal up the packet.  There's way more in it than I'll ever need for one application.

Nope, it's too runny to be lard, and too thick to be oil.  I guess I could use it for cosmetic purposes, but that would mean dipping my hand in it.  Instead, I fried up some sausage.  This stuff heats up well and fries great.  I'm no fan of coconut flavors, but this didn't taste like coconut at all.  I like it, but I wish it came in a squeeze bottle.  It's about the right consistency for that.\n\n_____________\n\nUPDATE 5/19/16:  After cooking up some foods with milder flavors, yes, I can taste the coconut.

Bag &mdash; Organic, Non-GMO, Fair Trade, Gluten-Free\nReview:\nFor those who want to get all the benefits of dark chocolate without any processing, this is for you. These are raw, natural \"nibs\" of cacao. They aren't sweet like chocolate candy, and they can take some getting used to, but you don't need to eat a lot of this food to get the health benefits, only about a half teaspoonful of them per day.\n\nOver the last four years there have been dozens of scientific studies analyzing and confirming substantial health benefits from a small amount of dark chocolate consumed daily. The latest findings from a Harvard study released in early 2011 indicate that as little as 6 gm. of dark chocolate (about 30 calories) is a sufficient daily \"dose.\" That means you need very little of pure chocolate like these nibs.\n\nThe original German studies in 2007 used&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ritter-Sport-dark-chocolate/dp/B000PAM5DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ritter Sport dark chocolate</a>, but I haven't so far been able to discover which kind of Ritter's dark chocolate was used by the researchers. However, since Ritter's only makes two types, 50% cacao and 71% cacao, this product's content of cacao goes far beyond the parameters of the dark chocolate used in that study.\n\nThe health benefits of dark chocolate are due to the flavonoids contained in cocoa. Flavonoids act as antioxidants in the body, which both prevent and reduce inflammation. Over many years of medical research, inflammation has been found to contribute to or directly cause a host of diseases, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and cancer, as well as autoimmune diseases like arthritis.\n\nFlavonoids are found in the pigments of fruits and vegetables which give them their color. The darker and deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the greater the amount of flavonoids it contains. Cocoa is derived from the dark-brown cacao bean, which is the fruit of the tropical tree, theobroma cacao. In any chocolate product, such as this one, the higher the percentage of cocoa/cacao, the more flavonoids the chocolate contains.\n\nDark chocolate such as this product is better for your health than milk chocolate because it contains more antioxidants, which are good for you, and less sugar, which is not good for you--especially if you have diabetes or are struggling with your weight.\n\nThe FDA defines categories of chocolate based on how much cocoa/cacao is in a given product:\n1. Unsweetened chocolate with no additives is 100% cocoa. Most all brands of unsweetened baker's chocolate fall into this category. Their ingredient list will state simply, \"chocolate.\" This product is unprocessed cacao.\n2. Bittersweet chocolate contains 35-99% cocoa (35% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. There is a large range of products in this category, and the product names reflect the amount of chocolate they contain. Unsweetened chocolate is very bitter, and the more cocoa in a product, the less room for sugar, and the more bitter it will be. In order to avoid frightening off customers who are used to sweet chocolate, marketers often substitute the words \"dark,\" \"extra dark\" or \"intense\" for \"bitter\" if that word is not paired with \"sweet,\" for example as \"bittersweet\" or \"extra bittersweet.\" This product lies at the top of this range.\n3. Sweet chocolate contains 15-34% cocoa (15% is the minimum), and it must contain less than 12% milk solids. It is sometimes also marketed as \"dark chocolate,\" even though it has a much lower percentage of cocoa solids than bittersweet, which can cause consumers, in such cases, to purchase a product with less cocoa in it than they realized they were getting. Everything else besides the cocoa and milk solids is essentially sugar.\n4. Milk chocolate is only required to have a minimum of 10% cocoa, a minimum of 12% milk solids and 3.39% milk fat. The rest is sugar and milk.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSincerely Nuts Dried Pineapple Chunks - Two Lb.

I was interested to see that this flour has far, far less fat in it than ground up coconut flakes. I can only assume that this is because the coconut pulp that is dried to be ground into flour has first been squeezed to remove coconut oil, which is sold separately.\n\nI use this flour in muffins, soup, and vegan ice cream. It tastes almost as good as ground up coconut flakes for these three purposes, and it saves a lot of calories.\n\nMy recipe for a really creamy, delicious, tropical ice cream is:\n\n1 ripe mango, peeled\n1 ripe banana, peeled\n5 large frozen strawberries\n1 cup fresh or canned pineapple, pre-frozen in ice cube tray\n1/2 cup coconut flour\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract (I make my own)\n1 teaspoon stevia powder\n1-1/2 to 2 cups frozen ice cubes (I freeze green tea that I have sweetened to taste with stevia)\n\nI blend all the non-frozen ingredients in my Vitamix first. Then I gradually add in the frozen ingredients, blending on high until it is well mixed and the consistency of a Dairy Queen Blizzard. Yum!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGarden of Life Greens and Protein Powder - Organic Raw Protein and Greens with Probiotics/Enzymes, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Chocolate 22oz (1lb 6oz/611g) Powder\nReview:\nThis is a high-quality, meal-replacement supplement. It tastes pretty good for a vegan product. Every vegan protein powder I've ever tried has been really awful tasting. This product does have a somewhat grainy texture, however, it mixes well using a mini-whisk or a fork, and of course there is no problem at all if you use a blender. I mixed it into room-temperature, purified water, and I did not feel the need to try it at a later time with herbal tea or almond milk to improve the taste, as I do with regular, vegan protein powder. It tasted fine just with water.\n\nThis product is certified USDA organic and non-GMO. It is vegan, Kosher, dairy-free, and soy-free. It also contains probiotics, enzymes and fiber. It is sweetened with stevia, and has no bitter aftertaste. In short, there are no bad ingredients at all and plenty of excellent ones.\n\nThis product is fairly expensive, at about $1.50 per serving, but that's not too bad as far as healthy, meal-replacement products go. I found it quite filling.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Natural Products Organic Bac'Uns Bacon Flavored Soy Bits - 1 lb\nReview:\nThese are a delicious, organic version of soy, vegan, fake-bacon bits. They taste wonderful on salad, and I especially like them when I make toast, spread homemade guacamole on it, and sprinkle thesse Bac'Uns on top. Yummy! They also taste good sprinkled over potato salad.\n\nOn top of all that, they are a terrific, low-calorie source of protein.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEnjoy Life Baking Chocolate, Soy free, Nut free, Gluten free, Dairy free, Non GMO, Vegan, Paleo, Semi Sweet Mini Chips, 10 Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese vegan, mini chocolate chips taste delicious and they are terrific to bake with. I had not used mini chips before, and they work great for better distribution of chips throughout the chocolate chip cookies I made. Below is the recipe I used, which is one I developed for myself after a lot of experimenting with ways to avoid using sugar yet still have cookies taste sweet. I have included some pictures of the cookies I baked as well as what the dough looks like when made in a food processor. I will definitely purchase these chocolate chips again!\n\nVegan Chocolate Chip Cookies\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees.\n\nMix these dry ingredients together well or sift them together if preferred:\n\n2 cups whole wheat pastry flour\n2 tsp. stevia\n1 tsp. baking powder\n1/4 tsp. sea salt\n\nPuree in food processor:\n\n1 medium, peeled and cored apple (or 1/2 cup applesauce)\n60 gm pitted dates\n1/2 cup coconut oil\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract (I make my own)\n1/4 cup maple syrup\n\nGradually add in 1/2 of the dry ingredients to the pureed mixture in the food processor.\nRemove the pureed mixture from the food processor and place in a bowl.\nStir in the rest of the dry mixture and add last:\n\n1 cup Enjoy Life Semi-Sweet Chocolate Mini-Chips\n\nFor convenience, I use my toaster oven rather than turning on my regular-sized oven (easier to deal with and uses less electricity). As stated above, I preheat my toaster oven to 325 degrees. I use a 1-tablespoon-size melon-ball scoop to measure out balls of cookie dough onto a greased silicone baking sheet which is specifically sized for a toaster oven. I press the cookie-dough balls flat. I then bake the cookies on the toaster-oven rack on its top level for 9-10 minutes. The cookies have a moist and chewy texture.\n\nThis recipe makes about 44 cookies at approximately 75 calories each.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

About the only the only thing I don't use it for is high temp frying because it tends to smoke up the house.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nVega Protein &amp; Greens, Plant Protein Shake, Vanilla,net weight 26.8 ounce,25 servings\nReview:\nWill give you the short and skinny from someone who bought-paid full price.  My requirements were:  low in fat, low in fiber, low in cholesterol, low in sugar, plant based proteins and with all that, it had to play nice with my pancreas.... oh, and with all that, I expected it to taste half way decent.\n\nVega Protein & Greens ticked all the required needs and even tastes all right-  As far as taste, it's a tad bit on the powdery/chalky taste for me, BUT, I think that's a small price to pay since it meets all the other requirements.\n\nSomeone who evidently received this free for a review made mention that it's pricey.  I'd have to ask, \"compared to what?\"  I have been paying $55.00 for another brand and yes, that brand tastes less chalky to me, but still Vega is doing what I need it to do, it fulfills all the requirements I had,and so as long as they don't change up the formula, I most likely will continue to buy this product.\n\nI also forgot to mention it dissolves very easily, not many protein powders do, at least not without a blender or bullet type device.  The Vega Protein & Greens dissolves easily with just a shake or two.  That's a nice PLUS.\n\nUPdate:\n\nThe price has gone up $9.00 since I bought the first one.  There are equally good products out there for a little less with more servings... After writing the original review and saying I would buy again.  with the price jump, I most likely won't.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nIsland Fresh Superior Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, 54 Ounce\nReview:\nI was asked to sample Island Fresh Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil obviously due to reviews of other coconut oils I have purchased.  I buy and use a LOT of coconut oil... some brands I've liked, some I would never buy again.\n\nI DO NOT keep any other oil in the house other than Coconut oil, so basically I use it for everything in the kitchen for cooking and I even use it on my Formica counter tops, around the house, on my skin .... I'm a coconut oil fanatic.  The one thing I DO NOT use this type oil for is my essential oils.... I buy a cheaper version for that one application.\n\nIsland Fresh Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, so far, has passed all my tests of what I will buy more than once....  In a nutshell:  it smells good, tastes good, feels good and in its hardened state is not 'pithy' feeling like a few other oils I've purchased.  It's also competitively priced ... who could ask for more?

Always ready, you don't have to think to soak them the night before.  They can be tossed into just about any vegetable dish for protein and flavor. They love garlic and good olive oil for seasoning.  If you like dips, they'd make a great base.  At just over $2.00 a can, the Amazon price on these is great, too.  No BPA in the can, and Eden Foods is a wonderful little company that I feel good supporting.  (No, I don't own or work for Eden Foods.  Don't even know anyone who works there.  They are domiciled in the state where I spent my earlier years, but I've never even been to the city of their location.)\n9-9-14 update.

I hesitated to review this for selfish reason because I want it to be in stock when I want to order more. I am so excited that I could find it on Amazon.  Previously, I would only order my olive oil from a company in California, but for this olive oil I overcome my environmental scruples and buy something shipped in from another country. I am an experienced cook. I am blown away by the flavor of this olive oil.  For those having trouble will spillage, pull the spout up straight until it is fully extended before you twist off the cap.  This is a good, useful cap.  In the old days you had to open a tin of olive oil with a can opener, and then it was messy.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Their coconut oils smell really good with a fresh, coconut scent and taste great too.\n\nI was surprised because I use other NOW products and am happy with them.

It's not bad per se, I like bitter but this spice did not seem 'rounded' and pleasant on its own to me.  There's no aftertaste that I can detect and my food still tastes good using it, but I can tell it's not the usual brand I buy.\n\nI bought this to get bulk for the money since I blow through Turmeric at a ridiculous rate.  I use A LOT of the stuff, in just about everything savory to assist with joint health and because I love the taste of turmeric.  I also love the color it imparts to food.  I will finish the package but will likely try another brand the next go around.\n\nIf I had to pick between having this and none, I would buy again.  Because of the price point, I likely will buy again, many times, just not as a first choice.\n\nI will update this review after I've had a chance to try the tea recipes listed in other reviews.  It just might change my mind!  Hopefully I'll end up liking this better (it wouldn't be the first time that a product I didn't like at first ended up being my favorite goto so, we'll see).\n\nHope this helps.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 33.8 fl oz Container (Count of 6)\nReview:\nI love coconut water and was quite pleased with my old brand (98% coconut water, no pulp, no sugar added) but when I tasted this, I was immediately hooked.  Because it's 100% coconut water, no sugar added and not from concentrate (tetra packs), it tastes so good.  I don't mind pulp, but I like the ease of not having to strain the water to give to my finicky toddler.  There is no pulp in this particular Zico Natural Coconut Water 6 pack.\n\nThe 2% does make a difference.  I didn't even know my old brand was not 100% until I tasted how good and better Zico was.  I then grabbed a container of my old brand and read the ingredients.  I was surprised that I was paying for 2% water in each container.\n\nI periodically buy coconuts from a local, natural food store so I am familiar with what virgin coconut water should taste like.  I appreciate that processing of Zico Natural flavor seems minimal.  It feels like it's hydrating the moment I swallow it, whether room temperature or cold, just like the coconuts I 'tap' myself.\n\nZico Natural flavor tastes so good, expensive though.  I search for sales at Amazon and my local grocery stores, then stock up!\n\nHope this helps.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nO.N.E. Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI love coconut water and have been drinking it regularly for at least 5 years but probably more.  Lately, I buy the near expiration date coconut water for the affordability and because with Zico, it still tastes good (so far).  I must say though, that my recent purchase of this O.N.E coconut water in the 11.2 oz aseptic containers tasted so bad that I had to force myself to drink it down.  The expiration is not until August, 2013, which is 2 months away.  Still, I had to mix one container of this with 2 11.2 OZ containers of sweetened coconut water just to get it palatable enough to get it down.  The Zico on the other hand, expires this month, but still tastes good.\n\nI will not order this particular O.N.E brand again, at least not close to expiration.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nLundberg Eco-Farmed Sweet Dreams Brown Rice Syrup - 21 Ounce - 1 Pack\nReview:\nNew to brown rice syrup.

It's richer and turns the tea cloudy, tastes and looks as if a splash of milk was added to the tea. NOW brand left the tea clear.\n\nI prefer the NOW brand in hot tea but prefer this for baking, cooking and as a topping (sweet potato, krispy treats, popcorn, greek yogurt, etc.)  It has a more complex and buttery background which is better suited to such applications.\n\nDELICIOUS.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I have this variety, which is a very, very good quality brand and I also have a shaker jar of fine grind for adding at the table. The salt really *is* black and as you take pinches of it from jar to sprinkle on the food, it will turn your fingers black as if you had handled charcoal. It is absolutely delicious on fish and seafood, and I never eat my salmon with anything but this Das Foods salt. Das Foods salts, all I have purchased, are all fine quality and this is one of the best lava salts I've had. In my opinion it provides a fresh, kind of \"oceany\" taste to the fish that is a great addition to the dish. I highly recommend this, especially if you love salmon like I do.

Oh. My. God!!!! This is the most delicious tea I have ever tried. I have a huge variety of teas from Amazon and am no stranger to many many varieties. I favor black teas always. But this Raspberry Oolong changed my \"black only\" daily drinking habit immediately. It is incredible! I used a tiny bit extra in my T-Sac DIY bag and that gave it more strength without bitterness.

This works wonderfully on all my others, Cranberry apple, cranberry hibiscus, blueberry aa and others. I did the double bag with this, expecting a good distinct flavor like the others give me for two bags. Nope. It was very watery and insipid. It had a vague lemon taste, but so weak and watered down.\n\n I was so excited to try this, I love a good lemon taste in anything. This was horribly disappointing and I have to say, my sister agrees. I gave her a box from my six pack. I will try three bags per cup and see how that is. I hope it will be much better, as I am stuck with five boxes of this tasteless lemon water.\n\nUpdate:  I tried to three-bag it in mug. I got much more lemon flavor, which would have been great had there not been a lot more mint flavor. I. Hate. Mint. Tea. Who does that? Mint and lemon?

I add my daily tablespoon in my morning coffee to sweeten and it is delicious!  I could probably eat the tablespoon just by licking the spoon but it is very sweet and I've been off white sugar long enough that too much sweet is a horrible taste to me.  This works perfectly.  I just use the stronger stuff for my baked beans - this is perfect for \"medicinal\" purposes!\n\nIf you need more iron, I'd recommend this.

I had no idea how these would taste, they're amazing!! They remind of a sauteed, sweet mushrooms, or purple potatoes or even baked yam. I eat them straight out of bag, they're terrific snacks w/ crackers. No complaints, hope Costco carries them for awhile.

These icy looking hard candies most definitely wrap up our Frozen theme. This huge bag is all I needed for the party. If you haven't had blue raspberry Jolly Ranchers they are a great hard candy that is colorful, flavorful, and has the perfect combination of sweet and tart. I'm assuming that most people have tried them, so Ill spend my time on reviewing the packaging. I absolutely love the size for a party.  I didn't count the candy, but the nutrition label says each serving is 3 pieces and it contains ~139 servings. That's over 400 pieces of candy; All in one bag! No need to buy or open multiple packages. It's perfect for my use (filling a pi&ntilde;ata) or would be great for Halloween. Each piece is individually wrapped.

Tastes incredible!\n\nWe have signed up for subscribe and save shipping and it ends up costing about half as much as if we purchased it at our local grocery store.

As others have mentioned in their reviews, the flavor is great and the ingredients/nutrition are better.  Hold on, though:  there's a \"but\" coming.\n\nRemember the flavored instant oatmeal we ate before we knew what \"organic\" or \"gluten\" meant?  Brightly colored \"banana\" bits held onto their fake yellow color and their cubic shape long after the hot water mushified the oats for us.  We ate fake crap, and we liked it.\n\nWe're older and wiser now, and want real bananas:  real bananas that we re-hydrate ourselves with our steaming hot filtered water for optimum health and enjoyment.\n\nExcept that rehydrated banana bits don't stay in bit form.  Nor do they rehydrate to sliced banana consistency.  Nay!  Rehydrated banana bits taste like delicious, wholesome bananas, and have the consistency of runny snot.\n\nThat's right:  runny snot.\n\nI love everything else about this oatmeal, but when I want to feel snot run down my throat, I'll go out and contract the common cold, thank you very much.\n\nBased on other reviews, this doesn't throw everyone.  Based on other reviews, you might love this oatmeal and shrug off the banana snot texture without a second thought.  But if you're a huge texture snob, I thought you might want to know what you're getting into.\n\nI will shudder and finish the rest of my banana oatmeal one snot-filled bowl at a time (unless I can't take it anymore, at which point the food bank gets a wholesome and delicious donation), but I won't purchase this again.  I think I'll slice bananas into gluten-free oatmeal the next time I feel a bananas-and-cream craving.\n\nBest of luck with your oatmeal experience, and thank you for pausing to read a different perspective.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nKaren's Naturals Organic Just Blueberries, 2 Ounce Pouch Organic All Natural Freeze-Dried Fruits &amp; Vegetables, No Additives or Preservatives, Non-GMO\nReview:\nHey, these are good!\n\nOk, I wasn't terribly surprised by how good these are:  I love freeze-dried fruit, I love blueberries, and I've never detected an \"off\" taste in Just Tomatoes products.  Some freeze-dried fruit smells and tastes like a factory for some reason, and seems to be a brand-specific problem.\n\nThese are nicely crunchy and nicely flavorful, but have a tamer flavor than some other dried food.  They taste a little cooked:  like homemade blueberry jam, actually, which is what I pretended I was eating.\n\nThere are only 2 servings in the nice big pouch, even though it felt more like 8.  I love that it's hard to over-indulge on these.\n\nThey stain my fingers!  I was surprised that berries without juice can do that, but these do!\n\nThey're a little smaller than Kix pieces.  I did get one bad or burnt one in the whole bag (I didn't spit it out to check, sorry!), but unless I find more in subsequent orders, I wouldn't worry about it too much.\n\nHope you enjoy these as much as I do!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBetter Oats mmmMuffins Old Fashion Instant Oatmeal, Blueberry Flavor, 5 Pouches per 7.55-oz. Box (Pack of 3 Boxes)\nReview:\nThis is delicious.  Steaming fresh blueberry muffins with that dipped-sugar crust top flavor with only 2 minutes of microwave time and no mixing?  Amazing.  Mine blew up in the microwave and the tiny office kitchen smelled like a whole rack of muffins baking even though there's no oven in there.\n\nOf course, the \"natural and artificial flavors\" help.\n\nI would ignore the artificial flavors and continue eating this convenient breakfast favorite if not for the my wheat-senses tingling.  I handle gluten better than most celiac sufferers, but this oatmeal really set me off.  Many of the other \"Better Oats\" deliberately have wheat in them.  This doesn't, but I suspect it has a fair bit by accident.  My condolences to other wheat-free folk, as this is quite possibly the most delicious oatmeal I've ever eaten.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBare Natural Apple Chips, Cinnamon, Gluten Free + Baked, Single Serve Bag - 1.7 Oz (10 Count)\nReview:\nWhen I had more time, I dehydrated apple chips and my coworker/friends gobbled them up and went looking for more.\n\nI have significantly less time now, and I'm trying to lay off eating sugary dried fruit all day, but I couldn't resist buying these with an Amazon coupon.\n\nApple Cinnamon flavor:  way better than some truly funky tasting freeze-dried fruit we've had lately.  Funky Monkey comes to mind, but it's unfair to pick them out because I can't remember the other one that was also so bad I threw it away without even offering it to the college students, who will eat practically everything.\n\nSea Salt Caramel:  The added caramel flavor is pretty subtle.  If you want to eat some caramels, you'll be disappointed.  That said?  These are pretty good!  The flavor isn't consistent, so you get the occasional Mmmmmmm piece in a sea of normal-tasting (and still delicious) apple chips.  I was going to avoid the extra sugar in these, but they're 46 grams of sugar to the plain one's 42 grams.  Not a huge difference, there.  They're also 200 calories/bag compared to 180 calories/bag for the plain ones.  If the sugar or calorie count is really important, however, you'll need to read your own bag.  These things change!\n\nThis has a *little* of that factory-floor taste, which I presume is nitrogen or another low-humidity, low-oxygen air replacement, and it dissipates pretty quickly.  I recommend letting it oxygenate for a minute or two before you dig in, as nitrogen is harmless but can taste really \"off\" to us.  (the same concept applies to letting a nitrogen-packed steak air in the fridge for 15-30 minutes before you cook it).  Of course, dried-to-a-crisp fruits will get soft and lose their crunch if you leave them out, so consider resealing the little bags in a sandwich bag or a small plastic container, squeezing out as much air as you can without crushing the chips.  I have now tried all flavors, and the Sea Salt Caramel is the only one that had any trace of this initial unpleasant flavor.\n\nChili Lime:  This stole the show at game night last night.  Everyone wanted to try it, even the paleo kids who usually eschew cane sugar.  The consensus:  \"Wow, that is really weird, and really GOOD!\"\n\nAdmittedly, I could taste the lime but not the cayenne.  I am on my own in this: the other gamers all tasted it and loved it.  I'm unlikely to buy these very often, but I'll have to try adding lime and cayenne to my homemade apple chips.\n\nFuji Apple Flavor:  Sweet, crunchy, good.  I reached for this for some sugar cravings, and I didn't regret it!  I love that the whole bag is <200 calories, so I can feel like I'm really cheating, but it's actually not a terrible health choice!  I expected Fuji Apple to be my least favorite flavor because it's the plainest and I usually prefer granny smith's tartness, but this was actually my favorite!\n\nGranny Smith:  I tried to save this for a friend's birthday because we both love Granny Smith the best in my homemade chips or when eating regular apples, but it was sitting on the table, and I caved.  It's good!  It's much less sour than I expected, and less sour than my own dehydrated granny smith apple chips, but it's still sweet and tasty, just not very sour.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNature's Path Organic Chewy Granola Bars, Sunny Hemp Plus, 7.4 Ounce Box (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI had to double-check the expiration date: Yep, expires a year from now. Still, it smells and tastes like oil gone bad. There's soy. There's flax. There's something sweet. But it's all drowned out by the taste and smell of the bad oil. I opened two bars to be sure, and passed one to my coworker to smell. \"Yeah, gross,\" she said. \"I usually eat stale stuff, but I wouldn't eat that!\"\n\nAlthough I purchased this exact product locally, I did not buy it from this retailer.\n\nI'm surprised and disappointed - their pumpkin granola cereal is my favorite cereal!\n\nI much prefer Cascadian Farm's crunchy pumpkin granola bars, but they're hard to find. Kashi's are good if you don't have a wheat or a gluten allergy.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy - Energizes and Supports Focus - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\nI don't react well to caffeine.

I don't know which herb is doing the job, but the overall affect is lovely.\n\nI still don't drink more than one - too much caffeine!  My box says it has 72 mg of caffeine compared to ~90 mg in coffee, but check your own box if it's important - these things can and do change!\n\nThe flavor is just fine.

WOW. They are crazy, crazy sweet and satisfied any candy craving I might have. They were so sweet that I was able to share my bag and nurse it through a day instead of gobbling it all down half-conscious of what I was eating. There was no subtlety, but I loved them. A++.\n\nThe mango OJ was also sweet, and tasty. It got stuck in my teeth every time: annoying, but not bad. I'd eat it again.\n\nThe bananas? Meh. Boring. They were the least sweet, the least flavorful, and the least interesting of the bunch. Some of the packages had a really yucky artificial taste to them, like a factory. It was bitter and unpleasant,and varied by package. I kept referring back to the packaging to see if there were unfamiliar ingredients (there weren't) or if it advertised being packed in a non-oxygen atmosphere that would have an off flavor to it. I tried airing them out, which didn't seem to help much.\n\nThe apples were ALL gross. Factory, factory, factory. Some of my coworkers shared my distaste, and some didn't seem to notice it at all, but every package was the same.\n\nIn the future, I'd order the pinepple guava, but no other flavor in this variety pack. Leave the factory IN the factory, please, and don't flavor my food with it!\n\nThe crunch was universally good for all of these products, by the by. It's very satisfying, but you can get it in any sufficiently dried food. All freeze-dried food and many bake-dried foods will have it.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I just love peanuts!!  We had a family cookout this weekend and I passed them around for each of us to try and the the overall vote was fantastic.  A great product from a great company.  I think the fact that the peanuts weren't ground up to small pieces added to the richess of the product.  The peanut size in the bars was half a peanut and there are loads of them.  Planters didn't use a pea shooter to put the best of their product together.  Some products will stress a certain item only to have very little in there.  Not so here.

They aren't bad but I could not taste any of the cinnamon flavor they are supposed to have.  The seaweed itself is backed with a thin layer of dried brown rice to help hold it together better.  You cannot taste the brown rice and as for the seaweed it tastes like a strong spinach.  That's the closest comparison I could come up with to try and give you an idea of the flavoring.  You can eat 1/2 the package of these and there is only 80 calories to it.  Nice light snack that doesn't taste too bad and will take the edge off of your hunger pangs.

It's really a pain having thought you took the wrapper off only to find that there were two on it.  No problem here with this.  Nice tasting chocolate and the size is just right for an after dinner piece of candy to go with your coffee or tea.

I then mixed well and poured it into a sterilized mason jar.\n\nI LOVE the smell of the Coconut manna, but then I love the smell of all coconut.  I normally use coconut oil in quite a few recipes and this is a slightly different experience as it includes the actual coconut.  The problem for me is that the ground whole coconut tastes and has the texture of....ground whole coconut.  Adding the coconut oil for creaminess isn't changing the gritty to smooth.  It changes the velvety texture of the oil to gritty, pasty (think really really thick peanut butter).\n\nThe only way I use it is making fresh peanut butter or almond butter in the VitaMix using just the nuts and a spoonful of Manna.  Said peanut butter on sandwich with banana or used in peanut butter cookies is borderline sinful.  This is the only thing I've found tastes good with this product.  I use coconut oil for everything else.\n\nI was adding it to various recipes but have found that the earthy/dirty (hard to describe) taste of the ground coconut just doesn't work with much.  In addition, it doesn't work well in smoothies in the vitamix as the manna never fully dissolves or incorporates in the drink.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSahale Snacks Cranberry Almond With Black Pepper &amp; Orange Zest Bar, No Artificial Flavors or Preservatives, 4 count\nReview:\nI have had hit and miss success trying sahale products, with my favorite being their snack blends.\nI love their creativity and inventiveness (which sometimes goes over into sheer weirdness).\nWe keep these type of bars around solely for emergency snacking and meal replacement (mostly in our cars) to keep us from snacking on even unhealthier items.\nThis variety pack was definitely filled with unusual flavor combinations. The bars are TINY, barely over an ounce (think snack candy bar size from hallowwen mixes for reference).\nThey average about 200 calories each, all have some type of nuts as first ingredient, have about 10 grams of sugars and 5 grams of protein.\nAll oh them were good, but none were great, and none will be reordered by either of us.\nOverall, we found them to be too chewy, gummy and sweet.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKember's Gluten Free Taco Seasoning, 4 oz.\nReview:\nWe eat a fair amount of taco seasoned meats in various menus so i was happy to see this gluten free blend\nIt arrived prompty and is packaged in a glass jar, excellent!\nThe flavor of the mix is excellent!\nThe price is way too high...it takes 1/4 cup mix per pound of meat, and the container appears to have about one cup of mix, maybe one and a quarter cup tops\nI would like to see this offered in a 16 ounce container at a much more attractiv price per ounce\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNurturMe Organic Quinoa Squares, Cheddar + Broccoli, 5 Pouches (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIn the good/better/best world of nutrition I think these snacks fall into the good category,\nIf your child won't eat whole foods and 'needs' their snacks delivered in mini-packages these are a good choice.\nEach package has about 8 smallish squares of snack, about 1/3 ounce of food.\nI am not a fan of mini packs of food because of the waste and receptiveness of package sizes.\nBut there are times where those little packages are handy.\nThe squares taste good, you can taste the cheese and broccoli which I like and there isn't any bitter/off taste that happens with a lot of self-labeled 'healthy' snacks. We all liked the texture of the squares as well.\nMy 2 year old grandson is a great and adventurous eater and likes real food so I wasn't surprised he liked these.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

She claims they even help her to breathe better but that point is debatable. At one time she had me believing that cough drops were good for her overall breathing but I came to find out that what she really likes is hard candy in any form or shape. I conducted a brief experiment with her: I bought her a large bag of regular candy, like 20 lbs of variety type candy, and stopped giving her cough drops. Well, it seems that what she mostly wanted was hard candy in her mouth and she never once asked me for the cough drops while she had this sizable bag available. At her age and according to her doctor she should get away with almost anything so I did not sweat the situation. Her dental work is, of course, expensive for she is addicted to sugar in the form of hard candy. Getting back on track: while she was enjoying YummyEarth Organic Candy Drops, Wild Peppermint, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4) she praised them daily. I liked the amount on each bag and the many kind and encouraging reviews I found prior to purchasing this item. 4 Stars and when the faithful bag of candy disappears in time record I will give her the last two, which I am sure she will go back to endorsing the healthy properties of this cough drop, wild peppermint and all!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nYumEarth Organic Pomegranate Hard Candy, 3.3 Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nDecent candy but a little steep priced. 3.5 Stars\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Kodiak Cakes All Natural Frontier Pancake, Flapjack and Waffle Mix, Original, 24 Ounce (Pack of 6) \nReview:\nI am just dreaming because I haven't been camping since my Army days, but this would be the perfect start of the morning with a strong brewed coffee and powder milk for the kiddies. I was really pleased with my first batch of Flapjacks (I had never heard of that term, or if I did it did not stick), and was able to enjoy them thoroughly. Or should I say we, for I refuse to eat alone if I can help it. I normally make my own batter, an old family recipe that requires accurate measurements, plus a few ingredients, and more steps than one. When I am patient and careful, they are very good indeed, but as of last my so called pancakes have taken a turn toward the mediocre kind, and when I came across this great product called Kodiak Cakes Frontier Flapjack & Waffle Mix, 24-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), I was very intrigued to say the least. So I purchased after reading the knowledgeable and glowing reviews by the well respected amazon reviewers, I never had seen so many enthusiastic reviews for Flapjacks (I love that name), and after reading the nutrition box to see how many carbs they were all about, I was gladly surprised and encouraged by the findings.\nBoxes arrived, cabin like, outdoor like packaging, so much in fact, I was thinking of a mini camping trip on the backyard to add to the overall effect, perhaps myself cheating a little bit and going to my King Size where I reach deep levels of sleep without a hitch, but making sure to be the first one up to start the Flapjacks. I almost felt like hiding the boxes, and pretending it was all my skillful ways that made it happen. Enough to say is that I was able to put out an outstanding short/large stack of double fluffy (these did not flatten at all, even left overs remain inflated the next day) Flapjacks. Everyone agreed I had taken the concept to a higher level, and for a minute or two I took all the credit, when a sneaky little spy discovered the boxes. Add great syrup, Smuckers Sugar Free for the sugar intolerant, and regular Maple or your preference for the rest, quality butter (worry about heart attacks a little later), and eat them while they are hot!\nThe real beauty is that for regular Flapjacks all that is required is plain clean water from the streams, or the refrigerator in our case, and follow closely the sound advice found in the their website, kind of like the big no no's of making flapjacks, one of the most important: do not over steer the batter, do not overcooked, do not flatten (leave them be!), etc. I wanted to take the credit, but really, it belongs to Kodiak Cakes Frontier Flapjack & Waffle Mix! Will do the Waffle mix, but for now I am lazy and happy to use be using plain old water like in the old frontier! 4.5 Stars!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAl Dente Carba-Nada Egg Fettuccine, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nStill debating whether Dream Fields Pasta is better than Al Dente Carba-Nada Egg Fettuccine, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6). I have tried their different kinds and I find them to be an acceptable option and to me much better than regular pasta.

I really did not know what to expect for a nutty flavor, but was pleasantly surprised. I plan to use them as a nut substitute when I make banana bread. I was concerned since we were having such warm weather this past week that they would turn rancid during shipping, but they arrived fully sealed, fresh tasting, and thus far I have no shell complaint.

These candies are delicious and if you can resist not eating at least half of one package as a single serving, you have more self control than I! Organic dark chocolate covered Brazil nuts are difficult to find at a reasonable price. Now I wish I had purchased more while they were on sale. The nuts are fresh tasting medium sized covered in a glossy dark chocolate. This chocolate does not readily melt on your fingers, such as non-glossy chocolate typically does.

The McCann's is cut larger so is a more chewier product. For those converting to steel cut oats, the finer cut of CC might make the transition easier. I could not tell a flavor difference between the two. Also for one serving I use one cup of boiling water w/ 1/3 cup of oatmeal. Here's my comparison based on Trader Joe's pricing:\nMcCann $4.99/28 oz., metal can, non-organic\nCountry Choice $2.99/30 oz., cardboard canister, organic\nSurprisingly the CC has 5G of protein vs. 4G for McCann and 4G of fiber vs. 3G for McCann based on  c. dry of each. Clearly CC is the best value, particularly since it is organic and made in the USA. BUT when Amazon has the coupon code deal, it's more of a coin toss and personal preference.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCountry Choice Organic Snacking Cookies, Iced Oatmeal, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIf these had not been organic I'd only given 2 stars. I'm used to eating Nature's Path organic ginger spice cookies which is the one I'm using to compare. The NP ones have a stronger ginger flavor which I prefer. The crunch factor (hardness) is about the same. The price point is the biggest factor. The NP at $32 w/o coupon for 12 9 ox. boxes are approx. 4.75 pound (the last case I bought had a coupon so were $22 or 3.26/lb). These are about 6.50/lb. at Amazon's current price. I probably won't buy these again as I'll stick w/ Nature's Path. That said, I did give this brand's chocolate mint cookies 5 stars and I do plan on purchasing those again as well as trying their chocolate chip and oatmeal cranberry.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nYS Organic Bee Farms - Organic Honey, 16 oz gel\nReview:\nThis is not your typical honey. Granted its organic and cream colored although it is not creamed honey. It is \"pure\" honey in the truest definition. The texture is solid, dense, somewhat waxy and velvety smooth with a pleasant floral taste. It describes itself as a gel, but I think it is much denser and although one gets a 1# jar, it is a small weighty jar. It softens easily on a piece of warm toast which is heavenly (no butter needed) or simply enjoy eating a spoonful by letting it melt in your mouth for a sensual treat. Due to its cost, which I think it is worth every cent, I won't be using it in tea. I'll continue using Rain Forest organic honey also sold on Amazon for that purpose. I think of this American/Canadian made honey as a true health food as it has numerous benefits. If you ever purchased the creamed South of France honey in the pail that Amazon used to carry, this honey's flavor and texture(when softened)will remind you of that incredible French honey. This is now my favorite honey. I encourage you to visit YS Organic Bee Farms website for additional information as they are a remarkable company. Also to comment on Swanson, the company that sold it, they were quick to fulfill and ship the order, both jars were well packed, they thanked me for my order a couple of times and sent a coupon for $5 off a future order which can be used in a direct order w/ them or on Amazon. So you know I'll be reordering this delightful honey and a few lucky friends may also receive a jar.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

The pyramid shaped flaky crystals can be sprinkled on for light as air like salt crunch or broken between the fingers as it gets sprinkled on anything and everything. Grilled veggies never had it so good. Salted Caramel is beyond luscious with this added in. I use this in place of most salt in my cooking even tough I have about ten vials of various salts ranging from Grey Hawaiian Lava, Pink Himalayan, Bamboo Jade, Hawaiian Red Alaea to a Black course grind  ( great with lemonade) on my counter, I cook a lot so I go a bit nuts with this stuff. This is worth the buck and lasts a while, I say try it once then see how you feel about it, I use this as my daily basic cooking salt but it's really so much more as the taste and texture surpasses anything else salt related that I have ever bought.\n\nI also buy their peppercorns which are really zesty and the gorgeous pinkish smoked salt, this is so good that it best my usual stand by, Kosher salt which is nice and delicate but doesn't have the crunch and flavor of Maldon.

I don't know anyone who can resist the cozy boxes with cheery, charming artwork pleasing to the eye, all printed on 100% recycled cardboard, with the tea bags being large and very plain as their taste once dropped in the hot water is worth the bag looking the way it does while the cover art on the box really make this a better tea than some of the brand out there in their fancy boxes and shiny labels, that taste flat and bitter.\n\nMadagascar Vanilla Red is a caffeine free blend of Rooibos, Natural French Vanilla Flavor and Vanilla bean. When sugar or honey or even milk are added it tastes like the sweetest, almost chewy vanilla one can sink their teeth into whenever a sweet craving kicks in. I swear it reminds me of the Madagascar Vanilla I use in all my baking for the intense and heady sweet aroma and it tastes like a bakery treaty in a cup and since it's healthy, easy to find and inexpensive it makes me a very satisfied customer. If I drink it plain, no sugar no nothing it tastes like a delicate exotic tea with a breath of sweetness, and this is one of the very few teas I can drink plain, quite a feat in my eyes.\n\nI heartily recommend it for any tea fan, even if they don't think that Herbal/Caffeine type teas are their cup of tea, haha, this is better because its not decaf, its naturally caffeine free, omitting the artificial process and it simply makes me happy when I drink it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDoctor Kracker Organic Crispbread, Seeded Spelt, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nMy first introduction to Doctor Kracker was through a random review on Amazon about eight years ago, dormant but not forgotten the review resurfaced when I finally saw a box of the flatbreads at my local Zabar's (perk of living in New York). While shopping I spotted them so of course my curiosity escalated and I took a box home, I love pumpkin and cheese, so these were totally up my alley, a few years later and I'm a still huge fan, in fact I'm munching on the now, watching Japanese Iron Chef on TV now, figuring I should review something that I'm so wild for.\n\nThese offer a major crunch, you almost have to chew these like a Viking with gusto but they are oh so good, the cheddar is quietly baked into to the batter with a few extra sprinkles on top and it provides a lightly salty and crispy background for the nutty pumpkin seeds which are sprinkled throughout each large slab, you can barely taste the cheese, just the salty residue really as these are nice and healthy, each packs 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per 100 calories ( 8 per box). This is a great treat to enjoy with beer if you want to go hang out with friends, or a nice piece under some creamy French Bree or nice slice of cured meat, even turkey and apples can become a lunch time snack with this flatbread under as it's sturdy enough to be a part of a meal. For me these make for a yummy bite, I can never get enough and I finish a box in no time, these are subtle but so refined that they beckon for me to keep coming back, anytime I'm at that store I have to get these because it's impossible to resists what awaits inside. These do not taste like junk food, they are very basic yet complex, at first they hardly taste like anything but the more you eat them the more you want, so keep some on hand once you start them.\n\n- Kasia S.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Natural Oven Roasted Almonds Vanilla Bean, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI have passed these in the store a few times before deciding to give them a try, and man I'm glad I did. The taste is really etheral, nothing artificial or fake, but a mellow, smooth buttery hint of vanilla - pretty subtle but addictive never the less. The first day I had this I ate about  of the container and had to stop myself from having any more.\n\nThese comes in a nice size, 8 oz plastic container, easy to take with me or keep on my desk at work, true that is distracts me, I find myself gazing at them and reaching to have a piece here and there, but they taste as good as candy and are healthy.\n\nWhat I also love is the lack of corn syrup, this is sweet but has none of the appalling chemicals that food companies love to feed us with. This little nut, native to Iran is virtually carb free and has lots of fiber, vitamin E and is rich in mono unsaturated fat ( the good one that helps lower LDL cholesterol). It is possible that almonds benefit the skin - good complexion never hurts, and help prevent cancer, have anti-inflammatory properties and boosts immunity - phew, so much for such a little nut.\n\nAlso this price can't be beat, I will order my next batch from Amazon.\n\n- Kasia S.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAhmad Tea Peach &amp; Passion Fruit Black Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIf you're going to sip this lusciously delicious tea you might as well grab your kitty or puppy, a good book, blanket and snuggle up in the favorite armchair because good times are ahead!\n\nHaving the pleasure of all ready trying out some of the Ahmad teas I was pretty sure this was a good purchase but it ended up being tasty beyond my predictions. This tea tastes like a wonderful black smooth tea with the succulent mouth watering flavors of juicy apricots. I prefer a black tea with fruit blend to herbal fruit teas when I want something soothing because the black tea give the fruit unparallel depth and character.\n\nThis really bursts with flavor when sugar is added and it can be drank day and night. I'm really looking forward to tasting other Ahmad flavors like Strawberry and passion fruit and maybe their Earl Gray. This is easily one of my favorite teas and I can't see anyone not loving it from the first sip!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAhmad Tea Peach &amp; Passion Fruit Black Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI'm a tea lover and as much as I like super fancy blends, sometimes plain black tea is the most  soothing and simply satisfying.  This tea is a simple and delicious treat with some smooth creamy vanilla and if anything its even more comforting and luxurious than any of my favorite black teas. The taste is so natural and subtly sweet that it feels extra special and can really be drank at any time of the day instead of plain tea.\n\nIm really looking forwards to trying all of the flavors Ahmad carries, and at these great prices I see no obstacles on my tea tasting journey!\n\nEach bag is packaged beautifully in foil and the box can stand straight up, facing forward with this removable slit at the bottom for easy dispensing.\n\nLovely and tasty, simply great tea.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nArrowhead Mills Organic Spelt Flour, 2 Pound (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI often use this organic flour to make warm and cozy muffins in the fall and winter seasons, my favorite are the Apple and Cinnamon Muffins from the Nigella Kitchen cookbook by my culinary muse Nigella Lawson.  Those are just divine and oh so easy, this wonderful organic flour lets me have fun in the kitchen because I can bake and try out new stuff and still make it healthy since the fiber in this product is impressive. Just  cup has 130 calories, 1 gram fat, 0 saturated, trans fat, cholesterol & sodium, 150 mg potassium, 25 g carb, 4 grams fiber, 0 sugar and 4 grams of protein with some niacin and riboflavin per serving.\n\nSpelt is special and it's related to wheat; the earliest findings of it are from the 5th millennium BC, just north of the Black Sea in Transcaucasia. Europe munched on it for ages, I come from Europe but it was America that introduced me to it through British recipes, life is funny indeed! This grain has been traced from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age, it kept the human machine alive and growing so I figure it won't hurt to bake with it once in a while, turns out that the nutty taste and hearty bite aren't so hard to convert to, this can make delicious  breads, cookies or muffins, white flour isn't the only option anymore, the world of good grains lies in front of everyone, just takes a change and courage to cook with the ancient grains that have stood the test of time, the taste and health benefits are worth the try.  Spelt does contain gluten, which I don't have a problem digesting, just a fyi to bakers out there who have food sensitivities and allergies.\n\n- Kasia S.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Its actually a variety of millet thats easy to grow in diverse climates and under unpromising conditions and has a sweet, molasses-like taste. Its also gluten-free. You need to read Nutrition Facts on this grain to see the shocking amount of minerals and vitamins that it contains. Rare grain but healthy and delicious. Takes long time to cook so I mix it with many other grains like amaranth and barley which take long time to cook as well and the result is one fulfilling, nutritious mix that I add to all my soups. It is a different grain but a rare grain and I consume with all oher grains. Teff is never organic, produced in US, gluten free with calcium and magnesium, Teff is kissing cousin of Amaranth. Both have almost the same composition, mostly the same minerals and vitamins except Teff is high in manganese. I stopped consuming oats since I could never find oats having any Phytosterols and hardly any other minerals, so amaranth offer more nutrients, especially when it is raw and uncooked. If I was baking bread, Amaranth bread would offer more starch 111-71=40gr which translates into more calories but for cardio, it is well needed. Starch makes you feel full just like rice, potato, pasta unlike greens where you can eat and eat and still feel hungry but with starch it is like eating protein. The 50% extra starch difference is what pushes Amaranth to sell more than Teff. Teff vs. Amaranth in calories 708/716, calcium DV% 35/31, magnesium DV% 89/120, potassium DV% 24/28, zinc DV% 47/37... Teff is never USDA organic certified. Amaranth offers more selenium 52-12=40% and vitamin B5 28-18=10% which are essential nutrients. All those measurements where for one cup serving.\n\nQuinoa is a milder taste grain in comparison to Amaranth or Teff but regardless I consume it all. Quinoa cooks in ten minutes, no more no less, ready on the spot, whenever I wish, with no hassle, with great taste but Amaranth and Teff take longer, and I mean really, really longer. Cooking Teff and Amaranth is a process, time consuming regardless of the brand but I ground amaranth for calcium and magnesium with flax and sesame seed and consume it daily.\n\nPowder will go rancid so need to purchase what is needed and kept in freezer.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Whole Grain Teff, 24-ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nTeff, a mainstay of diets in Ethiopia and popular in surrounding African countries as well, has the highest calcium content of any grain.

Produced naturally by the body in small amounts, melatonin plays a role in inducing sleepiness at night and wakefulness during the day. Although melatonin is marketed as a supplement to help people fall asleep, I'm not a big advocate of going that rout since I care less for unregulated supplement industry. Consuming natural melatonin from whole foods like cherries is clearly another story since it is a fruit and my body more likely is going to use that very natural ingredient from a fruit in a much different way than it would via a pill. I do the same with ACV since I have no intention to go to store every single day. I am very healthy with no chronic or health issues and for years I have consumed cherries for inflammation since being in many sports, my body appreciates any help that it can get for all those bends and twists that it requires my joints to keep up those grueling exercises at a time. I just consume a spoon every single night straight out of the bottle, no mixing, no stories. Conventional cherries are one of the dirty dozens so USDA organic option is better choice for me. Furthermore the added sugar and oil, make this a very high calorie food with thirty one grams of sugar for one third cup serving size.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBumble Bee Salmon Pink Canned, 14.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThe cannery which produces this pink salmon for Chicken of the Sea, produces for majority of the sellers selling pink salmon. All come from one area in Alaska. It is the same can with different wrapping and sold for twice the cost in supermarkets but at Whole Foods Stores for $3.29 and Trader Joes for $2.99 year round except three months out of the year. Will never taste the same as the sockeye salmon fresh out of water, not few weeks old that I BBQ with the skin and eat the whole thing with just pitta bread, nothing added just pure salmon skin, meat and juicy oils. That is one real tasty delicious food out of this world. These are not as tasty but it is the best alternative and a very good alternative since ready whenever I want it to, in a can. Forget about the farm raised junk fish where they add carpet die. For something like $3.50 a pound, this is a very healthy protein source for me with many nutrients especially after pumping iron. Costco sells the worst tasting canned pink salmon, these are much better than Costco. Pink salmon is sold in cans hardly ever or infact never fresh unless you catch it yourself in Alaska. These are all small salmons so you will get couple of whole salmons in a can with all the bones and the skin. Product feature description is wrong. You can not take out the skin and the bone that easily so you may forget about buying this salmon if you can not consume it all. There is no vitamin A in this salmon either like some claims out there. I consume a lot of wild fish, sprats, sardines, herrings... No farm raised fish for me or fresh fish unless I catch it myself since fresh fish means few weeks old except shell fish which I get it in three days. The smaller the fish the more nutrition in the fish. I consume these salmon since these salmon stay in the rivers of cold Pacific in order not to be consumed by the bigger fish and feast on small bugs and fish which are high in nutrients. Few of the reviews on Amazon about these salmons consuming squid is misrepresentation. Bones means calcium. Skin means good polyunsaturated fat. I mix the whole can with few different vegetables and wolla, get my calcium, protein and all nutrients for $3.50 a pound. These pink canned salmons are in water not vegetable oil. I drain the water since I could care less for 2000 mg of salt in the can. Healthy, without any additives, growth hormones, pesticides, antibiotics, carpet dye, or sitting on a shelf exposed to air for few weeks... Sockeye salmon is the only fresh wild salmon you can get during the spring run and sold as smoked salmon which I consume but cost more. Atlantic and steelheads are only farm raised. Keta, Pink, Chum, Coho are always canned. Bravo.\n\nWARNING: 99% of all cans are lined in plastic which leach high levels of a chemical called Bisphenol A, which has been linked to cancer, clogging of arteries, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA for more information. This product claims that it has no BPA. It is generally safer to eat fresh than it is to eat canned goods. Canned goods, sometimes are contaminated with harmful agents such as botulism.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nAhmad Tea Aromatic Earl Grey, 17.6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI consume few cups of tea on daily basis somewhere around 10 plus cups a day and I have been doing that for last few decades. I try all different brands all the time. I have bought this tea for $10 a can and that is from a busy tea shop that sells boxes after boxes. I use percolator and mix this tea with green tea and end up with an excellent tasting tea, cup after cup. This tea in no way is a full body Earl Grey tea. Ahmad Tea does not specify what kind of black tea. I would assume this is the same as less pricier English Breakfast Tea with added Bergamot flavouring. The real Earl Grey is sold in the green container which is pricier. After using this for one month, I stopped since for unknown reason this tea stained my teeth when infact I have not experienced such heavy staining with any other tea.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill French Green Lentils, 24-ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nFrench green lentils are not too popular and certainly expensive. I consumed this before I was able to get organic in bulk for $2.90 a pound. Takes longer to cook so better for soups. The taste is closer to green but for more money and available in organic form as well. Just because of the taste and the price, Bob will not sell it in four quantity bags like they do with red and green. Yellow is the most expensive, never in organic form, green and red always available in organic form. Red sells for 50% more than green. Green has more potassium than red and better for soups. This is conventional, not a GMO but certainly not organic. Excellent brand but organic is always better for the planet earth and its inhabitants if organic available. I consume red, yellow and last green lentils all the time. Red cooks fastest of all, tastes the best the same for yellows but yellows are rare. Green is firmer but not as tasty as red. Sometimes I consume lentils without adding anything to it but sometimes I do which tastes great. I do not soak lentils overnight just like I do with any type of bean since too much soaking will damage lentils but regardless soaking is a necessity since it allows heat faster without killing more nutrients. Lentils are soft unlike beans so just couple hours of soaking is good enough. Lentils need to be washed and rinsed few times since the dirt on the lentils causes foam regardless of the brand, organic or conventional, so rinse, rinse, rinse. I saut lots of fresh squash in EVOO with lots of spices, steam lentils in a separate pot, mix it together and place it all in a bowl where I add lots of fresh crushed bulbs of delicious CA garlic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/2-x-2-Pound-Fresh-Garlic-USA-California-Heirloom-Monviso-Gilroy-Finest-4-Pounds-Total/dp/B00E382P44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">2 x 2 Pound Fresh Garlic USA California Heirloom Monviso Gilroy Finest (4 Pounds Total)</a>&nbsp;which are real spicy and burns my tongue with lots of Sumac and my favorite sardines not sold at Amazon.

At $1.14 a pound it is one of the top daily ingredients of my diet. Difficult to find peanuts in shell, UNSALTED without any oil. Peanuts are very high in fatty acids where many other nuts lack and the price of peanuts are as great as their taste. No peanut butter for me since I consume the nut itself as medicine, a needed ingredient on a daily basis which is a priority to me for getting the fatty acids of ARACHIDONIC which converts LINOLENIC, MEAD for cartilage and ARACHIDIC an unsaturated fatty acid essential to the human body for healthy brain functioning and normal growth and development. I consume pistachios on daily basis as well for PALMITOLEIC fatty acid which increases insulin and almonds for PHYTOSTEROLS, VITAMIN E, CALCIUM and MAGNESIUM. I do extensive fatty acids blood tests which are expensive but it insures my healthy life style and peanuts are so important part of the equation. I could care less for sodium and processed peanuts since I have no assurance of what I get in processed peanuts regardless of powder, oil or butter at high prices and more importantly where nuts go rancid much quicker than when kept in a shell form. No sodium, without any oil is the way to go since roasted without shell are digested quicker which in return turn into unwanted calories where not roasted takes longer to digest which makes one stays full for a longer period of time. I bought PB2 at Costco and tried contacting the producer but they will not provide a table of their fatty acids or amino acids. In one word, this is a pure processed food with no table of what is in the mix. Even whey isolate powders provide a table of all their content when it comes to each acid but PB2 does not. It certainly provides the fact that ingredients are SUGAR and SALT with UNKNOWN fatty acid ratio of peanut proteins...

It has a mild flavor so I can use it for just about anything I make.  The quality has been consistent over the years.  The size of the can is small enough and I use enough of it (Mediterranean diet!) that I don't find it requires decanting as the can empties.  I have learned how to handle the spout without any problems.  It is easy to keep the container clean.  The can is cheerful with its bright colors.  The price is reasonable, especially since Amazon has it in its subscribe and save program--although the discount is less now for buyers than it was when I first started buying it from Amazon.  Nothing pretentious, just a really good and reliable olive oil.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCoffee Bean Direct Dark Sumatra Gayoland, Organic Fair Trade Whole Bean Coffee, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI've purchased this coffee before and was happy with how it worked in my personal blend of dark roast coffee--Sumatra, Italian Espresso, Columbian and French Roast.

The flavor is accurate.  One or two leaves is all that is needed in a broth.  Amazon packs these in threes so I think I have a supply that will last several years.  The price is reasonable.

I'm almost 50 now so my days of doing stupid stuff with hot sauce and peppers is over, but I can still handle a nice batch of inferno with a side of the runs now and then. I made a big batch of green chile stew with some leftover pulled pork I made and about 18 good sized roasted hatch peppers last Sunday. I decided to add one of these dried Scorpion Peppers to the stew for about 2 hours, at which point I fished out the pepper and tossed it in the garbage. I'l just say that it's a good thing we didn't have company for dinner. My wife can handle it but most people cannot. It was hot and it's the kind of hot that hits you immediately. No creeper with this one.....BAM!!!!! I personally love that and not many peppers can do that, they usually creep up on you. I cannot wait to try one of these in a wing sauce. I usually use Franks Red Hot, clarified butter, Dave's Original Insanity and a touch of honey or brown sugar for my wing sauce. I think I can omit the Daves Insanity next time and try one of these peppers. I'll probably reconstitute it in room temperature Franks for the entire day and then heat all the ingredients on the stovetop for a while. That should produce a wing with a good thwack of heat upon first biting in. You could also reconstitute these in olive oil to drizzle over potatoes or other veggies.\n\nI wouldn't suggest playing any jokes on anyone with these. That's not funny and you would really ruin someones day if they ate one of these.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTrinidad Moruga Scorpion Hot Sauce (5 ounce)\nReview:\nThis sauce has a nice flavor to it. At first it came across as being a bit salty but that was tasting it off a spoon. The only salt in the ingredients list is garlic salt and that's towards the bottom of the list. I'm not a total heat freak so this is about as hot as I can handle. It makes my head sweat and if I use too much of it my stomach is in bad shape as it cries out for me to stop. If you like this one try the Melinda's Naga Jolokia as well.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTrinidad Moruga Scorpion Hot Sauce (5 ounce)\nReview:\nThis is a flavorful hot sauce that has a good kick to it.  If you can handle a good amount of heat and flavor is a top priority then this is the sauce for you. It's not a concentrated sauce and doesn't use extract so it's not going to drop you to your knee's the way some of the reviewers would like. Ingredients are Trinidad Moruga Scorpion Chiles, vinegar, onion, tomatoes, lemon juice, garlic, salt, spices.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDave's Gourmet Naga Jholokia (Ghost Pepper) Hot Sauce, 5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI find this to be rather tasty for such a hot sauce.  It doesn't take much of this to make my head bead with sweat and its not foul tasting by any means. I'd like to incorporate this into a wing sauce. My go to is still Melinda's Naga Jolokia but this is good and I'm glad it's in the arsenal.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I will definitely be trying the rest of these.\n\nPrice is pretty good, you are paying right under 1.30 for a pack which is pretty decent.  It is delivered to your door for nothing with prime.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBarney Butter Almond Butter, Bare Smooth, 16 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nFirst of all, this tastes exactly like almonds without flavoring.  You can taste the almonds but it is a pretty bland taste.  You would need to add something if you wanted to get a stronger taste.  I am not saying this is bad, just be warned, you are going to get this explosion of flavor from this product.\n\nThe butter needs to be stirred if you want it to be smooth.  Once again, a spoon and a few moments and you have smooth almond butter.  It is a little on the dry side but once again, it is still a very good product.  Once it is stirred you can pretty much put it on anything.  It doesn't clump much and you don't really have to worry about ripping bread.  It should smooth over without any issues.\n\nMy only issue is the price point, you would do better buying the big jar, getting small Tupperware pieces and putting the almond butter in them.  It is a great product, that being said, getting a jar and separating it if you are on a budget makes more sense.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWildway Banana Nut Gluten-free, Paleo, Grain Free Granola, 6 Pack\nReview:\nAs many others have stated this is more of a chewy granola than a crunchy one.  It is pretty decent and I really like the coconut and cashew.taste.  The ingredients are easy to read and there is no sugar added.  This isn't to say there aren't any carbs.  There are nine grams of carbs of which five grams per serving are sugar.  You get four servings per container and the whole thing has 600 calories total.  This is a pretty decent snack.  You get a decent amount per serving at 1/4 cup and there is a good taste.\n\nAll in all this is a solid snack or whatever, I don't mind the lack of crunch and actually prefer this type of granola.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Chef's Naturals Walnut Halves &amp; Pieces, No Preservatives, Non-GMO, 16 oz\nReview:\nThese are excellent walnuts.

You can taste the cholate without if overwhelming the cherry.  My only issue is the chocolate might be a tad bit bitter.  If you don't like the taste of bitter chocolate you might not like this.  It is like eating a chocolate chip.  I don't mind the taste and am quite happy with how it tastes.\n\nThese are pretty good.

It has a smooth, rich taste and it quickly becomes very enjoyable. Even my three year old quite enjoys it.\n\nI am on a low carb high fat way of eating so this fits in. I searched the various chocolates and this came out best in that it doesn't use soy and also isn't processed in a way to reduce antioxidants. In fact it became one of the few choices on Amazon to meet those criteria and have a high cocoa percentage.\n\nGranted soy lecithin in small amounts is probably OK. But you don't have to worry about it with this bar and very satisfying taste. And 2.5 squares is a large serving, all my family usually has less than one square and it satisfies. Highly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBear Valley Pemmican Bars, Carob Cocoa, 3.75-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI bought these to be used essentially as breakfast. First off I find these delicious. They have almonds, raisins, sunflower seeds, and just enough of a cocoa taste. They are very dense and you will want to have a lot of water or other liquid available. They are also amazingly filling. Yes 440 calories (2 servings/ one par) so more of a meal replacement than a snack. But for breakfast a whole par gives you 16 grams of protein. Protein really helps get the mind/body going in the morning so they are excellent for that.\n\nBut you are also getting 24 grams of sugar. A little high. But at least it isn't from corn syrup or even sugar as a separate ingredient. I do highly recommend these for meal replacement, especially breakfast. I have them 3 times a week for breakfast and feel really good and satisfied until lunch. This is usually 4.5 hours away for me. I think they would be excellent for backpacking and camping as well.

The price isn't bad either and arrived rather quickly.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTEAMI 30-DAY DETOX TEA PACK: Teatox Kit with Skinny Loose Leaf Herbal Tea for Weight Loss and Colon Cleanse Tea Bags to Increase Energy\nReview:\nWell after looking at all the YT videos and Instagram accounts of fitness girls who rave about this stuff I bought my own kit. I just finished the tea yesterday but have some few packets of colon cleanse left to finish. In case you don't know the colon cleanse tea is only consumed every other day so it will outlast the Skinny tea during the 30 day treatment. I lost 5 pounds by the 3rd week but I haven't weighed myself since then. I know I've lost more than that due to how my clothes fit especially in my hip and thigh area. I was already fit prior but this really blasted the stubborn inches. As a rule, I don't believe that scales tell the true story more than pictures, mirrors and how clothes fit.\n\nBy the way, I must stress that I'm a 4-5  day  gym rat who also Crossfits but I do think tea is SUPER effective. Especially with bloating and removing toxins which is the culprit that causes the body to hold onto excess weight.\n\nPROS:\n-Both teas taste amazing (Very high quality leaves and herbal blends)\n-The aroma of both teas are great. Makes you feel so soothed as you consume them\n-The Skinny tea helps with appetite suppression. I didn't get any excess energy from it like other people\n-The directions are easy to follow and thus makes completing the detox effortless\n-It REALLY gets rid of any toxins or build up in the digestive tract (You will become insanely regular)\n\nCONS\n-The colon cleanse does cause some cramping. This is especially true during the first 2 weeks when it's seems like your body is getting adjusted to the detoxing ingredients. I have had the cramping reduce significantly now. The only time I will feel a cramp is if I don't go to the restroom when I get the urge. I know, TMI but I really want to state that may be the main cause of the cramping at times. You HAVE to go when you get the signal from your body. If you try to wait the cramps will increase in severity.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBewley's Dublin Morning Tea, 250 gram/8.8 ounce,80-Count\nReview:\nI bought this brand along with another brand of British tea.

One of the questions that the chefs were asked was \"What do you eat when no one is watching?\"  In other words, what is your guilty pleasure that might not jive with your being a renowned chef.  The answers were honest and amusing.  Although I am only a foodie and not a chef, if I were asked that question my answer would be \"Hormel Corned Beef Hash.\"\n\nFirst, let me be honest about what this is: this is not something that you would want to eat very often if you were worried about fat or sodium content; the potatoes are dehydrated; and the corned beef tastes a little like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/potted-meat/dp/B0025UCGKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">potted meat</a>.  Still, it is a real comfort food for me and I love it.\n\nI almost always add some freshly diced onions or shallots.  I also add either diced bell pepper or minced Serrano.  I put in it a hot skillet over medium heat and let it cook until crispy.  I flip it and while the other side is cooking I cook an egg or two in a separate skillet and place them, sunny side up, on top of the hash.  I like to finish it off with a generous dose of hot sauce.\n\nI buy this large size when I have guests (I have to admit that not all of my friends or family share my love for this product.)  I also purchase the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/15-Ounce/dp/B004S04X4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">15-Ounce</a>&nbsp;and also the 7.5 oz can when it's just for me (and when I'm not having it for my main meal.)  This is something that I always have on hand (I just hide it from my judgmental foodie friends.)  :-)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCoffee-mate 2Go Triple Strength Coffee Creamer, Extra Sweet and Creamy, 3 Ounce (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nI don't use creamer in my coffee or tea but many of my friends and customers do.  I offer hot beverages where I work and for both our customers and my co-workers.  I sometimes have real cream or a creamer on hand but it can go bad if I go a while before someone uses it all.  This small, compact creamer is great to keep on hand since it doesn't need refrigeration to stay good.\n\nI have to be honest and say that I don't like non-dairy creamers or even creamers in general but I can say that my friends, co-workers and customers seem to like this just fine.  It is very similar to what you get at a fast food restaurant in those little containers, only better.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nThai Kitchen Coconut Milk, 13.66 fl oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI have been using coconut milk for years, mostly for Thai dishes but also in place of milk or cream in recipes that call for those.  Coconut milk is usually thick and needs to be remove from the can with a spoon or a spatula.  For that reason I remove the whole lid with a can opener instead of piercing the top of the can and trying to pour it out.\n\nThis is great for making a delicious meal quickly.  I usually add a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/curry-paste/dp/B000QU3JM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">curry paste</a>&nbsp;as well as veggies and some sort of protein, such as chicken or shrimp.  The coconut milk gives the dish an authentic flavor and mellows the spice of the curry paste.\n\nThai Kitchens is one of the more expensive brands on the market but it is consistently the best that I have used.  I don't usually buy the organic version but I like this one as much as I do their non-organic product.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHomemade Dressing Mix Variety Pack (French Garden, Napa Garden &amp; Italian Garden), 3.3 to 4-Ounce Containers\nReview:\nWhen I first received my order of the Italian Dressing mix, I was a little wary. A lot of prepared herb and spice mixes on the market seem to be full chemicals that I can't pronounce and they taste very dull, extremely salty and have a strange, artificial after-taste. NOT THIS ONE!\n\nWhen my order arrived the first thing that I did was to taste the mixture straight out of the jar. I was surprised at how clean and fresh the taste was. I picked up on the herbs (I'm thinking oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary and maybe some mint), the sea salt and then the sweetness of the bell pepper combined with a tartness of the lemon juice. There was a slight bit of heat (the garlic?) and a nice, pure, food-like aftertaste.\n\nNext I mixed it with some fine olive oil and used it as a dip for some crusty Italian bread. Wonderful! Later in the week I used it, along with some Dijon Mustard, as a coating for a rack of lamb. I ended up adding a little crushed black pepper to the mix and it was great.\n\nFinally I used it as a salad dressing along with aged balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. It took a few minutes to get the proportions right, and I did add a little chopped rosemary and some fresh minced garlic. It was much better than any prepared dressing that comes in a bottle.\n\nI was really impressed with the flavor and quality of this prepared mix, so much so that I ordered this variety pack.  Here are my thoughts on the other two varieties that come with this set:\n\n*  French Garden\nAt first taste it seemed salter than the Italian version.  The chives not only tasted fresh but still retained their classic oval shape (meaning that they were not over-processed or ground to death).  The garlic and onions were strong, but not too.  I also picked up on the parsley and I thought I tasted a little tarragon.  I added this mix to a French style omelet (runny).  Very nice!  My fear of it being too salty was put to rest.  I next sprinkled it on some grilled eggplant and I was blown away!  It woke up the subtle flavors of the vegetable.  I will be trying this is other dishes to be sure.\n\n*  Napa Garden\nThis mix had a different texture than the others, probably due to the tomato powder which added a wonderful richness to the blend.  This one was not as salty as the other two.  The pepper gave it a little heat but I usually like more (which is easy to add, hard to take out). I tried this (along with some olive oil) with spinach angel-hair pasta.  That turn out to be a good choice.  The mix did not overwhelm the flavor of the pasta but added that extra kick.\n\nI highly recommend this variety pack.  All three will become staples in my spice cabinet.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRoland Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce, 7 Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nI love all things hot and Chipotle peppers are on the top of my list.  I usually buy pounds of dried Chipotles during the Hatch, New Mexico Chile Festival.  The heat of Chipotles are not overbearing (they are, after all, smoked Jalapenos) but the taste is warm and full of flavor.\n\nI had been buying the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/La-Costena-Chipotle-Adobo-Sauce/dp/B0011T8XGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">La Costena Chipotle Adobo Sauce</a>&nbsp;and liked them fine.  I recently tried the Roland brand and found them to be even better.

I must have seen them before but it wasn't until I had Tempura made table-side that I noticed their exceptional quality. Larger and yet somehow lighter than traditional, western style crumbs they give a pleasing crunchiness and toasty taste to shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, onion rings, and many other foods.\n\nI use this product both with and without Tempura batter. I really love Tempura shrimp and the addition of the Panko crumbs on top of the batter is not only authentic but it significantly adds to the taste of the finished dish. Unlike finer ground bread crumbs the larger sized Panko crumbs don't burn or blacken before the meat or vegetable is done. This is especially helpful when deep-frying larger pieces of food. It is also good on casseroles and certain other dishes that you would usually add regular crumbs to.\n\nI have purchased many different brands over the years. Since Panko crumbs are so much larger and fluffier that a brand like Progresso you usually need more than you might think. I go through an eight or twelve ounce package in just one meal. This larger size 24 ounce package is just the right size. One thing that I really like about this package is that it has a very creative opening an inch or two from the top and it closes with a zip-lock style device. This may seem like a small thing but it is really convenient and helpful, especially for a larger package like this one. That, combined with the quality of the Panko crumbs makes this an exceptional product.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDiedrich Coffee Variety Pack of Medium, Full and Dark Roasts K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 22-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nI have given over 10 Keurig coffee makers as gifts (I do have 6 children after all) and I usually include a couple of variety boxes of coffee with the brewer (a flavored variety and this one).  If the recipient of the Keurig doesn't drink this kind of coffee then they use it to serve to guests that do.\n\nOne thing to point out is that almost all Keurig coffee makers have the ability to make various sizes of cups (the B30 only makes one size).  Some give you two choices and some give you up to five.  Before you are talked out of buying these K-cups because a few other reviewers claim that this coffee isn't bold enough, I would wonder what size of cup they are making.  On my Keurig I can brew a cup as small as 4 oz. and I promise you that it is pretty strong with just about any of the bolder blends.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Coffee-People-Organic-Extra-Bold-K-Cups-for-Keurig-Brewers-Pack-of-50-Amazon-Frustration-Free-Packaging/dp/B002L444OQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Sometimes I use 3-4 ounces of it at a time, and it's tiresome grinding my own for that kind of quantity. So I went looking for pre-ground black pepper. I've tried at least a dozen brands, and I would say Watkins is right there at the top of the heap, one of the two or three best I've tried. The flavor is excellent and, while pre-ground pepper is not going to be quite as fresh as grinding it yourself, it seems to have come fresh and stayed fresh. The only thing I don't like about this product is that the tin, which is others quite attractive in a retro kind of way, but thin and flimsy; just the act of picking it up and setting it down on a counter can cause a small dent -- it's that thin! But I'm not docking it a star for that; it's just a container. The product itself -- the black pepper -- is extremely good and well worth the money.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKirkland Signature Fine Ground Black Pepper, 12.3 oz\nReview:\nI use a huuuuuuuuuuge amount of black pepper to make spice rubs and at the grill. This is one of the five I've purchased in the quest to find the perfect one. I do believe this one is best in class. The flavor is excellent, but what I really like about it is that it has a skooch less sting than some of the others - a tiny bit less heat/bitterness. Plus, the pricing is more attractive than some of the boutique brands. I unreservedly give this product 5 stars.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nOlde Thompson 9.75-Ounce Pepper Supreme Whole Peppercorns, Set Of 2\nReview:\nGreat pepper with a stronger, \"bite-ier\" taste than the generic black pepper which came in my grinder. Really happy with the smell and taste of this stuff. I will continue to use this going forward.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRetailSource Death Sauce with Chipotle and Skull Key Chain, Original, 5 oz.\nReview:\nThe flavor is excellent, probably in my Top 10 of hot sauces. Don't be fooled by the \"Death Sauce\" moniker. It's pretty mild. Even people unaccustomed to hot peppers will find this sauce \"medium hot\". True chili heads will find it very mild and more of a flavoring sauce than a hot sauce. Overall , it's a superb mild hot sauce with unparalleled flavor and I recommend it highly, unless you're seeking a truly hot hot sauce.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nThe Original Habanero Shaker - 100% Custom Flaked Hot Habanero Chile Peppers\nReview:\nWhen I received this product, I immediately got a take-out pizza so I could pour this stuff all over it. Fantastic!  I like hot foods and normal pepper flakes as served, for example, in a pizzaria don't even register as \"hot\" in my mouth. I long ago switched over to habs and bhuts to get my heat supply. Being very used to and accustomed to the mighty habanero (I've grown them for years, too) I can attest that this product uses very good quality habs. A teaspoon or two in a recipe works wonders, and it works equally well as a condiment. For chiliheads and others just kind of tired of the usual boring, low-heat flakes, this can really perk things up!  Highly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMexican SWP Decaf Organic Coffee, Whole Bean, Swiss Water Processed Decaf Coffee, Fresh Roasted Coffee LLC. (5 lb.)\nReview:\nI am big fan of this company's Ethiopian, so I thought I'd give the Mexican a shot.\n\nThe beans are very oily, literally shining with oil in the bag; I've never seen anything like it. I was wondering whether my burr grinder would get mucked up with all that oil, but it had no problem (though it did take a few more seconds than usual).\n\nThis coffee has an interesting and very different taste, very chocolaty. Kind of like a cafe mocha. I've never actually had a coffee that had such a pronounced chocolate taste before. It makes for a great iced coffee, because it almost tastes like a dessert drink. Hot, though ... I'm just not sure. I find it \"drinkable\" but nowhere near as good as the Ethiopian.\n\nI appreciate the fair and reasonable pricing from FRC LLC. Their 2-pound bags for $21-$26 just really work for me. I find that kind of price much more acceptable than the $16+ a pound seen elsewhere from so many sellers. I also really like the 2-pound bag format, versus 12 oz and 1 pound bags, which I go through in 4-5 days. These 2 pounders last me a couple of weeks.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nPeruvian Decaf Organic Fair Trade Coffee - SMBC, Whole Bean, Water Processed Decaf Coffee, Fresh Roasted Coffee LLC. (2 lb.)\nReview:\nI was very pleasantly surprised by this coffee! Having given up on caffeine for health reasons, I've been working my way through the Amazon decafs. A generally disappointing experience, though some are OK; the problem is that none of them really hit the sweet spot for me in terms of the right mix of flavor, fullness, roast, aroma, etc. So I've been in search of \"The One\" for quite a while -- an economical \"anchor\" coffee I can load up on in 5 lb bags while occasionally supplementing with a lb of more expensive beans -- and I'm thinking this is it.\n\nI've already gone through several pounds of FRC's Ethipian, Mexican and Columbian decafs. I like the taste of the Ethiopian but find it a bit too mild. The Columbian is OK but nothing special, there are better, though not at FRC's price point. The Mexican I didn't care for at all. In general I find FRC's decaf's \"good, but not great, at a very reasonable price\". This one, however, is at least bordering on great.\n\nThis coffee is bold and right on the cusp between medium and dark roast, not solidly in either camp - which is exactly how I like my coffee - a \"strong medium\" roast. I would agree with the vendor's take on the cupping notes: almond, sweet cream, hints of chocolate.\n\nThe beans are very oily, which unfortunately is not usually a sign of quality, but nevertheless, I quite like the flavor, aroma and aftertaste of this coffee. I will for sure be ordering more bags of this one..\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Unfortunately, the result was a bit underwhelming.  It wasn't terrible, but it lacked the punch I was expecting.  The \"spicy\" element was more of a subtle warmth than a real kick, and the peach flavor was more like a faint, generic sweetness.  I'm not sure if it was the blend or the brewing process, but it didn't quite hit the mark for me.  I'll probably stick to my usual herbal teas for a more satisfying experience. \nRating:\n", "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an Amazon customer that likes to write reviews for products.

There have been so many food fadsso many superfoods and garlic cures and the likethat I refuse to take any claims on face value.  Those claims come straight from the Marketing Department.\n\n As a sweetener, this Yacon Syrup is just like molasses. Its almost identical in consistency, and very similar in flavor.  There are slight differencesits a lighter, more subtle flavor than straight molasses. But that should give you a clue as to whether you will enjoy this or not. If you like molasses, youll like yacon syrup. I enjoyed it, and it was fun to try.\n\nAs a health supplementwell, I suppose it is up to you whether you will buy what the marketing department is selling or not. The fact that you cant use this for cooking severely limits its usefulness.  According to the manufacturer, you cant even put a spoonful into your coffee or tea without burning off its benefits. It is strictly served cold.\n\nFull disclosure: I received a sample for review.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nDeChunXian Yunnan Premium Pu-erh Puer Pu erh Dark Black Tea, Natural Organic Tea Leaves,produced From High Mountain Ancient Tree (Ripe Tea Brick)\nReview:\nMy confession:  I have always wanted to try authentic Pu-erh tea cakes, but I was intimidated by them. I had no idea what to buy, how to prepare them, what they would taste like  thanks to Dechunxian Yunnan Premium 250g Pu-erh I have finally gotten to try them, and I realize how foolish I was for waiting so long.\n\nThis is really good tea. In fact, it is so good that my wife simply refers to it as the good tea when requesting a cup. Its delicious.  Like almost all traditional Asian foods, it makes numerous, spurious health claims. None of which I actually believe. This probably isn't going to slim you down or cure what ails you, but it will result in an absolutely wonderful cup of tea.\n\nThe process of preparation does take some studying. Fortunately, there are numerous videos on the internet that will walk you through the process. It is nothing worse than Turkish coffee, which I also love and took some time to learn the proper preparation.  To do it right you will need a few accompanying items, although you will probably be able to improvise. I don't have every recommended cup and tea pot, but it comes out just fine.\n\nI love how many cups of tea you can get from a single brewing. Normally the tea gets weaker and weaker, but this sustains its flavor.  Ive tried both the ripe and raw varieties, and there is a noticeable difference. I liked the stronger, ripe version better myself. It really depends on how strong you like your tea.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStash Tea, Organic Premium Green Tea, 18 Count Box of Tea Bags Individually Wrapped in Foil (Pack of 6), Medium Caffiene Tea, Japanese Style Green Tea, Hot or Iced\nReview:\nLike many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.\n\nSo far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stash-Premium-Organic-Earl-Grey-Black-and-Green-Tea/dp/B000CQIDK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a>&nbsp;combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.\n\nThe flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are \"watered down\" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.\n\nBy no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTwinings of London Pure Camomile Herbal Tea Bags, 20 Count\nReview:\nTwining's can usually be counted on to put out a decent tea.  They aren't really top grade, but nor are they bottom shelf and make for a fine daily bag tea.\n\nHowever, I found their Green Tea to be a bit bland.  Indeed, it is the \"light flavour strength\", as it says on the box, but I wasn't prepared for just how light the flavor would be.  Supposedly, the tea used here is sencha, but I have had many, many cups of sencha and it generally has a bolder, grassier flavor.\n\nBecause the flavor is so light to begin with, you can't really pull more than one cup out of a bag either.  The next cup is just pretty much colored water, which is disappointing.  A nice strong tea usually yields a few cups, and that saves you some money in the long term.\n\nPeople who don't really enjoy the strong, grassy flavor of green tea might find this a nice balance.  It is easy to make, easy to drink and will probably suit many people.  I was looking for a decent bagged Green Tea to keep at work, but I think I will keep hunting as the flavor was too light for me.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nGood Earth Green Tea, Jasmine, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI got excited when I saw this in the tea collection at work.  Jasmine Green Tea?  I love Jasmine Green Tea!  So I had a cup ... and it was awful.  I thought maybe I somehow had a bad cup, so I tried a different tea bag ...  yuck.\n\nIt's hard to describe just how bad this tastes.  Imagine a cup of green tea that someone poured some jasmine-scented perfume into.  Or maybe dissolved some jasmine-flavored candy into.  I saw someone say it was Pez flavored, and I can agree with that. But no matter how you describe it, it is undrinkable.  Second cup was poured down the sink.\n\nAnd it isn't just the initial taste.  Somehow this coats your tongue and the badness sticks with you.  I suspect this box is going to be sitting around the office for a long, long time.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nONE ORGANIC Matcha Green Tea Powder (250g) - USDA Certified Organic\nReview:\nWe use this matcha green tea powder for pretty much everything other than making tea. My wife is Japanese, and likes making various matcha sweets--matcha cookies, matcha ice cream, matcha cheese cake, matcha muffins--pretty much every thing you can imagine. And while I am not Japanese, I love eating all the matcha creations she makes.\n\nWe go through a fair share of matcha, and were eager to try this \"One Organic Matcha green tea powder.\" This is culinary grade matcha, which is perfect for her purposes. It isn't that bright, vivid green of tea grade matcha, but doesn't cost as much either. And it comes in a nice big bag--we were both pleasantly surprised by the quantity.\n\nShe has baked up a few treats using this matcha, and is happy with the results. It gives a nice, strong matcha flavor. You don't need to add a lot to get the matcha taste, so I have a feeling this bag is going to go a long way.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nChoice Organic Teas Green Tea, Genmaicha, 16 Count, Pack of 6\nReview:\nI became a regular green tea drinker during the years I lived in Japan, and although I prefer loose-leaf tea I wanted some tea bags that I could drink at work.  Genmai tea is one of my favorites, and I tried this \"Choice Organic Genmai\" thinking it might be an affordable, convenient way to brew up some of that delicious roasted rice flavor.\n\nLike many, I found these tea bags to be drinkable but weak.  I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the loose-leaf tea I buy, but I also wasn't expecting it to be so watery.  You can get a decent cup of tea out of it if you make a small cup, but I really wish it was more robust.\n\nI will keep drinking my way through the box I bought, but I don't think I will go back for seconds.  There are probably better tea bag Genmais out there.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It tastes so much better compared to the non-organic stuff, I honestly cannot even drink the other stuff anymore. This has a much more real tea taste as it should. 100 tea bags will go a long way for just one person.\n\nYou should however be advised that this seems to have a lot of caffeine in it, unless you do a short brew. One cup is enough to get my heart going a little, so I only make small batches at a time.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice iced tea recipe then I have one I made just for you :)\n\nI spent a little over an hour perfecting this tea recipe to get an amazing iced tea each time. A lot of taste testing when into this tea to get it just right. The taste is not overpowering, but just enough where you can enjoy it as if you bought the perfect tea from the store. Makes one gallon.\n\nDo not drink this tea until it's completely cold or else when you add ice it will be all watered down and taste bad.\n\nThe sugar may need to be adjusted to your liking. In this tea you can just taste it. Feel free to add an extra half cup if you like it really sweet, but I find it's overpowering for a tea.\n\nWhat you will need:\n\nRoyal Tea Black Organic - Of course :)\n\nOrganic Meyer Lemon - Not as sour as regular lemons, has a more tropical taste too. These might be hard to find. Do not use pure lemon juice! You can check doortodoororganics.com if they deliver to your area.\n\nOrganic Sugar - Regular sugar may be used if preferred. You could also use raw organic honey, about 8 tablespoons. If you use honey make sure it's from Y.S. Eco Bee Farms. Honey must be added while the water is hot.\n\nFirst Step: Bring 1 gallon of filtered water to a medium boil, then remove from heat. Tap water can be used, but let sit uncovered for 24 hours before using because chlorine is added to town/city water. Boil the water for 10 minutes at a rolling boil after 24 hours to sterilize if you let sit out.\n\nSecond Step: With the water removed from the heat add 6 tea bags and let steep for 1 full hour. If you wish to have a more stronger brew use 8 tea bags. Make 3 semi-thin slices of lemon, remove seeds then squeeze into tea. After squeezing drop the slices into the tea and let the slices steep for half hour, then remove. You don't need to worry about removing all the lemon juice as it will be steeping. I find a quick squeeze works fine. It is important you remove the slices after half hour to prevent an overpowering lemon taste. Some pulp will be left behind, and that is OK.\n\nThird Step: After 1 whole hour remove the tea bags. Add 1 1/2 cups of sugar and stir. Let cool, then add to pitcher. Place into fridge. Serve over ice when completely cool.\n\nIf you've made this right you will have tea tasting as if it were made by a pro! :)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTwinings of London Pure Camomile Herbal Tea Bags, 20 Count\nReview:\nThank you, Critic-At-Large. You've saved me a bunch of money by switching to Twinings.\n\nI was also a on the go tea drinker, as much as three times a day everyday. It was not until I seen the top review that I decided to add up the cost of the tea I was buying from Dunkin Donuts. After going through hundreds of my purchases on my bank account (excluding cash purchases) it worked out to $1,532.16 in tea alone. Now if I included cash that amount would be even higher. Crazy.\n\nHere is a twist, Dunkin Donuts actually happens to use Orange Pekoe tea so it's very easy to recreate it. One tea bag for every 12oz of water and let steep for half an hour. Tasted the same if not better. Twinings has forever won me as a customer.\n\n10/10 would buy this amazing tea again.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nOrville Redenbacher's Ultimate Butter Popcorn, 3.29 Ounce Classic Bag, 6-Count, Pack of 6\nReview:\nGood popcorn that pops very well.

It didn't seem to be a problem with Prime shipping. Perhaps others used the slower shipping and it melted in transit? Either way, chocolate is something you don't want sitting in shipment for a long time. Use Prime's 2 day, or even next day it if you want.

The blend makes you experience mild sushi, minus fish & rice.... If you love wasabi and ginger you will admire an adore this new Lay's addition because you can't eat just one. I feel this is will become the #1 best selling flavor in the Lay's Potato Chip arsenal. 5Stars!\n\nNext flavor,  Cappuccino Flavor:\n\nNow this one is smoothly infectious with strong hints of Cinnamon and Spice. They're good but not great; and not addictive like Wasabi & Ginger. Out of the three, the Wasabi-&-Ginger are #1,  Bacon Mac and Cheese #2, Cappuccino flavor #3.

I am not denying that some people are sensitive to MSG, although it is much lower than initially thought during the 90's msg scare (much).  Most people are as tolerant to it as they are table salt, so like table salt, use it in moderation (unless you get headaches from it, a sign that you are intolerant and should avoid it).  I'm not an MSG lover or hater, I'm just noting that I am aware of the MSG in this product and for my own personal use, I am okay with it.\n\nSo please... let me just say that I like this product.  For a jarred instant soup type product, it really nails the flavor of tom yum.  I think it's great and a good price.  So if MSG is not for you, don't freak out and hate the product, or my review, just move on to something that fits your lifestyle.  If you think you'd be okay with that and want to try the product then go ahead and try it.  If you have any questions let me know how I can make this review more helpful and I'll give it a shot!

We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.\n\n I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost.\n\nUPDATE: Dr Pete is gross just like cherry cola. Here is a secert for all thoes who like cherry cola but hate Dr Pete like I do. Buy a bottle of DaVinci cherry syrup and add 1 oz. to a 1 liter bottle of Sodastream cola, you got cherry cola. Great part you can get diet cherry syrup to use with diet cola syrup, works the same.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCHIQUILIN Smoked Paprika, 75 GR\nReview:\nnot a big paprika eater so don't know how to judge this.

Overall it tasted ok but I had to use so much in my coffee to get a cacao flavor, I can't say I am that impressed. The color is also much lighter than the products I have used in the past.

I whipped out my trusty Braun bean grinder, opened the package and took a sniff. It smells great. We often use a French Press or the Keurig for coffee and this week I also tried a new k-cup so I figured I would brew this the same way. I really enjoyed the new Smooth k-cups and gave it 4 stars because they too had an unrealistic price tag. Reviewing needs to be based on the actual price of the item, not the discounted price for testing.\n\nI am giving this one 4 stars because to be honest, while it made a perfectly drinkable cup of coffee, it was no better than the coffee I already buy and pay a lot less for or the whole beans I buy at a local health food type box store for around $10, $6 on sale, per pound. It wasn't bitter but I also didn't find it to be tremendously smooth or bold above other coffees I have tried. It's a decent cup of coffee. No one disliked it but no one said it was the best coffee they had tried either.  For a $17.99 per pound Amazon Prime Price, I expected something better than what I can get for much less... I can get three pounds of great beans for this same price. I would give the coffee I already drink 4 stars and since this is the same, I can only give it four stars as well because I can't give it 3.5\n\nIf you have any questions pertaining to this product, feel free to post them.\nI will do my best to answer them in a timely manner.\n\nPlease note ****\n*** I was chosen to test this Amazon item and received it at a reduced price/free for product testing and providing my impartial opinion.\nI have left this review to assist other Amazon shoppers in making informed buying decisions, not to advertise for the seller.\nI received no other compensation for this product and have no personal relationship with the seller.\nI enjoy product reviewing but take product testing / reviewing seriously.

I've tried just about every coffee you could name, including coffees which I paid somewhere around a hundred dollars a pound; I can't remember exactly how much, but it was very close to that figure.\nIn order for me to get what I would call a great cup of coffee, I started roasting my own beans, in fact, I still have several pounds of green beans I purchased mostly at Sweet M.'s.\nI hand grind my beans using a conical burr grinder (zaussenhaus), which I find superior to any other way of grinding, (a close second, is mortar, and pestle grinding).\nI've tried every way possible, and I do mean that literally...every...way....you could name for coffee brewing, the best two methods for making a great cup of coffee are percolated, and vacuum.  I threw my French Press in the trash where it belongs, that method was the absolute worse way to brew coffee IMO, I didn't even want to give it to anyone, I tried that method for several Months just to be certain there could be no user error...but into the trash it went!\nMy Keurig, I did give that away as that was not as bad as the French Press, but still not for me.  I've brewed Greek, and Turkish using the Ibirk..etc. Automatic drip brewing is IMO for lazy people who are not that into having a great cup of coffee.  Again, without a doubt, (howbeit not well accepted by the parrots/sheep of the world)...is perked, and vacuum brewing methods.  One more brewing method that is not that bad, is pour over, but that would be my last resort brewing method.\n\nNow that I've somewhat set the stage, let me get to this coffee.  It is going to be hard pressed to find a better coffee than this. I will reserve this being the best until I try all of Pablo's Pride coffee's, (sans decaf).\nThis is a wonderful coffee, I don't think I could roast a better bean, so it looks as though my green beans will be relegated to becoming green bean extract, which is in, and of itself not a true relegation, but only as far as brewing coffee is concerned.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrench Market Coffee &amp; Chicory Decaffeinated, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nIt okay, I prefer plain coffee like Folger's Columbian.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nOberto All Natural BBQ Seasoned Pork Jerky, 3.25 Ounce Bag (Pack Of 4)\nReview:\nOnce this jerky is eaten I don't know how anyone can eat any other jerky.\nIt's like driving a Ferrari, and then comparing that to driving a Ford.\n\nSimply put, this jerky is absolutely the best.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nigourmet Parmigiano Reggiano 24 Month Top Grade - Pound Cut (15.5 ounce)\nReview:\nFirst of all let me state that the seller, (Mondo), was great to deal with. However, since this is a product review, let me review the cheese.\nI'm a 68 year old Italian that was raised in an Italian neighborhood. I went to Italian Deli's all my life, I must have eaten literally hundreds, nay, thousands of pounds of Parmigiano Reggiano in my life.\nThis is some of the worst P.R. I've ever had.....NO...this IS the worst I've ever had!!\n\nThere are practically none of the little white crystals I seek in a good P.R., I can actually COUNT the number of little crystals I see. (I actually counted 7 crystals in two pounds of cheese)!!\n\nI like the seller, not the cheese.  This has to be IMO, the lowest grade of P.R., and in fact, if it was not for seeing the stamp on the rind, (its not the stamp I like to see, but it is stamped), I would even question its authenticity.\nThis is not a good table cheese,(as far as P.R. goes),it is only (at BEST) barely good enough to be grated on macaroni.\n\nNow, I have to try and find some good Parmigiano Reggiano, as the store near me where I now live has closed.\n\nSorry, but I have to tell it like it is.\n\nIf I could, I would give this \"Parmigiano Reggiano cheese\" a zero star rating!  I feel as though I've simply thrown money away, as I won't eat this crap that is trying to disguise itself as Parmigiano Reggiano!\n\nLet me say this to its defense, as I really like this seller. The price for this cheese is amazing, even factoring in shipping, this price cannot be beat. I used to pay over $25.00 a pound for the good P.R., and that was years ago.\nI took a gamble, and lost. If you have not been spoiled by having real P.R. your entire life, then this cheese might be good for you, it is not for me.\n\nThe problem is that now I'm leery of buying any P.R. from Amazon. I may have to locate a shop in N.Y. that will ship.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Pizza Crust Mix, 16-ounces (Pack of4)\nReview:\nI very rarely give bad reviews, I'm very laid back, and always give the benefit of the doubt.

I will have to admit that the waffles I ate this morning were very good.  I followed the instructions on the back of the box but I was only able to make 4 -- 7 waffles.  My waffle maker does make large waffles so that really does not have anything to do with the mix.  I was a little worried when I had mixed everything up as instructed and the mix was a little runny.  But the waffles turned out GREAT.  The waffles had a very good taste and looked good on my plate.  I will definitely let my daughter now about the Simple Mills brand.  Knowing her, she is probably already using your products.  I did like the suggestions on the back of the box regarding adding pecans or fresh berries.  Always forget about those until its to late.  I had pecans in the house so i chopped a bunch of those up and added them to the batter.  Great suggestion.  This is a very good product.\nUPDATE...Yes my daughter already uses the Simple Mills pancake mix.  She eats everything gluten free due to help her gluten intolerance.\nShe has them at least once a week.  She told me that several times she will make her breakfast pancakes for dinner at night.  She has never had a problem with this product.  She says it is really good stuff.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nClamato Tomato Cocktail, 64  Fl. Oz\nReview:\nI have two  46 ounce bottles of V-8 Spicy Hot Juice in the frig right now so there will be some comparisons made between the Clamato and V-8 juices. I received one bottle of the Clamato under the Vine program. The Clamato is made up of 38% juice while the V-8 is 100%. Both are a cocktail. The Clamato has 60 calories per 8 ounces while the V-8 has 50 calories per 8 ounces. The V-8 has 650 mg sodium while Clamato has 790 mg sodium.\nThe taste of the juices are definitely among cocktail lines with the Clamato having a more thin liquid and watered down taste while the V-8  juice is thicker and heavier to the taste. If left in the frig for a few days both will need to be shaken before using as there seems to be a clear liquid that will appear on top of the liquid.\nThe taste for each is acceptable as a cocktail mixer and both have about the same kick when it comes to hotness. The Clamato contains MSG while I do not locate tat on the bottle of the V-8. I personally think either would be fine as a cocktail mixer and would result in about the same taste thus this becomes a personal preference for the buyer, however due to the thickness of the V-8 the Clamato might be more preferable when mixing with beer.  I will lean more to the V-8 juice since it is 100% juice, more favorable and thicker. I often drink it as a drink and not as a mixer.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nCafe Du Monde Coffee Chicory, 15 Ounce Ground\nReview:\nI used to travel to New Orleans just about every week and was always offered coffee with chickory. I got used to it after a few years and got to where regular coffee seemed weak. Then I quit traveling to New Orleans and started drinking coffee without chickory. I was just fine, until  few weeks ago we went to New Orleans and I stopped at the cafe Du Monde for coffee. Got back on the chickory \"kick\" once again and brought home a can of their chickory flavored coffee. We personally like he taste and my wife thinks it is too strong. It is very good coffee and if one is looking for an instant dramatic change to what they have been drinking they should sip on a few cups of this coffee.

My goodness, I bought a whole case of these seeing as I love Lo Mein.  Well, search further if you are looking for the real thing.  Here it appears like broken spaghetti, and the flavor packet obviously has a lot of bouillon in it, so you get broken spaghetti with salty chicken imitation flavoring.  How healthy, but then if you don't know what good Lo Mein is, and if you like spaghetti, you may be happy with it.  It isn't awful tasting but not that good tasting and definitely not the same texture as Lo Mein.  The box makes the noodles look bigger and they are actually somewhere between angel hair and regular spaghetti size.  It's just not what it says, and it is not good for you.  And, a lot of Asian food is rice noodles or something much more healthy.  Once this is cooked up it does finally make more than what it initially looks like (very little), but really not all that much.  Betty needs to remember that Asian meals are served with big helpings and this was probably a little less than the size of one real Asian dinner helping.  I was disappointed all around on this product.  Here's something odd, the picture of the product that goes with this review is in a totally different box than what I got.  The boxes I got are red and don't disclose it's Betty Crocker except a small spoon on one side.  It's almost an attempt to leave the name off.  Not the norm for this on, company.  Can't say I blame her for not advertising her name well on this one.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Shredded Coconut (Unsweetened), 24-ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is not your typical coconut.  It's rather dry, appears to be cut up into smaller pieces, a more beige color.  It's very different.  I put mine in the oven and the flavor came out more.  It's extremely messy since the pieces are small and it is not moist like regular coconut.  At any rate, I used it for a German chocolate cake.  It was good but just wasn't like the normal coconut.  I've found some coconut is too sweet.  This only has it's natural flavor.  I would buy the sweetened next time since not all brands are over-sweet.  Some would say this is way under-sweet.  It worked for me since I mixed it with ready made icing.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nKraft Fat Free Mayo, .16 oz. packet, Pack of 200\nReview:\nso glad I tried this, tastes amazing, especially on havarti OR swiss and smoked ham.

Get the Tetley with the English pricing on it to be sure.  Or from a vendor that is honest and states it is from England and if you buy in bulk/large amount (like here at 240ct) it only costs a little more that American grocery store tea and you are getting one of the best English teas on the market.

Given that we have a family member who requires a very low sodium diet, quick and easy breakfast options can be slim on our typically busy mornings.  And if I have time in the mornings, I would rather spend those minutes staring into a gigantic cup of steaming coffee than stirring a pulsating pot of steel cut or rolled oats. So, with great determination to overhaul our breakfast routine. Tipping towards ease of production and nutrition, I began my search for low sodium, high fiber, no added sugar, no or low sodium foods.\n\nLordy! What an experience in researching products that fit my criteria. And, it's amazing what manufacturers put in food to enhance flavor.\n\nI finally decided to try Nature's Path Organic Oatmeal Original Flavor. What really sealed the deal was the comment that one reviewer made, that his wife just poured boiling water over it and let it sit for five minutes. I ordered the oatmeal and have used boiling water each time and it turns out perfectly. The oatmeal is good. It has a slightly nutty, earthy flavor. The oats are rolled, so they hold their texture. I add about two tablespoons of golden raisins to the mixture before I pour boiling water on it, so that the raisins give the oatmeal the perfect level of sweetness needed without added sugar. All in all, I just like the wholeness and goodness of a purely unadulterated oat product like these for breakfast.\n\nNow . . .on Amazon's product page for this product there is a picture of the box this oatmeal comes in. On the front of the box,it says \"NO SUGAR OR SALT ADDED\". But, the Amazon description says that it has a sprinkling of flavor enhancing sea salt. So, I picked up the phone and called the company in Washington state. The company said the Amazon description is incorrect. There is no added salt. They have tried to get Amazon the change the description to no avail.  Also, the company is very nice to deal with and they appreciate consumer questions and feedback.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a sodium free oatmeal product, this product has no added salt.\n\nSo, overall, this is an excellent product. Healthy, easy to make, good flavor and quality. Responsive company.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nOcean Spray 100% Juice, Cranberry Pomegranate, 60 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nFrom Mrs L-\n\nThis juice is delicious. It is sweet, but if it is too sweet, it is just as delicious poured over ice with a spritz of icy cold water and a lemon wedge. The blackberry and blueberry taste are apparent in its flavor without having that after bite of bitterness that blackberries and blueberries can have. I have even frozen this juice in ice cube trays and popped the ice cubes in tall glasses and poured cold, unsweetened iced tea over them. Add a sprig of mint and no sugar is needed in your tea.  I also like to pour two cups of this juice in a blender. Add fresh fruit like peaches, pineapples, strawberries, a zing of lemon juice, a handful or two of ice cubes and whir around until it makes a slushy drink.\n\nI actually ordered this on a whim. We had been ordering and will continue to order the cranberry-cherry juice as it was a favorite, but we find that this is a new favorite too!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDoctor Kracker Organic Crispbread, Seeded Spelt, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nA note from Mrs. l-\n\nI think this is really my \"go to cracker\" when I am craving something delicious, crunchy and visually appealing to eat. These crackers look like something you might find in a great bakery or in a super cookbook like Moosewood genre. (Not that anyone could create something so crisp and delicious).  Some of the ingredients could have had the potential to overwhelm the tastebuds, but the recipe apparently developed into a subtle combination of flavors that led to something quite delicious. I especially like that the cheese flavor is a milder cheddar without a sharp bite and the organic pumpkin seeds are a sweet, nutty note. Pumpkin seeds that are not organic are often subtly bitter. These are happily not!\n\nWhile one might be happy to munch on just the cracker by itself, these flatbreads are delicious with egg salad, salmon spread, tuna salad, hot vidalia onion spread, curried chicken salad. A messy, but happy snack or lunch involves a light smear of mayo, a sprinkling of fresh basil, a thick slice  of tomato and a sprinkle of grated cheese. Broil until cheese is bubbly. Oh! My! The cracker really holds its weight with wetter foods like sliced veggies. A light spread of creamed cheese topped with a length-wise slice of cucumber and thinly sliced sweet onions is manageable for a delectable lunch without throwing crackers pieces from here to Mars.\n\nThe only problem I would note is that there are 150 mg of sodium in one piece.  And, I am not a fan of palm oil because its production can pose harmful effects on the environment. We just choose to eat few products with palm oil in it and this is one of the two products we consume with palm oil.\n\nAnyway, to conclude, a major favorite food item. Not just for snacking. Love a slice with a buttery poached egg. I have even run a package through the food processor to make great crumbs for breading fish or chicken strips to bake in the oven. Also as a cracker component for salmon cakes.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKirkland Signature Organic Strawberry Spread - 42 Oz (2lb), Made with Fresh Strawberries, 65% Fruit, Preserves, Jam\nReview:\nThis is the best strawberry jam ever!

We have enjoyed them plain as a snack, sprinkled on salads, blended with oil in the blender to make peanut butter.  They are sweet and flavorful.

It has a smooth, savory flavor that does not overwhelm one's salad. Rather it enhances the flavor of the salad. The cheeses are not strongly flavored. The vinegar is not strongly flavored. More of a subtle tang as to not overwhelm the creaminess of the dressing. The thing that I really loved about the flavor is that it did not leave that heavy, chemical aftertaste that some ranch or cheesy dressings can leave in your mouth. There is a delicious, savory aftertaste that does not linger on.\n\nI have made pasta salad with it. Yummo! I have used it as a dip with fresh vegetables.i used it with great success as a dressing for coleslaw.  I used it instead of mayo on a tomato sandwich.  I dunked a few roasted Brussel sprouts in it. Oh. My. Word. That was tasty. But, my favorite use has been on a chopped romaine salad with diced Roma tomatoes, finely chopped sweet onions, organic raisins, sliced dead ripe, but crisp Asian pears and chopped hazelnuts and pecans.  I could eat this salad every day. The dressing makes it a perfect flavor event!\n\nI was concerned that 2 tablespoons of the dressing contained 300 mg of sodium. That was excessive. But when I compared it to the Light version of this dressing there was 460 mg of sodium in the lighter version. So, I ordered the regular variety and try not to use as much.\n\nI will say that I think this is going to be one of my favorite dressings. It just has an appealing flavor. There is the sensation of 'satisfaction' for me after having eaten it that it was an enjoyable taste experience. So far, I haven't tired of it and thoroughly enjoy my daily salads with this dressing.\n\nOh, and I also,like it that the top on the bottle opens in a flip top through which you squeeze the dressing through a hole in the top. That makes it so much easier to put on a salad when it doesn't come out in a gigantic 'glop'.  The protective cover is very easy to remove off of new bottles.\n\nI have just thoroughly enjoyed this addition to my salad routine!\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Texture is nice, too. Not gritty like some cookies I've had in the past. I wish it was crispy like it says in the description. They were soft and crumbled. I could blame it on California weather but it wasn't that hot today (85 degrees maybe). Any way, the chocolate was completely melted and reformed.\nThe ginger cookie is not particularly strong in ginger or spice flavor. The cookie to chocolate ratio is chocolate heavy. What makes it so palatable is probably all the super sweet chocolate they use to cover up the slightly bland ginger cookie underneath. There are 8 cookies per box and four boxes per pack, if you buy them from Amazon. Tip for those who want to try these, order them on a chilly day or you'll get a box of crumbly goo like I did.\nI gave these three stars because I think they have the potential to be good.

They are intense and are a bit more bitter than sweet. Perfect for those who don't like their sweets too sweet. Perfect for those who want the intense chocolate flavor. Perfect for people like me with absolutely no self-control when it comes to chocolate. The sweet to bitter to chocolate ratio satisfies my cravings. But it's not too sweet to tempt me to eat more than one or two squares at a time. I find the 60% and 72% way too addicting!!! That is why I steer clear of those and only stock the 86% in my desk :)\n\nI also like that they are individually wrapped. Keeps the chocolate fresh. And keeps me from eating more than I should. When I buy chocolate bars, I find myself breaking off bits here and there and ultimately eating WAY too much.\n\nOne square is 60 calories. Only 3 Weight Watchers points. I'd much rather eat one square of this than the overpriced fake diet sweets that Weight Watchers sells. This is something delicious that I can splurge on that is also good for me, as I read that it is good to have 1 oz. of dark chocolate (70% cacao or higher) a day. Thank you to whomever did the research to justify that I can have chocolate every day!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNature's Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil- Pure, Cold-pressed, Organic, Non-GMO, Gluten-free- 16 Ounce\nReview:\nYou can eat it, cook with it, and put it on your body. I've tried eating it. It's like eating coconut flavored oil. Not too bad...I didn't stick to my regimen so didn't fully experience the health benefits but if you go online and read about it...there are supposed to be many.\n\nI cooked with it and it's a nice oil to cook with. But everything comes out slightly coconutty. Not a problem if you like that flavor, but it doesn't \"go\" with everything.\n\nI used to use it as a cuticle oil as well which worked wonderfully. I would apply to lips as a natural lip balm. Then when I licked it off, I felt it was natural and good for me.\n\nRecently my friends and I have been applying this to our infants skin to sooth and relieve eczema. We read somewhere that this would work but didn't believe it. But then we were desperate because we tried everything else. And this was AMAZING! cleared up baby eczema, so wholesome, gentle and hydrating. Baby smells and tastes great. Couldn't believe that this was the answer when nothing else worked!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nJolly Time Healthy Pop Kettle Corn - 94% Fat Free Weight Watchers Microwave Popcorn, 3-Count Boxes, 9 oz, (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI got this because of the reviews but let me just say that after having my first bag...this stuff is definitely overrated.\n\nI'm going to compare this with the Orville Redenbacher (OR) light/98% fat free kettle popcorn that I usually get. This pops great and has very few unpopped kernels, so in that aspect they're about even. But the taste is way different. The Jolly Time doesn't taste as good and it is way too salty for kettle corn flavor. It's like they took normal salted butter corn and sprinkled some splenda into it. Half way through, I was on salt overload. Texture wise, the Jolly Time is not as fluffly either. So there is less fluffy white and more hard bits.\n\nI'm sure if you have never eaten microwave popcorn before, then this would be quite acceptable. But in comparison to other brands, it lacks. This was definitely a disappointing purchase that I will have to slowly eat...for many many many months. Since there is a plethera of selection out there, I doubt I would buy Jolly Time again.\n\nAlso, it took Amazon 10 days from date of purchase to get it to my door. What is up with that?\n\nI think this product deserves 3 stars but I'm going to give it 2 because of the slow shipping and because the average rating should come down a bit. 4.5 stars is too misleading.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nOreo Mega Stuf Chocolate Sandwich Cookies, 13.2 Ounce\nReview:\nI thought I was in heaven when I ate the first cookie. So much sweet creamy center goodness. After three cookies, I was over the sweet creamy center goodness. I was on Oreo center overload. Plus I kept visualizing my arteries clogging up.\n\nI eventually ate the rest of the box...but I took out most of the centers and threw them away. I know that is wasteful but I just couldn't eat any more cream.\n\nI do personally know some people who really like these. And they say they prefer these un-dunked and the originals dunked. I guess all that extra cream makes it so you don't have to dunk it in a glass of milk.\n\nFor me, I'd say that if I was only going to eat one cookie and one cookie only, I would go for the mega stuff. If I wanted more than one cookie, then I prefer the cookie to cream ratio of the originals.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nWholesome Sweeteners Organic Fair Trade Honey, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nOrganic, fair-trade, delicious honey. According to the description, this honey comes from the jungles of South America. That might explain the flavor and the color of the honey. It is very dark, like the color of a dark ale. Much darker than the picture. The flavor is mild with a hint of tartness and no real identifiable notes of any particular flavor. So if you like clover, orange flower, or other specially flavored honeys, this is might not be for you.\n\nWhat I really like about this honey is the packaging. Particularly the spout. The opening where the honey squeezes out has a silicon nipple. When you stop squeezing the nipple cuts off the flow of honey. There are no drips. The bottle stays clean. You can actually store the bottle cap down without finding crusty dried build-up from slow leaks. A small little tweak to packaging makes such a big difference. So clean!!!\n\nLove the bottle. Satisfied with the honey. Would recommend to others.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKellogg's Special K Protein Meal Bars, Strawberry, 6 Count Box (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nI buy these as late afternoon snacks for my husband. He thinks they are delicious (5 stars). I don't eat them because I do not like the taste or texture (3 stars at best). Also 1 bar is 7 WW points or 170 calories for 12 grams of protein and 15 grams of sugar. Not worth it for me or my diet but you be the judge. I do like the price and like auto-delivery on Amazon. So I'll give these average of 4 stars...\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I also used buttermilk ignoring the new recipe instructions on the canister which differ from the original canister which specified buttermilk.\n\nI am going to have to dig out the powdered buttermilk from my stores because I strongly suspect that the disappointing difference from the original of a few years ago is a reduction in percentages of the other ingredients relative to the flour.  I suspect this because in the intervening years, I have followed the America Test Kitchen recipe which IS perfect but I wanted to get the Carbon premix for my mother who is very picky and liked the Carbon but not the homemade ATK version.  Sadly, this batch was a disappointment and now I am afraid to purchase the original version in case they have changed the percentages as well.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\n PG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 240-Count Box (Pack of 2) \nReview:\nExcellent.

It's missing the baking powder and coca powder ingredients from the Hershey's Best Brownies recipe.\n\nSaturated Fats\nAll fats are composed mainly of triglycerides. These, in turn, are composed of \"fatty acids.\" These fatty acids fall into three categories: saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. Of these three, saturated fatty acids are the main culprit in raising blood cholesterol.\n\nFoods high in saturated fat come from both animals and plants. Animal-based foods containing lots of saturated fat include butter, beef tallow, lard and poultry fat. Seafood contains a small amount. Plant-based oils containing saturated fat include coconut oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil and cocoa butter.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nPacific Foods Organic Spicy Black Bean Soup, 32-Ounce Cartons, 12-Pack\nReview:\nThis soup was kind of watery and I kept thinking it was waiting for something additional - maybe rice or corn or something.

I don't have a sweet tooth, so I like that the KIND granola bars aren't overly sweet. They're still loaded with sugars (cane sugar as second ingredient, tapioca syrup as third, some brown rice syrup towards the end), with 6g of added sugars for a 150 calories snack; I wish they would `tone` the sugar down. I also like the idea of multiple grains, but in the end the bar is mainly oats with some millet and amaranth... and the quinoa is listed after sea salt (so I assume is less than a pinch).\n\nGranola bars aren't a filling snack for me (I almost get a sugar rush and become more hungry in ~1 hour), these make no exception; but again, if I need the extra energy and sugar for a long hike, I'll take them with me.\n\nThe granola bars are somewhat chewy, but they still got some crunch and dryness (but they are not too dry). They make good on the go snacks, since they won't squish or crumble in a backpack or back; they aren't very sticky so you won't need to wipe your fingers after enjoying them.\n\n-> `Oats & Honey with Toasted Coconut` has a nice mild honey flavor and some coconut flakes inside; the coconut flavor was too mild to tell if the coconut was toasted.\n-> `Maple Pumpkin Seeds with Sea Salt` has whole roasted (yummy) pumpkin seeds inside and a nice mild maple flavor (and smell). The bar is quite sweet (but not in a sickening way), I didn't noticed any saltiness.\n-> `Double Dark Chocolate` contains a few nice tasting milky (not dark) chocolate chips, but it's not bursting with chocolate flavor. It barely tastes like single-chocolate, nothing double flavored, but still is a somewhat enjoyable bar.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKIND Bars, Dark Chocolate Nuts &amp; Sea Salt, Gluten Free, 1.4 Ounce Bars, 12 Count\nReview:\nI find it hard to 'commit' to a 12 single flavor of KIND bars, so I like this variety pack option which gives some variety. KIND bars are nice tasting, but not my go-to snack; the ingredients are great, simple, clean, but for me it's not a filling snack for the ~200 calories. I would like best to find the mini bar packs on Amazon at a decent price; I rarely even find them in physical stores.\nLike most nut bars the bars are sticky. I don't consider KIND bars good on the go bars; the honey and chocolate coatings melt easily.\nThe nuts in the bars are good quality and seem quite fresh, but don't pack tons of flavor. The bars I received in December 2017 expire in November 2018. With most nut bars the issue is that depending on expiration date and storing conditions prior to purchase, you can get hit or miss (e.g. stale tasting nut bars), no matter if you purchase from Amazon or the store.\nI like that they list the nuts in the order of predominance in the bar, so you can choose your favorite type of nuts.\nAll flavors in the variety pack tasted good. I enjoy they are not very sweet. The 'spices' (cinnamon, maple) are quite mild, would preferred a stronger flavor.\n\nThe box was delivered in decent condition, in a plastic bag; the box was slightly dented (since the bag probably didn't protect it from careless delivery), but the bars were in perfect shape.\n\nIndividual bar review:\nDark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt - This bar has a rich dark chocolate drizzle and bottom coating; I love it's not a sweet bar, so I can enjoy the dark chocolate and the delicious combination with sea salt. The peanuts are predominant in this bar as flavor, although almonds are listed first.\nDark Chocolate Cinnamon Pecan - This bar has a rich dark chocolate drizzle and bottom coating; I love it's not a sweet bar, so I can enjoy the dark chocolate. The cinnamon flavor is mild, barely noticeable. I liked that the pecan content is high, and I could taste them over the almonds and peanuts.\nMaple Glazed Pecan & Sea Salt - This is mostly an almonds bar, with some peanuts and pecans. Again, not very sweet, and the sea salt is nice addition to the flavor. The maple syrup flavor is mild.\n\nOther flavors I tried:\nKind Plus Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew - I really enjoyed the abundance of cherries and cashews, but I could also taste the raisins. The chocolate bottom melts very easily, this bar needs to be stored in a cool place; the chocolate is not the best tasting. I didn't like how sweet this bar is, the ingredient lists contains dry fruits, sugar, glucose syrup... more sweeteners than needed.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHEALTH WARRIOR Chia Bars, Acai Berry, Gluten Free, Vegan, 25g bars, 15 Count\nReview:\nThe Health Warrior Chia Bar is a chewy (but compact) and seedy bar; it's not sticky at all, so it's great on the go (although it might soften more on warmer climates). Since it contains chia seeds, it's has an odd texture to eat and will stick to teeth, but I personally enjoyed the bars nonetheless since I'm a chia fan; I mention this since some people might dislike this `seedy` texture.\nThe flavors are really nice, I find that Health Warrior overall has great tasting bars/snacks. Some varieties have a toned-down, mild flavor, but they're still enjoyable. Most `dark chocolate` based flavors actually taste like milk chocolate, they don't have the bitter richness of dark chocolate. I do find that same flavors tend to vary a lot in taste from bar to bar (even bars in the same box).\nAnother thing I like a lot is that the brand offers variety packs (Chocolate, Breakfast and Tropical variety) so one can't get bored with one flavor; still, I would love even more a variety pack with all flavors.\nThe bars are incredibly tiny; it can barely be a snack, I just can't see how people eat this as breakfast and stay full until lunch. The chia seeds will expand in the stomach so it's kind of filling, but even as a snack I need to have the bar with an apple or some carrots or celery sticks,\nFor a `healthy` snack bar this has an incredible amount of added sugars, from multiple sources (brown rices syrup - twice on the list, agave syrup). It might seem little at 4g of sugars per bar, but it's a tiny bar and it's just added sugar; it would have made more sense to use dates (or other dry fruits) if they wanted to add sweetness. The other ingredients are OK, pretty much natural and without any odd fillers.\n\nFlavors review:\n-> `Vanilla Almond`: I'm a fan of both vanilla and almond, and I found this bar great tasting. Most snack bars with `vanilla almond` flavor tend to have an artificial taste; not this one, the vanilla flavor was very enjoyable, almost natural. There were some bits of almonds inside, but very few.\n-> 'Dark Chocolate`: While the chocolate flavor was enjoyable, it leaned more towards milk chocolate than dark chocolate in my opinion. There are tiny chocolate chips inside. The cocoa liquor intensifies the flavor, giving it an unique touch.\n-> `Chocolate Peanut Butter`: The sample bar I tried of this flavor was an enjoyable treat, with dark chocolate chips inside and a hint of peanut butter; the chips have a surprisingly great quality dark chocolate taste, but I wished a little more peanut flavor. The bars that came in the `Chocolate Lovers` variety pack had a totally different taste, barely any peanut butter flavor, less chocolate chips and a mild vanilla almost coconut flavor.\n-> `Dark Chocolate Cherry`: With tiny bits of sour dried cherries and sweet chocolate chips (I simply don't feel any dark chocolate vibes, it's sweet milk chocolate to my taste buts), this variety is a nice treat. But I noticed the `flavorness` varying a lot between bars, from bursting with cherry flavor to simply tasting like the `Dark Chocolate` one. The ratio of chips and cherry pieces also varies a lot from bar to bar.\n-> `Caramel Sea Salt`: This bar tastes mostly like caramel, with the specific bitterness. It didn't have enough coconut flavor for my liking, but I loved the mix of sweet and salty (it's very well balanced).\n-> Coconut: This bar has a nice coconut flavor, but quite mild and with a hint of bitterness (not necessary in a bad way, but in a coconut extract way). There are some coconut flakes inside, which add up to the seedy texture of chia. It's one of the sweetest flavors, a little too sweet for my liking. But the bar smells wonderfully of coconut.\n-> `Mango`: This bar has quite a nice fruity mango flavor, not too artificial. There were quite a few dried mango pieces inside, making the bar even more enjoyable.\n-> `Apple Cinnamon`: This bar tastes just like applesauce mixed with cinnamon, a quite natural flavor, but also mild (it might be affected by the fact that the bar delivered by Amazon was passed the best by date).\n-> `Banana Nut`: This delicious bar taste exactly like a banana nut muffin, although I couldn't identify any dried banana pieces inside. But it was strangely very greasy compared to the other flavors.\n-> `Acai Berry`: There are more cranberries (actual dry bits in the bar) and strawberries (powder) in this bar than acai, but the berry flavor is very toned down, without the specific tartness.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nOrganic, Gluten Free Spicy Avocado Hummus, 8 oz\nReview:\nThis is a nice tasting hummus, but it's definitely too spicy and peppery for my taste. The texture is creamy, but you can feel the avocado pieces inside. Since it's so spicy, I could only eat it with crackers and bland wraps... for my taste it doesn't work in combination with raw veggies and deli meats.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNavitas Organics Cacao Nibs, 8 oz. Bag &mdash; Organic, Non-GMO, Fair Trade, Gluten-Free\nReview:\nAs a dark chocolate lover (I actually dislike milky sweet chocolate), these cacao nibs are a nice treat. The nibs feel like crunching something in between coffee beans and chocolate pieces. Since these are pure cacao beans, they have the winey fermented smell and taste that some might not enjoy; as another reviewer mentioned, these are an acquired taste.\nI add these nibs to my oatmeal or yogurt, and the thing I like is that they don't melt; so I can enjoy them whole even with my overnight oats. The nibs are too small for my licking in snacks.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nManitoba Harvest Hemp Hearts Raw Shelled Hemp Seeds, 2oz (Pack of 12); with 10g Protein &amp; Omegas per Serving, Non-GMO, Gluten Free\nReview:\nGreat quality hemp product, as everything I have tried from Manitoba Harvest! I love both the flavor and the texture. I add the raw shelled hemp seeds to salads, smoothies, oats, yogurt, baked products. It adds something special to muffins or bread while baking, I really recommend trying to add hemp to baking.\nNutritionally, they are a great way to add fats to my macros (better than chia in terms of fat vs. carbs).

Vanilla Peanut Powder, Non-GMO Project Verified, Gluten Free, Vegan, 6.5 oz Jar\nReview:\nI like peanut butter powder as it's so easy to add in baked goods, pancakes, waffles or oatmeal, or to mix with soy sauce for a `Thai` experience. I don't like opening and storing for months jar of peanut butter, I prefer for convenience the powdered form (which is also easier to portion control).\nThis Mighty Nut product yields a pretty nice `peanut butter` spread with water, good on toast or celery sticks. 2TBSP powder and 1TBSP water yields a more thick consistency, which I personally prefer. The peanut butter flavor is easily overpowered by other ingredients in oatmeal or baking goods. I also add it sometimes into yogurt, mixes well.\nBut by comparison, I prefer the PB2 flavor; it's more peanuty and stronger. Peanut butter powder is not as tasty as real peanut powder, either way.\n\nI tried both the `Original` and the `Vanilla` flavor, and I did find the `Vanilla` one to have a stronger/better peanut butter taste (while being a little more sweet). The vanilla flavor was there, but not very strong.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Also too many power outages up here (at least 30 years ago) to take a chance storing much in the refrigerator or freezer, we didn't have an automatic generator at that time.\nI remember one time my husband bringing home unexpected guests for cocktails and dinner, I always cook enough for an army so dinner wasn't the problem, but having a little nibble to give guest with a cocktail was harder.  But I got out the B&M Bread, I did not toast it, just sliced it thin and into quarters.  I popped a 8oz. block of cream cheese into the food processor along with a half package of dates and a couple tablespoons of Amaretto  and in a few seconds had a nice spread.

It has much to recommend it:  it heats well, has a pronounced tomato flavor, and, while fairly thick, is still easy to drink because it lacks bits of vegetable or pasta that might cling to the bottom of the cup.  My only real complaint with this flavor (besides the high sodium content, endemic to so many Campbell's soups) is that the \"dairy\" or cream notes are very slight.  This soup is about as thick as cream-of-tomato from the classic red-and-white steel can reconstituted with milk -- but it tastes much more like that same soup reconstituted with water only.

I really like it !!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKrusteaz Oat Bran Supreme Muffin Mix, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nWow Sun Maid -- you NEVER disappoint!!!\n\nI baked these muffins, even adding pineapple, as suggested on the side of the box -- the muffins (all 12 of them) came out of the oven as scrumptious, semi-moist morsels of perfection, right up to the slightly crispy but still juicy raisins on the tops of each muffin.\n\nThey stored well - I eventually put them (covered with foil) in the fridge, and now I am taking the remainder to work with me.\n\nYou only need one egg per mix, and some oil or butter, and liquid (in my case I used pineapple juice as liquid) -- it takes very little time to mix (I used a big big serving fork to mix up the batter with) and they pop into and out of the oven in no time.\n\nThe price is right and the result is delicious!!!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Chef's Naturals Slivered Almonds, No Preservatives, Non-GMO, 2 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nGood for baking, or eating out of hand.  What I like about Fisher is that the nuts are really fresh, these almonds are almost sweet -- they are moist and bake up very nicely -- sometimes I grind or crush them depending on what I'm making.\n\nI'm happy with them, and the price for these 12 bags is very reasonable.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSkippy Peanut Butter, Natural Creamy, 15-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nOops scuse me -- got peanut butter stuck on the roof of my mouth. Skippy - I LOOVE you!!!\n\nI've been consuming Skippy ever since I was a little tiny child who just BARELY knew how to slap peanut butter on a slice of bread and then slap jelly and another slice of bread over it and then head for school (Mom NEVER made our lunches). Truth be told, I once even slapped some sardines under the jelly -- I never did that again.\n\nI have seen MANY competitors come and go and even -- gasp!! -- tried some of those products, but always came back to the familiar taste and texture and comfort of Skippy -- whether Chunky or Smooth -- I LOOVE Skippy.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAmazon Brand - Happy Belly Italian Roast Decaf Organic Fairtrade Coffee, Dark Roast, Whole Bean, 12 ounce\nReview:\nWell, it is Very aromatic -- and when I brew it,  it is very smooth.\n\nThe beans themselves were quite aromatic -- I ground them for a drip filter. My other coffees are NOT as aromatic in bean or ground form, but seem to have more taste than Happy Belly.\n\nHowever, if you want a very smooth coffee with a very mild flavor, this is the one for you.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nGreen Giant Whole Spear Asparagus, 15 oz, 12 Pack\nReview:\nAnd although these do not taste as great as the fresh, they DO taste good -- and perhaps because they have been in liquid, in the can, they are softer and more of the stalk is edible (as contrasted with fresh-cooked, where the stalk usually gets tough once you get to the middle.)\n\nMy simple tastes require nothing more than mayo and lemon on these tasty bundles. I pour the liquid into a glass and add some lemon there too-- yum.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNewtons Fig Fruit Chewy Cookies - Snack Packs, 12 Count Box, 24 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nEither needs more filling or less cookie dough  -- as the dough overpowers the filling, and the dough can really be \"heavy\" on the stomach.\n\nAlthough all ls forgiven when these Newtons are crumbled a bit, put in a bowl and covered with a generous dollop of Vanilla ice cream.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

The other flavor options are Mango/Orange & Strawberry/Pineapple and both of those taste distinctly like mango and strawberry to me. This one is more of a generic berry mix with a slight tartness underneath.\n\nAll three of the flavors have whey protein (milk based) and are soy free, but these are pretty high in sugar for a \"healthy\" snack. I use one as a base in a smoothie, add fresh berries, cherries, some spinach and ice and blend. No need for anything else.

My one complaint is they are almost impossible to eat if they get cold - like chipping off pieces of an ice block with your teeth!

A little bit of health food disguised as a treat. I am a full on carnivore, but several of the Vega products are a part of my regular diet now and I pass them out to friends and family who are always amazed that a vegan item is not just edible, but good.

I don't know what I was expecting, but good chocolate was a surprise. The milk chocolate is really rich and very sweet - I actually think it's a bit sweeter than a traditional Hershey bar. I couldn't eat more than a little of this at a single sitting, it's just too rich for me.\n\n Each bar is divided into four \"bites\" so you can gauge the amount of caffeine you're ingesting. You will need a Ziploc bag to keep the rest of the bar fresh after you open it. The bites are thick and taste really good, it's definitely a milk chocolate candy bar. I ate one bite piece after lunch and it was enough. I noticed a bump in energy - the combination of sugar and caffeine will do that. I won't be eating any of this chocolate as an after dinner treat, no desire to stay up all night!

Fruit juice is still high in sugar, albeit \"natural\" sugar, which is still not a healthy choice.\n\nSince it is not just the flavor, but the fizziness she enjoys, we prefer this brand. It is just fruit juice and sparkling water, nothing else.

Add another if you want more intense flavor.\nI add a little plain cream to my coffee along with one of these for a creamier drink.\n\nThe pumpkin spice flavor can be used in other wintery drinks as well. It is delicious in cocoa and Italian sodas.\n\nBecause these are non-dairy, they need no refrigeration and they seem to last indefinitely.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

So i remember my grandma complaining that house blend coffee taste like water and asked me if I had Bustelo.  At the time I did not have any so i decided get some to give it a try.  Man this stuff is strong.  My grandma made expresso the old fashion way with a cloth strainer and wood handle, and my mom uses some stove top device. So if you like strong expresso, this will work.  I personally drink this like drip coffee (i am not an expresso fan).  If i really need to wake up I brew a cup or two of this in my coffee maker with a disposable filter.  There are times when I don't need as much caffiene so I use half bustelo and half some other coffee like Folders (my way off adding shots to regular coffee) .\n  If you are a casual coffee drinker or one who mainly drinks light brews/blondes this may be too strong for your taste buds, friends of my who drink basic light house blends don't like it.  On the other hand my friends who drink Medium roast and dark roast coffees like this brand.  and many even like the combo of adding some bustelo with another brand.  So this is a great tasting coffee if you like bold strong coffee or expresso.  Again I brew this like traditional coffee, when I need a lot of caffiene, i brew  this solely, on days when I need a little less coffee i mix it with a regular brand like foldgers.  And its a great price.  Starbucks was getting too expensive especially since I was drinking three to four ventis a day.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCoffee-Bitch-Slap-Extra Strong &amp; Extra Smooth High Caffeine Coffee 12 oz., Ground - Drip Grind\nReview:\nNot much to say other than it is very good, smooth and strong.

My mother, however LOVES it.  She has been drinking it daily for 8 days now.  While she enjoys the tea and the way it tastes (nice and sweet), she hasn't seen any weight loss benefit from it.  Granted, she doesn't really have much weight to lose but she was hoping for a pound or two.  She is going to continue to drink it because of the benefits it offers (managing blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure).  It steeps well.  She has been using my double walled infusing glass and usually lets it steep a little longer (usually about 3-5 minutes longer than the initial 8 minutes) because she likes it stronger.  It is good that you can re-use 1 tbsp up to 3 times because she drinks it before every meal (but with each use of the tea she has to steep it a little longer, obviously).

(Well not literally.  :)  ).  At first I didn't think they were bad, but wasn't overly impressed.  But after a bit I started to truly enjoy them, thus why I now give them a five star rating.  Due to their use of apple cider vinegar they do have a slightly sweet taste along with the garlic and dill, but not to the point of being nearly as sweet as a bread and butter.  I think if people don't get stuck in thinking they aren't like a kosher half sour pickle but are maybe in a category of their own, they will enjoy them as well.\n\nThey are pretty crisp as an aside also, and just slightly spicy.

Pandas are an endangered species!  The very idea that one would dice up a Panda and then use it as the meat in any meal is disgusting and unethical.  Yes, I know they claim this is sauce for Mongolian beef, but I'm sure that's to hide the fact that a panda is on the front of the label, thus clearly indicating that they expect people to use panda flesh!\n\nAs an aside, I have no problem with unusual or exotic meats in general, I'm far from a vegetarian.

I am only giving this product four stars since like \"Mntijo\" here with his review it was a bit greasy, and I also had stomach distress after eating it.  But this product is still delicious!

Hopefully I don't come off as a food snob of some sort when I say that, but for the price point and in general I do enjoy this product.\n\nThe four star rating is more for the following:\n\n1)  They are very greasy, and very slightly sticky also.  The grease is more on the outside of the meat stick then in the meat proper oddly enough.\n2)  Although to me it was obvious based on the photo of the product, the package isn't resealable.  Far from a deal breaker, but don't be out of storage bags or containers when one first opens this.\n3)  The meat could be packed just a bit denser in the casing.  Not by much, but it could be.\n\nIf they made them less greasy and/or a bit more dense I would have come closer to giving this five stars.

I picked this up at Walmart for $1.25. I prepared it on the stove and I was really annoyed to find out that the cheese packet powder is WHITE, and not ORANGE like they advertise on the box. I hate when the cheese is white, it looks so unappetizing. The taste isn't horrible but it's nothing special at all. My husband tried it and refused to take more than a bite, and he'll eat anything.

If I had read it at the store I wouldn't have bought it. Either way I popped some anyways. It's surprisingly good, it's not great though. It has more negatives than positives. The positives are that it has a sweet taste for sure, nothing chemical or weird though. That's about it for the positives. The negatives are that you need to eat a handful or the popcorn is bland, if you eat it in small handfuls THEN it tastes sugary and sweet. The popcorn is also cold, coming right out of the microwave, I think this is due to it not really having any coating like butter so it gets cold fast......I like warm popcorn. It's also really light and dry.......I like buttery popcorn. All in all this popcorn is good tasting and I am really picky about this stuff and artificial sweeteners, it doesn't taste fake or chemical to me. Have you ever had a popcorn ball? It tastes like a less sweet version. I happen to love popcorn balls, some people don't.\n\nUPDATE: I only ate 1 bag of this stuff. It's gross.

Is there a huge difference between the two- no! This orange pulp variety is a bit milder and if you have a delicate palette you might detect the orange versus carrot taste.\n\nAs I type this - I'm trying a taste of each side by side - undiluted.\n\nMake no mistake this woman knows how to make a good hot sauce! Fresh tasting, with a sense of \"purity\" is how I would describe her hot sauces. They are NOT overly complex - a nice bit of sweetness at first blush then just heat, lingering heat but no off tastes.\n\nI don't see how anyone could go wrong with any of her hot sauces even if they lack complexity.\n\nVery nice in a Bloody Mary!\n\nHow hot? About equal to Tabasco. Think of 3 or 4 tiny drops in a large Bloody Mary.\n\nWhy 3 Stars? I'm seeking perfection! BTW: I'd rate Tabasco's original at 1 star.\n\nElsewhere on the web this sauce goes for $3.99\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nDemitri's Bloody Mary Seasoning Classic Recipe, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nMild but well balanced. This is a concentrate (just add tomato juice and vodka).  It is mostly Worcestershire sauce balanced skillfully with chilies and a variety of other ingredients..\n\nIngredients/per label: Worcestershire Sauce (Vinegar, Molasses, Sugar, Anchovies, Water, Hydrolyzed Soy and Corn Protein, Onions, Tamarinds, Salt, Garlic, Cloves, Chile Peppers, Natural Flavorings, Shallots), Spices, Chile Pepper Puree, Prepared Horseradish (Grated Horseradish Roots, White Distilled Vinegar, Soybean Oil, Citric Acid, Sugar), Lemon Juice Concentrate, Red Pepper Sauce, Celery Seed, Natural Flavorings and Xanthan Gum.\n\nWant it hotter - add a drop or two of your favorite hot sauce.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nTabasco Original Sauce, Pepper, 12 Ounce\nReview:\nI've kept a bottle of Tabasco (the original blend) in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit. I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to \"kick up\" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.\n\nI'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.\n\nAfter taste testing over 40 different hot sauces (everyone needs a hobby), writing up notes, test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old notes versus new notes ----- I have to say Tabasco's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested blind.\n\nTabasco's original has only two tastes: hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.\n\nI could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm quite certain you will be pleasantly surprised.\n\n1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar with a hint of sugar and garlic. Top rated by many. Found in most supermarkets if you look. If you look carefully you'll see it in most pantries on cooking shows\n2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers. Found in most supermarkets, look for the wooden top.\n3) Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce (milder and with less vinegar)\n4) Huichol Hot Sauce (milder - less vinegar - not widely available)\n5) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar).Found in most supermarkets.\n\nI hope I've encouraged everyone to try a few other hot sauces beyond this one\n\nPS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost impossible to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a \"plus\" in my view but rather a \"minus\" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!\n\nWhat more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce after trying a few other brands.\n\nUPDATE ----- A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW of Hot Sauces has come out: While my original review was written over a year prior - just recently America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED a number of HOT SAUCES.\n\nWhat sauce came in FIRST? ------ Huy Fong Sriracha.\n\nWhat sauce came in very LAST? ---- Tabasco\n\nI'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.\n\nTastes vary and Tabasco will suit those who like a lot of vinegar in their hot sauce.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nFrank's Redhot Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce, Fat Free Hot Wing Sauce, 23 oz\nReview:\nThis is a mild hot sauce. That means you can apply it liberally and it's unlikely you will make any dish too hot. So it is user friendly.\n\nIngredients (as copied from the label): Aged cayenne peppers, distilled vinegar, water, salt - etc\n\nWhy 2 stars? This sauce lacks any character beyond a heavy dose of vinegar. If you happen to like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce - then you'll love this sauce and my 2 star rating is way off base. I don't like anywhere near this much vinegar. I've blind taste tested over 30 hot sauces and there are many better ones.\n\nWhat is interesting is that the original Tabasco sauce has a near identical taste to Franks once it is diluted.\n\nYou will find mention that this sauce was top rated by Cooks Illustrated. That is absolutely true but what these pundits fail to mention is this was a casual test, done in 2005, comparing only three hot sauces!\n\nSuggestion: Since tastes vary and if you happen to like this sauce - then buy it in one of its larger sizes - at least 23 oz and consider the gallon size. They cost little more than the smaller sizes.\n\nI'd encourage others to experiment with a sauce that is not so heavily laden with vinegar - you just might prefer any of these:\n\na) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined with a hint of garlic. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section! No vinegar.\n\nb) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section. It has a hint of vinegar.\n\nc) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Extra Hot Sauce - a great blend with more vinegar than the above but not too much. Another great blend.\n\nd) Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce - a decent blend but with a lot of vinegar. Still it is much better than Franks.\n\ne) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. A lot of vinegar but far less than Franks. Once again you will find this in your Mexican isle.\n\nIn my opinion, all of the above are far superior to Franks.\n\nIf you like Franks and are at the least bit curious, you should try any of these other hot sauces\n\nUPDATE (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen which is a TV program on PBS recently rated hot sauces. Tabasco came in last, Franks came in the middle and top rated was Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce\n\nPPS: Bon Appetit magazine recently rated Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce as \"ingredient of the year\"\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nTabasco Chipotle Pepper, 5 Ounce\nReview:\nThis is Tabasco's best tasting hot sauce! The Tabasco brand is traditionally associated with a very hot pepper (chile) sauce. This company has been branching out and now offers a number of new sauces. In my view, this is their very best sauce. In general, I'm not a fan of Tabasco products. Yet this one is excellent.\n\nThis sauce is based on the Chipotle - a smoke-dried jalapeno pepper.\n\nThe sauce is relatively mild (as is the chile) and it has the unique flavor, typical of this smoked pepper.\n\nI'd call this sauce almost sweet - much like semi-sweet dark chocolate BUT with the additional kick of some gentle heat.\n\nThe smoked taste of the Chipotle pepper is fairly unique. Keep in mind, if you like this sauce, you will probably be buying a bottle monthly - given its diluted nature. So if you are use to keeping a bottle of the traditional Tabasco hot sauce in your pantry for a year or more, it certainly won't happen with this variety.\n\nI've been taste tasting 7 other Chipotle hot sauces. This sauce is one of my favorites. The only real competitor is El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce. The Tabasco Chipotle has a bit more vinegar while the El Yucateco has some added sugar and tomato paste. Both are excellent.\n\nAs noted, this sauce is far more diluted than the traditional Tabasco hot sauce yet it is far more potent and richer tasting than many other Chipotle based sauces I've tried. At least, in this sauce the Chipotle flavor is concentrated and the added vinegar is not overpowering. Certainly this is the best tasting Tabasco hot sauce ever made and the only real competitor I can find is the El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce which has less vinegar and a bit more tomato taste. All the other Chipotle sauces I have taste tested are so diluted that they lack any real flavor and can be easily dis-qualified.\n\nTry a bottle - if you like the Chipotle pepper and I think you will - you'll love this sauce. You might also try the El Yucateco Chipotle which is also excellent yet a bit different. Beyond these two Chipotle based sauces I have not found any other Chipotle based sauces that come even close!\n\nHeads Up: You can probably find this sauce (in its smaller size) at any supermarket. I'm ordering a half gallon - on-line.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTabasco Chipotle Pepper, 5 Ounce\nReview:\nThis Chipotle Sauce offers some gentle heat along with the rich taste of a smoked Chipotle pepper. It makes a great Bloody/Virgin Mary and will add some interesting flavors to any dish that needs some heat. As another reviewer said -- this is probably the best tasting product within Tabasco's ever expanding lineup.\n\nI've taste tested 7 different Chipotle hot sauces and the Tabasco Chipotle is one of my favorites. The taste is very rich, smokey, semi-sweet and, for once, there is not too much vinegar! Yet make no mistake - there is a good dose of vinegar yet it is not over powering. It is quite simply one of the best Chipotle sauces I have taste tested.\n\nKeep in mind that this sauce is relatively mild when compared to the other Tabasco products.  In this particular sauce, the heat is far more subdued and not what I would have  expected from a Tabasco product. This sauce needs to viewed as a completely different product.  This is the best tasting Tabasco sauce I've ever tasted and beyond that -- near the best tasting Chipotle I have found.\n\nI paid $3.29 for it at my local supermarket. I doubt you'll have any trouble finding it locally and since tastes differ - I'd recommend you first buy a single bottle close to home. Then purchase a half gallon on-line.\n\nWhat sets this chipotle apart is the richness of its flavor. It is concentrated in the best possible sense. Rich, with some sweetness, smokey, some vinegar and a bit of gentle heat.\n\nI have repeatedly taste tested the following Chipotle:  Tabasco, La Victoria, El Pato, Cholula, Goya, Bufalo and El Yucateco.\n\nThe El Yucateco Chipotle is also superb and the only worthy competitor to this sauce. Both are rich - the Tabasco has more vinegar and the El Yucateco has a bit more sugar and a hint of tomato.\n\nUpdate: My favorite blend turns out to be tomato juice, a fairly heavy dose of Tabasco Chipotle plus a bit of Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. I also add a dash of Worchester sauce and lemon juice.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTuong Ot Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce 28oz\nReview:\nThis hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a cayenne pepper delivery device. A few drops add a lot of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.\n\nWhile Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a vinegar note - this product has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle sweetness with garlic notes to this sauce. While Tabasco can taste harsh if you add enough to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.\n\nI wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato is simply the sun ripened chilies and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste\n\nI like this product and I'd recommend its purchase but I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem, in any way, exceptional. There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic sure beats the vinegar aftertaste evidenced in Tabasco.\n\nFor the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to have it on hand.\n\nAs another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably only want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.\n\nUpdate (July 2010) - a formal taste test\n\nI put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too \"hot\" to taste\n\nResults: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh but sweeter note\n\nUpdate (August 2013): While my review was written some time ago - just recently (August, 2013) America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS tested a wide number of hot sauces. What sauce came in last? Tabasco! First was the Huy Fong Sriracha.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

To make microwave cocoa with it, one cup at a time, put a few teaspoons in the bottom of a cup, with a little cold water, and make a paste. (This mixes it without melting the cocoa, which is why microwave cocoa usually doesn't work.)  Pour regular or almond milk into the cup, once you have made your paste,  and microwave the cup on high for 1 1/2 minutes.  The result is a steaming, sweet, coffeeshop appropriate cocoa.\n\nThis is also truly gluten-free. I'm a celiac with a sixteen-year-old diagnosis, and this doesn't make me sick  at all.  The only downside to this is that the bag is huge, and it gets cocoa everywhere. If you don't want cocoa all over your arms or sleeves, you'll have to have another dispenser to put the cocoa in.  Highly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEner-G Foods, Tapioca Flour, Wheat Free, Gluten Free, 16 oz\nReview:\nYou can't make gluten-free cupcakes, doughnuts or beignets without this:  you need it for \"loft\".

Kraft Grated Parmesan cheese has been around since 1945.  The container has been updated, but the cheese is still the queen.  There are more delicious variations, such as freshly grated . . . and now Kraft has a kind with the grater included so we can  grate our cheese to serve it fresh.  I still buy large amounts of the good basic grated parmesan in the refillable green shaker container. It is quick, and most people are in a hurry these days.  It will keep if we leave it on the table when we eat at the cafeteria.  Ususally at home, I keep it in the refrigerator.\n\nIt is great for a wide range of dishes, including pastas, soups, sauce, snack, bread, and meat. With only ten calories per teaspoon, we can sprinkle on all we want without feeling guilty.  The cheese taste is one I crave, and eating Kraft's Parmesan is a good way to satisfy that craving for cheese.\n\n Perhaps parmesan cheese has been around since the eighth century B. C. or was it developed about 400 years ago in in the Italian city of Parma?  There was a story that near Parma there was a mountain made entirely of parmesan cheese.  On top of the mountain a community of macaroini makers cooked hot pasta, bathed it in butter, and rolled it down the mountain to the hungry people below. There is a legend that it was used by Roman legionniares becaue it lasted throughout their long journeys.  (I found these stories on Kraft websites, and I could not resist sharing them with you.)\n\nSome of our recipes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Flavored-with-Love-Mary-Lou-s-Family-and-Friends-Can-Cook/dp/0974191221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Collard-Patch/dp/097419123X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Collard Patch</a>&nbsp;call for large amounts of Kraft Parmesan.

My friend and I are spicemouths, and we found the mixers decently flavored, perhaps better than some dishes we've tried in Italian restaurants that needed to fire their cooks.  We eat in many different restaurants throughout the United States to evaluate the food.  What we have discovered is that mediocre food can be made tasty if we apply our emergency taste-enhancer kit.  Actually this dish was better than mediocre; in fact it was tasty, especially after we added some items from the kit. (We keep an array of items in our glove compartments of our vehicles and on our breakfast bar.) Realizing that we did not want to alter the calorie-count too much, we added a tiny shake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kraft-Grated-Parmesan-Cheese-4-5-lb-container/dp/B001C5Z23M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese - 4.5 lb. container</a>, which was about 10 calories.  When we eat pasta, we like a little cheese. Then, being the way we are -- Louisiana and Texas people -- we needed a little kick.  We shook on a few flakes of crushed red.

That's all we added, although we do have other items in our emergency supplies.  With those two little items, the ziti and meat sauce tasted good.\n\nPreparing it was fun.  The cute little container with the strainer lid amused me.  I thought I would wash it and reuse it, but I was amazed to discover it was engineered for single use.\n\nThis meal of 340 calories was satisfying and handled our hunger efficiently.  It contains 600 mg sodium, which is perhaps a little less than some prepared dishes.  I was surprised to see that it contains 990 mg potassium.  People with renal disease should probably avoid this product unless they have the approval of their physician or registered dietician. There are 6 grams of total fat and 56 carb grams. With 8 grams of dietary fiber, it should get an approving nod from Weight Watchers. It meets the criteria established by the American Heart Association.\n\nI would recommend this dish for anyone who needs to take lunch to work where there is no refrigerator but where there is a microwave oven.  I thought we would eat it again soon, but weeks have passed and we are still thinking about it.\n\nMostly recommended.\n\nMary Lou Cheatham, co-author of THE COLLARD PATCH/\nAuthor of FLAVORED WITH LOVE, SOLOMON'S PORCH,\nDO YOU KNOW HOW GOD LOVES YOU?\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSun Maid California Raisins, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nWe like raisins (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sun-Maid-Raisins-12-Ounce-Bags-Pack-of-6/dp/B000IZQMRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sun Maid Raisins, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>), and if you knew how many we eat, you would be shocked.

Raisns have 130 calories in a 1/4 cup serving.  There are condensed food.  They contain no fat. They have natural sugar with a large carbohydrate load.  One serving has almost no sodium but 310 mg potassium.  Diabetics and renal patients should consult with their dieticians before including raisins in their diets.\n\nI hope you enjoy Ruth's recipe and find this review helpful.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S Baking Cocoa, SPECIAL DARK Hot Cocoa, 8 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis box of the most magnificent flavor in the world -- Hershey's Cocoa (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hershey-s-Cocoa-Natural-Unsweetened-8-Ounce-Can-Pack-of-6/dp/B000IZSN1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hershey's Cocoa, Natural Unsweetened, 8-Ounce Can (Pack of 6)</a>)-- contains the secret of my favorite childhood food memories.  My mother could take a box of Hershey's Cocoa and produce a wonderland of culinary treasures.  My brother and I convinced her that we could not drink milk unless it was hot cocoa.

It was a liquid meal sold as a diet aid.  Four cans a day @ 225 calories a can was supposed to be a full day's nutrition.  Metrecal was the first thing I thought of when I tasted Boost 100.  So I got curious and went to look up Metrecal which has been off the market since the mid-70s.  From what I can gather the ingredients are roughly the same, skim milk powder, soy protein, oil, vitamins and minerals.  Since both Boost and Metrecal have their roots in nutritional supplements for people who can't have a solid diet for whatever reason, it stands to reason that if it worked then, it's still going to work.  And in fact that combination delivers a solid 10 grams of protein in each bottle, plus vitamins, minerals, some carbs and fats.  It's a solid nutritional supplement with the added benefit of being low in calories\n\nNow if you look up Metrecal online you'll see all sorts of hand-waving about how awful it tasted.  While I think that's mostly hyperbole from people who probably never even tasted the stuff,  I'm not going to try to tell you it was the best thing since Cherry Garcia ice cream.  It wasn't and neither is Boost 100.  It's drinkable, nothing more.  It's not a treat, but it won't make you gag.  The advantage to Boost is the nutrition.  If, for whatever reason, your diet isn't giving you enough nutrition, then this may help  Personally I have a lot of trouble getting enough protein in my diet, so Boost is something that I may use on a regular basis.  Not enthusiastically, mind you, but because it's one of the better choices.\n\nBottom line, it's probably as good as any other convenient nutritional supplement.  I think it's a bit pricey at a bit over $2 a bottle, but if you don't use more than one a day, it's not not a bad investment in your health.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nThai Kitchen Coconut Milk, 13.66 fl oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nOf all the coconut milk I've tried, Thai Kitchen seems to give me the best flavor and consistency.  It's good in curries, in baking, whipped as an alternative to whipped cream (you have to have the full fat version for this, not the lite), and even in smoothies.  Normally it's kind of expensive, but the price here on Amazon comes to just under $1.45 per can which is a great price.  Always assuming you can buy in bulk that is.\n\nIf you do use a lot of this stuff, Amazon is probably your best resource.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWholesome Sweeteners Organic Fair Trade Honey, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nOrganic and fair trade are two designations I like to see on products I buy. Together they're nearly irresistible, but of course a lot depends on whether the product is worth buying.  Does it taste good?  Wholesome Sweeteners honey does taste good.  It's a dark amber honey with the kind of slight bitterness you find in buckwheat honey.  It also has an odd flavor, probably because I'm unused to honey produced from South American plants.  Not unappealing, just different.\n\nIf you can find something like this that suits your tastes and covers a lot of socio-political bases as well, why not buy it?\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nIndia Tree Dark Muscovado Sugar, 1 Pound (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis is possibly the best-tasting dark brown sugar I've ever used.  It has a dark, molasses-y flavor that raises baked goods to a special level.  Now clearly it's not for everyone and everything, but if you have a recipe that can stand up to the heady flavor of molasses, and if you love that musky bitter-sweetness, then give this a  try.  I think you'll find it complex, warm and welcoming.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRice Select Royal Blend, Whole Grain Texmati Brown &amp; Wild Rice with Soft Wheat &amp; Rye Berries, 28 oz Jars (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nIn an attempt to make my diet less dependent upon simple carbs, I've been shopping for whole grain products that don't taste like sand, cardboard or twigs and pebbles.  RiceSelect has come up with a clear winner with this blend of three different grain products: Two types of rice, barley and rye.  It has a warm, comforting quality, good flavor and is just loaded with the kind of fiber we all need.  You could do a lot worse and believe me, I have.\n\nTry cooking it in stock or broth and adding just a touch of butter and salt.  I make mine in my rice cooker (If you eat a lot of grains, get one.  Trust me on this, you'll thank me in the end.  Zojirushi makes some of the best.) and it's a nearly no-fuss operation.  Ingredients in, cooker on, walk away.  Come back to an amazing meal.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeanut Butter &amp; Co. Vanilla Peanut Powder, Non-GMO Project Verified, Gluten Free, Vegan, 6.5 oz Jar\nReview:\nI've tried several PB powders in an effort to add protein and flavor to smoothies.  Mostly the result is iffy because, of course, when you take the fat out of food, you're removing the thing which conveys flavor.  You can up the flavor stakes by adding a whole lot more of the PB powder to whatever it is you're making, or you can add some sugar which is a flavor intensifier.  That's what's Peanut Butter & Company has done here.  A normal serving adds enough flavor to my smoothies that I'm satisfied.\n\nI don't much like the powder mixed into a butter, but that's not why I bought it.  In the final analysis I got what I wanted, but it does come at a substantially higher price than using plain peanut butter and a sprinkle of cocoa, so it's a trade-off.  Ultimately I may just opt to use this as an additive in baking and go back to a spoonful of real peanut butter in my smoothie.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nV8 Healthy Greens, 12 oz. Bottle (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI decided to give this a shot under the most demanding circumstances.  I poured myself a glass out of a room-temperature bottle.  If it was palatable like that, it would be fine cold, or mixed into smoothies and such.  And on my first sip I made a really unpleasant noise, at least in part because the flavor is so dramatically different from the aroma.  It smells strongly of green apples, but the flavor is very far from anything like that.  My first thought?  Ugh.\n\nBut frequently first impressions are wrong, and I kept drinking, a bit at a time.  And as I did, I grew used to the flavor fairly quickly and found that, while it wasn't insanely delicious, it was good enough for what it was, a blend of fruit and vegetables to help get what, for most people, is much-needed nutrition.  Americans don't eat enough fruits and vegetables, and if this gets some of those nutrients into us, then yay, good on V8.\n\nIs it as good for you as a piece of fruit or a serving of veggies?  Heck no!  For one thing there's nearly no fiber in this juice -- a single gram per serving -- and fiber is one of the more important things you get out of produce.  You can, if you're so inclined, add fiber with any one of the bazillion fiber supplements on the market.  I don't think it's a patch on a fresh nectarine or a plate of carrot sticks, but it'll do.  And it has a reasonable amount of vitamins, mostly C.\n\nSo the bottom line here is that this isn't a great substitute for fresh produce by any stretch, but if you cannot or will not eat fresh produce, at least it's something.  The flavor is okay, it'll make a good base for smoothies, or be reasonably drinkable out of the fridge or even on the rocks.  Not going to be my favorite thing ever, but I could honestly say that about anything that's not ice cream.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

That's because ghee is almost 62% fat contents. Per teaspoon ghee has more fat than butter. Small goes a long way here. Ghee is used in middle eastern and Indian food culturally. Ghee can be used to make other saut pan frying food as well. I use it for making omelets on frying pan to coat the pan and to season it.  Depending what you do, you can substitute a grape seed oil or canola oil with ghee for cooking. Ghee gives nutty flavor because while clarified butter is when water evaporates from butter and milk solids separates from fat. Ghee is simmered further after and there's adding yogurt during initial raw milk is churned with water to make butter.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I replaced the box the next day, and in ought a box to bring home.\n\nThere are no Artificial Flavors, Synthetic Colors or Synthetic Preservatives. No antibiotics, hormones or pesticides.

I will purchase the 12 pack for him. I am always bringing my granddaughter and daughter any treat, and now instead of fruit I can give him these.\n\nI was quite surprised how good these Amrita Bars are. Usually gluten free leaves me a little cold with the consistency, but these are made with a paste, so the taste and consistency are very high quality. The brown rice and date paste which are the base give these bars a very good taste. As with most reviewers I preferred the mango/coconut, chocolate maca and the pineapple chia. However, all of them are tasty. I brought the apricot/strawberry with me this afternoon when I went grocery shopping. I usually stop for a coffee and bun, but today only coffee and this bar. It was quite filling, tasted good with the coffee, a little sweet but the coffee tempered that for me. I am very pleased to be eating such a healthy bar, beside the better nutritional value and the lower calories, it tastes so good. I feel like I am being well rewarded for my choices.

There are no artificial flavors and no colors from artificial sources. One can will give you on average 1.5 servings. There are 130 mg calories per serving which is a very good deal. The deal breaker is that there is also 690mg of sodium. This is equal to 30% of our daily recommended value. We eat too much sodium, and this soup should be a once in awhile Soup.

The taste is not the greatest either, well not for me, I prefer the raw stevia, it taste better. It's an okay product- however to each-es own.\n\n1. This is not just Stevia- it has another raw sugar in it called cain sugar which gives 1.2g of sugar and 1.2g of total carbs and 5calories per serving- so be aware diabetics.\n\nCane sugar (raw sugar) is sucrose which has been extracted from sugarcane, a tropical plant which produces naturally high concentrations of this sweet substance. No one will claim that sugar is good for you, but raw sugar is more healthful than refined sugar because there are no chemical additives. Raw sugar is minimally processed, making it a natural product and easier for your body to digest. All sugar is high in calories and low in\n\n2. Now the Sweetleaf in the packets (THIS PRODUCT) has Inulin and Stevia Extract- the inulin which gives the fiber- so this has less than 1g of fiber- zero carbs zero sugar listed and zero calories per serving.\n\nInulin is a polysaccharide that is produced by plants such as onions, leeks, Jerusalem artichokes, and garlic. It can also be referred to as neosugar, alant starch, Alantin, and diabetic sugar. Many manufacturers are putting it in processed foods because it has tremendous health benefits. It can also be used to replace higher calorie ingredients such as fat, sugar, and flour. However, there is also some controversy about how much it should be used.\nThere are many ways that plants store energy for themselves, with inulin being one of them. As such, it can be found in the roots and rhizomes of many plants. When eaten, this substance does not increase blood sugar, which makes it an option for those with diabetes.\nThere are many benefits of inulin. It has one-third to one-fourth less food energy than that of sugar and a sixth to a ninth less energy than fat. It is also a soluble fiber which means that when it passes through the body, it creates a gel. Since fiber is not digested in the human body, it passes through to the intestine largely intact. There, it feeds the good bacteria that live there. It also helps to reduce the absorption of bad cholesterol in the body.\n\n3. Stevia in the Raw has \"less than 1g of both sugar and carbs- ingredients are Dextrose and stevia leaf extract- however zero cal per serving\n\nDextrose is an organic compound.. It is manufactured naturally in the human body from the breakdown of mainly carbohydrates, but also proteins and fats. Dextrose is the result of photosynthesis in plants and is found in concentrated amounts in fruits and honey. This white, sweet, crystalline substance can be produced synthetically from starch. The names dextrose and glucose are often used interchangeably, but it is important to note the difference. Glucose has several molecular forms. Dextrose is the biologically active form and is very common in plant and animal life.\n\nStevia is a word both for a plant and for a sweetener extracted from the leaves of that plant. stevia is much sweeter than other sugars, meaning that only a small amount needs to be used. The body also processes stevia very slowly, which greatly reduces the risk of a sugar high. it is essentially calorie free, which is why it is popular with dieters. it may be safe for diabetics, but diabetics should always consult their doctors about additions to their diet which may alter their blood sugar.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nCaffe D'Vita Imported Instant Espresso, 3-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nthis is much better than spending all that money on that very small bottle of expresso mix- it works just as well to enhance the flavor of your chocolate dishes\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nStrawberry Syrup Organic, 12 oz.\nReview:\nI just used this health Strawberry Syrup on my pancakes today, its taste is superb, it's certified organic, all natural, reduced sugar and no preservatives, the ingredients are: Strawberries, apples, cane sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon, it's also Vegan.

In English, most (but not all) bakers have adopted the French spelling of macaron for the meringue-based item, to distinguish the two. This has caused confusion over the correct spelling. Some recipes(not all)exclude the use of macaroon to refer to this French confection while others treat the two as synonymous.  Etymologically, the word macaroon is simply an Anglicisation of the French word macaron (compare balloon, from French ballon). Multiple pronunciations are technically correct depending on personal preference and context. Macaroon is a coconut cookie but French Macaroon is a meringue base cookie.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCK Products 4 Ounce Black Crystal Sugar\nReview:\nI purchased this because I had a cake order that required black sprinkles of course by the person that requested the cake.

It smells so yummy and it is just as yummy as it smells. It is not at all similar to traditional hot chocolate that you might have grown up with in the U.S.\n\nAbuelita comes in a hard chocolate disk. You melt this in warm milk and it makes a very light colored hot cocoa that smells of cinnamon and tastes wonderful. I believe you are supposed to use the whole disk if you are making many servings. To do a serving for one I believe you use about a 1/3 to a 1/4th of a disk. We have found that to make three servings, if we use about a 1/3 to a 1/2 of a disk that is the perfect ratio for our tastes in our family.\n\nAlthough the disks are hard, they are not difficult to break apart. You can take a kitchen butter knife and put a little pressure on the center of the disk and it will generally break up into several pieces.\n\nWe do not like to put things like whipped cream or marshmallows in this hot cocoa. It is simply perfect the way it is. It is easy to fix. It definitely has cinnamon in it. You can smell it and taste it but it is not an over powering cinnamon taste.\n\nWell worth the money.

Before pure Stevia, I used Splenda and later Truvia/Purevia (Stevia cut with bulking agents) for several years. The Truvia/Purevia were better than Splenda, but both the Splenda and Truvia/Purevia left disgusting residues and just didn't taste right (because of the fillers or bulking agents added). More importantly for me, I could not fully enjoy my gourmet coffee with either. When I first began using pure Stevia, I appreciated the better flavor and lack of a residue, but it still did not taste quite like sugar to me. However, after a few months, Stevia tasted like sugar to me, and I could again enjoy gourmet coffee.  In short, there is an adjustment period.\n\nPerhaps more precisely, pure stevia is \"as effective\" as sugar for \"cutting the edge\" of bitter or sour drinks and foods---the way most people use sugar. However, it is not as \"lusciously\" sugary-sweet as sugar, regardless of how much you use. For a rare, once-a-month \"desert\" cup of fine coffee, I still use real sugar and real cream. For lemonade and other very sour drinks, Splenda tastes better than stevia, to me.\n\nFor years I used KAI PURE STEVIA---until they started adulterating in.  Then I tried another Chinese brand which claimed to be pure, but was \"diluted\" with some sort of filler.  I'm not sure this \"Select Stevia\" is quite as sweet as the original KAI, but it is the best brand currently available that I've found.\n\nMEASUREMENT\nOne \"tiny spoon\" (included) of STEVIA POWDER = 1 teaspoon of sugar.  The 1 oz jars are more convenient than the 3.5 oz jars, because the included \"tiny spoon\" can reach to nearly the bottom of the jars.  It is hard to get near the bottom of the larger jars.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\nA rubber band (ideally a fat \"broccoli\" rubber band) is ideal for holding the \"tiny spoon\" to the side of the bottle.  A paperclip makes a good permanent tab for lifting the rubber band to insert the spoon.\n\nWHEN TRUVIA OR PURVIA MIGHT BE A BETTER CHOICE\n> I carry packets of Truvia with me when I travel by air, because I do not want to take the chance on being detained to explain loose white powder to TSA/DEA agents.\n> There is really no effective way to sprinkle pure stevia over fruit, etc. it is just too concentrated.  Truvia/Purvia or Splenda are better for such uses.  Indeed, if you regularly sweeten your coffee with pure stevia near your cutting board, you are likely to find all kinds of odd things, such as sweet broccoli, having been sweetened by the invisible residue of escaped stevia.\n\nIS NATURAL BETTER?\nNot necessarily.  The most toxic and carcinogenic substances known are \"natural\".  In fact, most \"flavorful\" natural compounds, including most spices and herbs, are created by plants as insect toxins.  However, natural compounds are \"designed\" by nature to interact with biological systems, either in a good way or a bad way.  If a natural compound is not obviously bad, it is probably good, or at least not harmful.  The same cannot be said of artificial compounds, which may have subtle effects.  So, on that basis. natural IS better.  However, it may be more important how the compound is processed and packaged (i.e., possibly with traces of very bad substances) than the source (artificial or natural) of the main substance.  Using well-known major brandnames is the only even partial insurance of careful processing and packaging.\n\n> [...]\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNavitas Organics Chia Seed Powder, 8 oz. Bag\nReview:\nMY EXPERIENCE\n> I was intrigued by the promise of tapioca-like pudding which didn't have to be cooked.  I love tapioca, but it is just too much work.  I was somewhat disappointed with the chia pudding.  There is a vague similarity between chia pudding and tapioca pudding, but chia pudding simply is not tapioca.\n> Chia pudding is more of a bland yogurt-like substance, which goes better with fresh fruit (berries, bananas, peaches, etc.) than alone.  Indeed, my impression from the internet is that chia pudding (made with almond milk, soy milk, or water) is most popular among vegans, and is essentially used as \"vegan yogurt\".  But, if you aren't vegan, your chia pudding doesn't have to be vegan.  Chia pudding made with milk is tasty and appealing, particularly with fruit.\n\nMY RECIPE\n> For a thin yogart-like texture 2 tablespoons chia.  For pudding-like texture, 3 tablespoons chia.\n1 cup milk.  This can be cow milk, probably even half-and-half, but vegans use almond milk, soy milk, or even coconut milk.  Other reviewers claim that fruit juices can be used.\n> 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoons vanilla.\n> 1 teaspoon sugar (or agave, honey, etc.) to taste.  Stevia works well if you want to minimize the sugar.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kal-Pure-Stevia-Extract-Powder-3-5-oz/dp/B000VRSR84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kal Pure Stevia Extract Powder -- 3.5 oz</a>\n> Mix and chill overnight.  The easiest way is to use a container with a tight lid so that you can shake it once an hour for the first several hours, so that the chia seeds fully hydrate.\n\nPS: EASY TAPIOCA PUDDING.  My research on the internet revealed that tapioca pearls and pudding are two different things.  Pudding (of any kind) is simply starch.  For a 2-cup pudding mix, use 1/4 cup of tapioca pearls which have been soaking in dairy, soy or almond milk for at least 3 hours.  If you use a vanilla or coconut pudding mix that you cook until it thickens, cook the hydrated tapioca pearls with the mix.  Tapioca pearls in a vegan pudding would be vegan.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bob-s-Red-Mill-Tapioca-Small-Pearl-24-Ounce-Units-Pack-of-4/dp/B000KEJMRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bob's Red Mill Tapioca, Small Pearl, 24-Ounce Units (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Jell-O-Cook-Serve-Pudding-Pie-Filling-Coconut-3-Ounce-Boxes-Pack-of-24/dp/B000E1FXLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Jell-O Cook & Serve Pudding & Pie Filling, Coconut, 3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>&nbsp;;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bird-s-Custard-Powder-300g/dp/B000JMBE7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bird's Custard Powder 300g</a>.

At the time of this writing, Amazon offers 3 10-oz cans of Deluxe Mixed Nuts (the same product) for $10.05 (w free shipping on >$25 orders) which is a much better deal.  For the same about $20 you'd get 6 cans = 60 ozs, which would stay fresh until opened.\n\n2) The last half of the container will be stale, unless you eat the entire 40 ounces within about a week.  I repackage the nuts into about 5 1-cup size glass jars with tight tops, and refrigerate.\n\nRecommendation: After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Almonds, Whole Natural, 1.5 Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\n\"Blue Diamond Whole Natural Almonds\" are excellent unroasted and unsalted almonds.  But, if (like me) you prefer the flavor of roasted and lightly-salted almonds, they simply are not as tasty as roasted, lightly-salted almonds.\n\nMORE HEALTHY than LIGHTLY-ROASTED LIGHTLY-SALTED ALMONDS?\n\nLIGHTLY ROASTED VS UNROASTED\n> Thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.\n> Unroasted almonds (like peanuts) are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.\n> While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds do. Bitter almonds have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods. Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer. Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw. 7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child. Moreover, a child raised on raw ordinary almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) or bitter almonds bought for cooking are safe to eat---they are NOT. The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.\n\nLIGHTLY SALTED VS UNSALTED\nHumans crave salt because it is essential for human health.  True, most commercially processed foods contain salt, and if you live on high-salt commercial foods, you may be getting too much salt.  But, if you eat even moderately healthy (mostly fruits, vegetables, and fresh meat), there is nothing \"bad\" about a few salted almonds.\n\nVALUE\nBlue Diamomd roasted, salted, almonds of any variety are special: fresh, crunchy, and delicious.  However there is NOTHING special about Blue Diamond unroasted unsalted almonds.  5-pound bags of generic unsalted unroasted almonds which I bought for cooking (at BJ's) are just as flavorful, for a fraction of the price of Blue Diamond.\n\n> Click on Stoney just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nColavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 33.8 fl oz\nReview:\nQUALITY\nIn my opinion, having used a dozen or so brands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably-priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been disappointed.  Colavita is excellent quality, dependable, and reasonably priced---the perfect combination for a daily general purpose olive oil.\n\nFLAVOR\nAlthough not an \"olive oil gourmand\", I'd describe Colavita as \"rich, smooth, and neutral\". Gourmands probably have other silly terms for the flavor, such as \"fruity\" (but a \"civilian\" would never call it fruity). It is NOT harsh or bitter like most common olive oil, NOT spicy like Whole Foods 360, and NOT \"herby-fishy\".  Colavita is an evoo (\"extra virgin olive oil\"---to us non-olive oil snobs), which means \"first pressing\".  Most olive-oil nuts consider the words \"extra virgin\" to be sacred.  Practically speaking though, the mere label \"extra virgin\" is not a guarantee of quality---most grocery store brands (evoo or not) are harsh and bitter, but some are good cooking oils.\n\nPREMIUM OILS\nBotique premium oils are are as variable year to year as wines, comparably expensive, and have to be bought the way you buy fine wine (that is, ideally at tastings, where you confirm the quality and flavor before purchase).  Some are genuinely (as in NOT-gourmet-speak) buttery and nutty---great for dipping.  Some taste like the fragrance of flowers---great for salads.  Never cook premium olive oil---use it for dipping or drizzling, or on delicate salads.  Colavita is a good general purpose oil, better than most grocery store olive oil, but is not a premium oil.\n\nCOOKING OIL\nNon-extra virgin olive oils (second or later pressings) are usually darker and stronger flavored---which adds complexity to soups, sauces, stews, bean dishes etc.  If you are using a  bitter or strong-tasting olive oil, cook it WITH the dish.  I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to every sauce, soup, stew, chili, casserole, or bean dish, etc.  However, olive oil can \"go bad\"---so unless you use alot, it doesn't sense to use a different cooking oil than you use on salads, for dipping etc. Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, and therefore a good cooking oil, but probably not the best choice for a restaurant which uses large quantities of olive oil.\n\nDIPPING OIL\nTraditionally (and in the best restaurants), Italian bread, oil and balsamic vinegar is served as an appetizer.  The diner usually mixes his own oil and vinegar at the table.  If all three are top quality, the combination can be delicious, and can even be a light meal.  Add figs or slices of apple or pear and some olives, and you do have a meal. Albeit probably heresy, in fact you can substitute fine wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice.  If I don't have olives, I usually add soy sauce or Braggs for saltiness to the mixture.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bragg-Liquid-Aminos-Natural-Soy-Sauce-Alternative-32-Ounce-Bottle-Pack-of-3/dp/B001EQ4Y4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bragg Liquid Aminos, Natural Soy Sauce Alternative, 32-Ounce Bottle , (Pack of 3)</a>. Colavita is a very good \"everyday\" dipping oil.\n\nSALAD OIL\nThe requirements for an \"everyday\" salad oil are a little less stringent than that for a dipping oil, because the heavy flavor of the vinegar, and often Parmesan, bacon bits, etc. usually dominate.  However, I rarely prepare use oil and vinegar the traditional way.  For everyday salads (or as a dip for raw vegies) I prefer olive-oil based mayo with a little freshly ground pepper, and some citrus zest.  For special salads, I use a fruity premium olive oil (and just a hint of lemon and/or orange juice and zest).  Colavita is a very good \"everyday\" salad oil.\n\nDRIZZING OIL\nA drizzling oil is an oil you pour over a dish immediately before serving, or which you serve in a carafe on the table.  If you REALLY like the flavor of \"ordinary good\" olive oil (I don't)---then you will find Colavita to be a good drizzling oil.  My hispanic wife frequently drizzles Colavita on the dishes I've cooked (with Colavita), because she likes the olive-oil flavor.  By the way, the same principle applies to the use of butter, pepper, garlic, cheese, even soy sauce---if you want the flavor to dominate, add it just before serving; if you want the flavor to be subtle, cook the seasoning with the dish.  For most dishes I prefer a rich blend of subtle flavors.\n\nHEALTHY COOKING\nI go to a great deal of effort to minimize animal fat in my diet, by very strict trimming, thorough cooking, and by chilling broth to remove the solidified fat.  However, the body needs fat and craves fat.  The ideal solution is to replace animal fat with vegetable oils which are high in omega-3s.  Olive oil is ideal for the purpose.\n\nMy Southern grandmother could not cook any vegetables without a thick slice of fatback (fatty bacon)---and indeed her vegetables were very tasty.  Speaking of which, what is the point of healthy vegetables if no-one will eat them?  The solution is to add several tablespoon fulls of olive oil, and a teaspoon of chipped ham&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hormel-Premium-Real-Crumbled-Bacon/dp/B000NERTSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a>&nbsp;to the vegies.  For the best flavor, cook the vegies with the olive oil (do NOT add oil to the cooked vegetables---unless you really like the flavor of the oil).  Season as necessary with pepper and fresh lemon juice.  Truly delicious vegetables are possible---I eat them daily.\n\nECONOMY\nThe 34 ounce tins is about half the price of the bottle per oz at this time, but is expensive compared to the last time I purchased it.  The tins are small enough to use directly. But I prefer bottles, because controlling the flow of the oil is easier (since you can see the oil approaching the spout), and it is easier to gauge the amount of oil I'm using by eye (how far the level drops in the glass bottle). So, I refill bottles from the tins.  I've been told that olive oil stays fresher in tins (measured in months and years) That becomes relevant when you don't know how many months (or even years) a bottle may have sat on a grocery shelf.\n\nGENERAL RECOMMENDATION\nAfter major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.

Before pure Stevia, I used Splenda and later Truvia/Purevia (Stevia cut with bulking agents) for several years. The Truvia/Purevia were better than Splenda, but both the Splenda and Truvia/Purevia left disgusting residues and just didn't taste right (because of the fillers or bulking agents added).  More importantly for me, I could not fully enjoy my gourmet coffee with either. When I first began using pure Stevia, I appreciated the better flavor and lack of a residue, but it still did not taste quite like sugar to me. However, after 6 months of pure Stevia, it tastes like sugar to me, and I am again enjoying gourmet coffee.\n\nPerhaps more precisely, pure stevia is \"as effective\" as sugar for \"cutting the edge\" of bitter or sour drinks and foods---the way most people use sugar. However, it is not as intensely sugary-sweet, regardless of how much you use. For a rare, once-a-month \"desert\" cup of fine coffee, I still use real sugar and real cream.  Caveat: I find Splenda to be taste better in lemonade.\n\nCOMPARISON TO KAL PURE STEVIA EXTRACT\nSWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER contains the natural fiber Inulin as a bulking agent. KAL STEVIA POWDER does not.  The Inulin does not seem to affect the flavor nor leave a yucky residue (as do the nasty bulking agents in Truvia/Purevia).  Possibly due to the Inulin, SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER dissolves easier than KAL STEVIA POWDER.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pure-Stevia-Extract-Powder-3-5-oz-Powder/dp/B000VRSR84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pure Stevia Extract Powder - 3.5 oz - Powder</a>\n\nCAUTION\nInulin is a polysaccaride sometimes used as a sugar substitute itself (for diabetics).  It has about 1/4 to 1/3 the sweetness of sugar, and about 1/4 to 1/3 the caloric content---which I interpret to mean the same calories for the same sweetness (however, in this case much of the sweetness is contributed by the Stevia).  Inulin is a current food fad, with the usual (probably greatly exaggerated) claims of benefits, including improving digestion, reducing cholesterol, particularly triglycerides, protection from intestinal cancer, etc.  On the otherhand, it causes digestive problems in some people.  I suggest reading the Wikipedia article.  If (like me), you don't have digestive problems with inulin, and it sounds as though the various benefits may be significant for your particular health problems---I suggest arranging for blood tests after a month of using inulin, and a month after not using inulin to compare.  I used Sweetleaf Stevia for 6 months, and noticed no benefits, and my blood tests showed no improvement.  Perhaps coincidentally, I did nave a digestive-related problem, and my liver function was worse.  So, I returned to KAL Stevia.  Perhaps coincidentally, after three months, the digestive-related problem has not re-occured and my liver function has improved (as measured by blood tests).  I don't know if the inulin caused me any problems, but I do not believe it was any benefit.\n\nEASE OF USE\nSWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER and KAL LIQUID STEVIA are easier to measure than KAL STEVIA POWDER, because the KAL STEVIA POWDER is much more concentrated.  However, the KAL STEVIA POWDER comes with a tiny spoon which I find works perfectly well for measuring stevia for my coffee.  However, the KAL STEVIA POWDER is so concentrated that it is difficult to sprinkle over a sliced fruit dish.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pure-Stevia-Liquid-Extract-4-oz-Liquid/dp/B000W0G62E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pure Stevia Liquid Extract - 4 oz - Liquid</a>\n\nSWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER dissolves easier than KAL STEVIA POWDER.  That is not a problem for hot drinks, but SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER or KAL LIQUID are preferable for cold drinks, such as iced tea or lemonade. I also find that unsweetened fruit cups etc. are just too sour for my taste---a few drops of the KAL LIQUID STEVIA makes them perfect.\n\nECONOMY\n$15.22 for 2 4oz bottles of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER versus $18.44 for 1 3.5 oz of KAL STEVIA POWDER (the price at the time of this writing, both with free shipping on orders >$25) may seem a bargain, but the KAL STEVIA POWDER is much more concentrated.  A 3.5oz jar of KAL STEVIA POWDER claims to hold 2381 servings.  A 4oz bottle of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER claims to hold 230 servings (= 460 servings for 2 bottles).  The economy of KAL LIQUID is probably similar to SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER.\n\nI use \"3 servings\" per mug of strong coffee, so 1 bottle (3.5oz) of KAL STEVIA POWDER = 600 mugs of coffee, to my taste; while 2 bottles (8 oz) of SWEETLEAF STEVIA = 153 mugs of coffee.  So, the KAL STEVIA POWDER is clearly the winner for pure economy, but even the SWEETLEAF STEVIA is far cheaper and superior to Truvia/Purevia.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor coffee and other hot drinks, KAL POWDER is the most economical.  For cold drinks, fruit etc. SWEETLEAF POWDER (or KAL LIQUID) is more convenient.\n\nGeneral Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.

No vinegar.  Only slightly salty.  With a mild nutty flavor.  To me, they most closely resemble ripe black olives---but milder.\n\nIf you like olives but are on a low-salt diet, and perhaps mostly use them in salads, or even sliced on pizza, Lindsay Olives are terrific, as is the price.

Bigger, better olives to begin with, PITS, and careful processing.  The pits make a huge difference in any olive---they impart a nutty flavor to the flesh.  In the case of Grabers, the flaver is nutty and buttery. If you want to impress your guests at a buffet, serve Grabers---and go for the big size 16 olives.

I can't even begin to describe the exquisite contribution this coconut made to the dish! When toasted it couldn't have tasted more like fresh coconut. It had a sweet, soft bite. I've since toasted them and used them on garnish on full-sugar cake and cupcakes that I've made for others. This goes WAY beyond generic \"Angel Flake Coconut\" you find in the store.

If you are like me and have tried endless vanillas, see how this one works for you!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKIND Healthy Grains Granola Bars, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate, Non GMO, Gluten Free, 1.2 Ounce Bar Sample\nReview:\nThese taste delicious, I broke my bar into pieces and shared around at work and everyone said they would eat them. As delicious as they are, their price for the size and the sugar factor would keep me from purchasing them.\n\n7g of sugar per very small bar. From tapioca syrup, cane syrup, honey, sugar, brown rice syrup. These are delicious and if I needed a tasty snack for a trip or something, I'd pack them because they seem like they'd travel well. But their small size wouldn't really satisfy much more than the munchies for me.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nWalden Farm Calorie Free Caramel Dip, 12 Ounce\nReview:\nHave you ever experienced a whole-body shudder?

I can't even begin to describe the taste or texture of this product in any way that is acceptable to Amazon; but if you can get some Smuckers Sugar Free caramel sauce then do it!

I found the grind size to be just right for my microwave muffins. We are doing low carb and this coconut product is very versatile for so many recipes. it's about rice-sized.\n\nIf you want coconut flour just run this through your food processor or coffee grinder (not one you make coffee beans in) and you have instant flour for thickening or coating or recipes.\n\nI recently discovered this coconut product is ideal to make coconut shrimp! Just use this instead of flour in your egg/flour wash before you fry your shrimp. Watch carefully as it browns in a hurry! Pulse some coconut with some peanut flour (Protein Plus or PB2) and use that as your dredge, it makes THE crispiest, sweetest coating!\n\nIt goes from brown to burned in seconds so keep the heat low and slow. Stir a lot.\nIf you have liquid Splenda you can make a mock Angel Flake coconut with it! (I prefer Ideal sweetener but you have to make a simple syrup with it and water to get the same effect)\nLove this product, I've tried a lot of crappy coconut over the years and as long as this is fresh when you get it, you can't get anything better!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nAlpine Spiced Cider Apple Flavor Drink Mix, 10-Count, 7.4-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI find this product to be indispensable for my recipes that call for apple juice; I use it as a sub for apple juice in everything, including salad dressing.

My only reservation is with the kidney beans.  I was able to cook them until they were tender, but the skin or outer layer of the beans remained tough and chewy.  Not inedible, just chewier than I felt they should be.  Everything else in the mix was good.  I brought 4 cups of chicken broth to a boil, then added a cup of the soup mix and a cup of pasta shells... brought it to a boil again, covered the pot, then let it simmer for about 30 minutes (it was a low simmer).  The veggies added more flavor to the chicken broth, and I didn't have to add any other seasonings (though you could).  Next time, I'll use vegetable broth for more of a \"minestrone\" flavor -- might also try to slow cooker method.\n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with the product and would definitely order from Harmony House again.  As a matter of fact, I'm kind of eyeballing their dehydrated cabbage. Mmmm, cabbage soup...\n\nIf you're cooking for one or two people, like I am, this is nice change of pace from a can of condensed soup.  You can make just enough for one, or a huge pot for a small army.  You control the ratio of broth to veggies, you can add leftover chicken, pasta, rice... and not have to chop veggies all morning.\n\nOh, I should also mention (my own preference), I specifically chose this soup mix because it had no peppers (green or red) and contained cabbage.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLean Cuisine, Marketplace, Butternut Squash Ravioli, 9.875 oz (Frozen)\nReview:\nI really liked this. Delicious taste to me. The ravioli was a bit chewy, but still good. There was a carrot stick that was rough and hard I had to toss, but the rest was perfect. Maybe that carrot piece was overcooked in the microwave. The butternut squash in the ravioli had a slightly sweet taste, I found to be very pleasant. There isn't much sauce, but it's enough to make the meal tasty. The snap peas were excellent. I'm adding this easy meal to my usual selections.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPepperidge Farm, Milano, Cookies, Dark Chocolate, 15 oz., Multi-pack, Tub, 20-count\nReview:\nVey good and fresh.

I have difficulty finding Cream of Broccoli at my local stores, and since no one else in the family will eat the stuff, a single-serving container works best for me. As for flavor: I find a bit more bland than their standard condensed version, but it's not bad.  One thing that really keeps me from giving it more than 3 stars is the amount of \"broccoli wood\" I have to spit out.  I think they use a lot of stalk in making this soup. So... yeah... \"okay flavor\", but cream of broccoli is one of my favorite soups, and the convenience factor is nice.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Packets, 100 Count\nReview:\nI like Splenda, but to be honest, I usually just buy whatever \"generic\" version is on sale... unless Splenda is on sale, then I'll go ahead and get that.

I have used ghee in the past, but never kept it on hand all the time. I think this one is a keeper. Buttery and wonderful. This is great for cooking. I used it to cook some stuffed Indian eggplants tonight. It is also good for honey butter chicken. You can use this to saute or fry. I even give a tiny bit to my dogs once in a while. This is a healthy fat that is a way better option than soybean, canola, or corn oil.\n\nGhee is meant to have a long shelf life, so I do not refrigerate it as it becomes too difficult to work with.

One of them really loves them, so I wanted to buy more. Buying a one pound bag from Amazon was much cheaper than buying four ounces from the chinchilla place. They taste very good. A bit chewy and a tiny bit tart. I don't usually add fruit to my homemade granola, but I will definitely be using some of these berries as well as Navitas Naturals cacao nibs in my next batch.\n\nThe bag is easy to open and also seals shut without issue.

The purples had a nice flavor, and I'd rate the purple as a 5 star product, although IN MY OPINION, the others weren't as good.\n\n*** on another side note, I gave this gummy candy to others, and many of them actually said that this was better than the Haribo, and they liked the fact that this was chewier. so, just because it isn't to my liking doesn't mean that this isn't a five star product. it's all a matter of preference I guess.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I'd buy it again from here. Most places(whole foods) charges about $5 a box, that would be getting 2 free from here.

It has a bitter or burnt afternote to me, one that I do not care for. I am one for Tully's Italian and Starbucks Verona and the Sumatra coffee beans, they all taste smooth to me and not bitter at all.

The Tully's Italian Roast immediately stood out from the rest--love at first sip! The other reviews are accurate by describing it as aromatic, smooth and flavorful, not bitter nor weak. I make my first cup of the morning by using one k-cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k-cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K-cup. It still holds a robust flavor but just not as heavily as the first, which is what I like to do after drinking sev'l cups.  I use cream & sugar, so this routine works for me.  You may or may not tend to tweak your ritual the same way, but it just goes to show you that you can \"think out of the k-cup.\"\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nInternational Delight, French Vanilla, Single-Serve Coffee Creamers, 24 Count (Pack of 6), Shelf Stable Non-Dairy Flavored Coffee Creamer, Great for Home Use, Offices, Parties or Group Events\nReview:\nWe are heading to Italy in Sept and bringing our coffeemaker and these mini moos along! I bought these at Sam's, for half the price, so FYI.  The expiration date is 3 months from now, early Dec.  I don't think these items ever are more than 3 months expiration.  That is the nature of the beast.  It cannot last months and months up to a year b/c it is real dairy. If you get these with an expiration time frame of 2 or so months to use up, as others have 'complained' of, then you are in the ballpark. What I like about this product vs. others that came before it, is that this is the real deal which is so much better than imitation non-dairy creamer substitutes.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTimothy's World Coffee Canarino, Italian Hot Lemon Beverage, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nFirst off, I am an avid coffee drinker, only drinking tea when I eat out at Chinese restaurants or am under the weather--then I will only drink decaf green tea. I also like the taste of lemon. I may not be a bonafide tea drinker, but I know what I like. That being said, upon receiving a sample box of Canarino and having a cough/cold this week, I tried the Canarino instead of my usual go-to green tea. I loved it! What a nice change of pace. It wasn't bitter whatsoever to my taste. I sipped it w/o honey or sugar. I used the 8oz. serving cup size, just fine. It was smooth and light and kept my throat moist and was very comforting. It reminded me of Thera-flu w/out all the added medicinals.

When I checked my last purchase on Amazon it was no longer available from that vendor. I paid $8.40 for a 5 oz. can, which really turned out to be fortunate for me -- I frantically started checking for another vendor of Hungarian Paprika and came across this terrific bargain. Even though Prime doesn't apply to this, I'm only paying $30.00 for 6 cans. Since I use 1/4 cup per recipe, I'll probably go through that amount fairly quickly.\n\nImported to the US directly from Kalocsa Paprika Ltd., Kalocsa, this Szeged Sweet Paprika is an absolute necessity if you plan on making authentic Hungarian Chicken Paprikash.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTorani Sugar Free Syrup, Coconut, 33.8 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThe product is great. I really enjoy the brown sugar and cinnamon in my oatmeal and have been using it for quite some time now. Each time I purchased it in the past it was sold and shipped by Amazon at $23.91 for 3 bottles. Torani, in most flavors, is sold locally at $4.99 for a 33.8 oz. bottle. Unfortunately, none of the local stores have started carrying this flavor yet, so I figured that paying Amazon $7.97 per bottle shipped with my Prime wasn't such a bad deal. Now Amazon has a third party selling it for $29.65 per 3 bottles, plus $8.91 for shipping. $12.85 per bottle is just a little more than I'm willing to pay for something I can order directly from the Torani people.\n\nUpdate: 09/23/2013:\nSellers may actually pay attention to reviews **SURPRISE** as the price for this product came down from $29.65 yesterday to $24.99 + shipping @ $13.75 today. Too late, though, since I purchased it directly from Torani yesterday for $22.05 + shipping @ $6.95.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nNuSci Aspartame Pure Powder 227 grams (8.0 oz) Low Calorie Sweetener\nReview:\nThis is really wonderful. I have been using it in drinks, tea, coffee and anything else that I want sweetened, including cooking with it. I mix it in my oatmeal before microwaving -- so delicious. Up until now I've been using Equal, but its first ingredient is Dextrose w/Maltodextrin (sugar) which, in my opinion, defeats the purpose of using it. Can't tell the difference between using the pure Aspartame powder or using Equal.\n\nThe only thing I wish NuSci would do is to pack it directly in a glass or plastic jar. It takes some dexterity to transfer from the plastic package. It is so much easier to use by \"spooning\" it out of a jar. As for the packaging itself, I must admit is excellent. The powder is in a heavy plastic zipped bag with the label on it, which is then placed into another heavy zipped plastic bag.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEqual 0 Calorie Sweetener, Granulated 4 oz (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nI notice that a number of people giving a one-star rating say it is not as sweet as what is in Equal packets. The reason for that may be because Equal packets contain Dextrose, Maltodextrin, Aspartame and Acesulfame Potassium. Equal Spoonful contains Maltodextrin, Aspartame, Acesulfame Potassium -- it doesn't have Dextrose in it. Dextrose is sugar (actually a simple sugar) which also helps dissolve the product more quickly.\n\nIn the past I have purchased pure Aspartame from Amazon (NuSci Aspartame Pure Powder 227 grams (8.0 oz) Low Calorie Sweetener) which is quite difficult to dissolve and it too has a different taste. However, it's good if you want plain Aspartame.\n\nI have been using Equal for  50 years and for the information of anyone terrified of Aspartame, I don't have any of the diseases with which quacks insist on threatening people who do use it.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nYork Sugar Free Peppermint Patties Dark Chocolate Covered Mint Candy, 3 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nMaltitol, Lactitol, Isomalt and Sorbitol -- the sugar substitutes used in this product can be pure poison to some individuals.

This can is very old, decades, and I was trying to figure out why it is still here. I suppose it's nostalgia because I certainly wasn't using it. Occasionally over the years I have tried to find this product and couldn't. I decided to Google it and arrived here. After reading the reviews, I realize why it wasn't being used. It is a very dark red and has a bitter, not sweet, taste. I have purchased other brands and been disappointed. None of them met the standards of the one my mother used which is why I kept trying to find this brand, hoping I just got a bad batch.

On his advice,  I've eliminated most of it from my diet, and lost 20 pounds in 6 months.

It isn't quite as good as maple syrup though, but I didn't expect it to be. It does tatse better than the usual store bought syrups, but also costs about twice as much.

I generally do not like dark roasts, especially the blends found at most popular chain coffee houses. I also find light roasts to be bland and/or weak, so medium roasts are my blend of choice. Community Coffee Breakfast Blend  definitely falls in the category of medium roast, and I like it a lot. While there isn't anything really distinctive about the taste, it's just good coffee. If I had to compare it to another coffee, to me it tastes similar to McDonald's Premium Roast Coffee, which to me is also very good. Community Coffee Breakfast Blend isn't bitter. It's somewhat mellow but not weak, and very smooth. Medium roast fans should really like it. Light and dark roast drinkers probably won't hate it either.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nACUTEfruit 8x24 Tropical Blast, 8-Ounce (Pack of 24)\nReview:\nACUTEfruit Tropical Blast is non-carbonated fruit blend energy drink that unlike most energy drinks contains 50% fruit juice and only 70 calories. It also contains 3g of Fiber, and is loaded with B Vitamins. ACUTEfruit Tropical Blast  gets it's energy mostly from the small amount of caffeine (47mg) from Guarana and Yerba Mate. It does not provide the jolt that the mega caffeine, high sugar energy drinks provide. This can be a positive or a disappointment depending on what you're expecting. There is no \"crash\" after drinking ACUTEfruit Tropical Blast which is a major plus. Taste wise, I find the apple and orange juice combination to pleasant enough. I find canned orange juice to always have a strange taste with an almost medicine like after taste, and ACUTEfruit Tropical Blast has a little bit of that. The apple juice does a pretty good job of masking it though.\n\nI like ACUTEfruit Tropical Blast. It gives me the same boost as a cup of coffee despite having less caffeine, and the ingredients are somewhat healthier than the average energy drink.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nEight O'Clock Coffee, Original Ground, 12-Ounce Bag (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nEveryone has different tastes, but Eight O'Clock is my favorite coffee.

Price wise, they cost about twice as much as a candy bar. In the end, Balance Chocolate Peppermint Patty, 1.41 ounce bars aren't bad.

A rare-ish side effect of saint johns wort is myelin sheath damage from the sun.  Basically after drinking this for a few days, my arms legs and face began to tingle after being in the sunlight for even a few minutes.  I researched all the ingredients in this tea and turns out saint johns wort, which there are TWO types of it in this tea, is the culprit.  This tea is the only thing I changed, and when I stopped drinking it, after 2 days or so, the tingling numbness in my body went away, I can now be in the sun without issue.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nTraditional Medicinals Organic Green Tea Lemongrass, 16 Tea Bags (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nWish it had a stronger ginger taste, but it's good stuff.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Rishi Matcha Travel Packs, Organic Green Tea Powder, 12 Packets (Pack of 2) \nReview:\nhigh quality, great tasting, costly though, will not purchase again unless they sell as bulk maybe 50 in a box or something.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nTraditional Medicinals Teas Pau d'Arco Herbal Tea, 16 Wrapped Tea Bags\nReview:\nQuality tea\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBuddha's Herbs Premium Organic Peppermint Tea - (Pack of Two (44 Tea Bags))\nReview:\nDecent but I prefer a stronger taste, so likely won't purchase again.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNavitas Organics Goji Berries, 16 oz.

Of course, the tin is what attracted me to the product but then I got hooked on the burst of peppermint in my mouth. There is something so old world soothing about opening the tin, gently parting the thin foldover paper, and choosing just one mint, refolding the paper and snapping the tin shut.  I've never gotten tired of that experience.\n\nAltoids, the curiously strong mints, have not changed their recipe in over 200 years, using only natural flavors.  The explosion of peppermint when placed on the tongue is truly a treat which I'll never be without.  Refreshing experience from such a little lozenge.\nAnd a delightful refresher after a meal without adding but a couple of calories.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHarney &amp; Sons Caffeinated Hot Cinnamon Sunset Black Tea with Orange and Cloves Tin 20 Sachets\nReview:\nThis is a wonderful cinnamon spice flavored tea which is caffeinated.  I prefer the caffeinated for mornings and an herbal tea in the evenings.  I ran across the Sunset tea at my local Walmart at about half the price of Amazon so I purchased a tin of 20.  The bags are mesh in a pyramid shape, giving full brewing access to the tea.  I normally use a half teaspoon of honey in my teas but this particular tea doesn't require any extra sweetner.\n\nI find that the tea bag is strong enough to brew a double cup as 8 oz. of water is just too little and makes quite a potent brew.  I keep an extensive variation of teas to suit my mood but find that this Harney and Sons Hot Cinnamon Sunset is one of my go to flavors.  As an added plus, the kitchen smells wonderful while the cup is steeping.  Even my husband comments on how good it smells and he's not a tea drinker.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMrs. Dash, Seasoning Blend, Onion &amp; Herb, 2.5 Ounce\nReview:\nThis product by Mrs. Dash is one of the better salt free blends in the product line.  I use several Mrs. Dash items and like to switch up the seasonings.  Too much pepper bothers me and this one particular blend doesn't have as much pepper in it as some other Mrs. Dash products although pepper is the third ingredient listed.  The onion and herb flavors are not over powering but of course, can be strengthened with a heavier application of it.\n\nMy household is not on a salt restriction diet but as we get older we try to cut down on it and the Mrs. Dash products give us lots of flavor without the salt, which then we use so much more sparingly.  I find the Onion and Herb flavors compliment pork really well and I like to use it on our vegetables.  We keep three of the Mrs. Dash mixtures on our spice shelf, the original being the most used.  It's a very good product that enhances the flavors of grilled meats and veggies.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKeebler Club Crackers Original, 13.7 Oz. (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nA salad or a bowl of soup is just not complete without Keebler Club Crackers.  We have eaten these crackers for many years now and after trying out several brands and store brands, always come back to Keebler.  They are so light and tender with a buttery flavor and seem to just melt in our mouths.\n\nI always have a box on hand and they stay fresh and crisp.  I roll down the top on a partially used sleeve of the crackers and gently put a rubber band lengthwise on it.  This has always worked, even in the hot humid summers. Keebler club crackers may cost a little more but are totally worth the extra expense.\n\nThese in no way resemble a saltine, which have their own place in the kitchen.  Yummy good.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBetty Crocker, Muffin Mix, Authenic Cornbread &amp; Muffin Mix, 6.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nBetty Crocker cornbread mix is by far the best mix that I've found.  Most of the mixes I've tried are much too sweet and we don't care for a heavy sweetness when paired with ham and beans or homemade vegetable soup.  It is super easy as it only requires three ingredients to be added, milk, egg and butter.  It turns out light and tender and rises very well.  It has that wonderful cornbread taste that so many of the other mixes are lacking. I've tried many recipes through the years and have not found one that is better than this mix,  the recipes make way too much anyway and I have to throw the leftovers out for the birds.\n\nI have a small cast iron skillet that I bake this in as it seems to be the perfect size and as the pan is old and well seasoned, the cornbread pops out without sticking.  I've also made muffins and cornbread sticks with it.  Actually it depends on what we're having with it that determines what pan I'll use.  The envelope makes just the right amount for the two of us and with enough left over for another meal.  If you have more than three or four in your family, you'll probably need to use two packets.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTone's Minced Onion - 15 oz shaker\nReview:\nI have had a large container of Tone's dried minced onion in my pantry supplies for years now and am constantly reaching for them.  If I'm making a big pot of soup or stew I'll use fresh onions but for small jobs, the dried onions are indispensable.  I love to put them in my tuna or chicken salads as they reconstitute with the available ground up sweet pickle juices and make a much nicer consistency of salads.\n\nI find that the onion flavor is milder than fresh onions but that is one of the reasons why I like to use them, they're not overpowering.  And I really don't like the crunch of freshly chopped onion in my sandwiches and I hardly know they're in the recipe except for the subtle flavor.  These are also great to mix with ground beef when grilling hamburgers for when I don't have any fresh onions on hand to slice.\n\nI find that they never spoil and keep their flavor indefinitely which is a big money saver as fresh onions can turn on me quite quickly no matter how I store them.  This large size container is so much more economical than a small bottle off the spice shelf. They reconstitute quickly in a little warm water if I should want to plump them up before using.  Great product!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHidden Valley Original Ranch Seasoning and Salad Dressing Mix, 16 Ounce\nReview:\nIf you are like me and use Hidden Valley Ranch and Seasoning mix in much of your cooking, then this 16 oz. container is the only way to go.  I have found such a wide range of uses that are enhanced with this seasoning mix.  To name a few; our hearty Taco Soup that is a go to in the winter, sprinkled on cubed potatoes that are then oven browned, sprinkled over baked potatoes, sprinkled on popcorn, sprinkled on steamed broccoli and green beans, mixed with sour cream or plain yogurt for a tasty dip, the applications are as endless as your imagination.  And on occasion I do actually make a dressing for salads with this!  So simple and fresh tasting. I used to only buy the envelopes but as I found the bountiful ways to use it, I had to go with the bulk containers.  As I cannot find this larger container in my local Walmart, Amazon provides a great and economical place to get it.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

These crackers are made by the same company with different name. The Yehuda crackers are made larger, crispier and tastier than the (AGF) although they are from same manufacturer. Seems that Yehuda's are thicker so there are less broken up pieces. I will not purchase the Absolute gluten free crackers b/c its not as superior as the Yehuda's. I also want to mention that although the Yehuda's seems more expensive and they are but the box is bigger, crackers are larger so if you campare them with (AGF) crackers, these are about the same price in my opinion b/c they taste better and less damaged pieces.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPamela's Products Gluten Free Whenever Bars, Cranberry Almond, 5 Count Box, 7.05-Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nYes, I love these bars.

I have some family members who now drink dark magic (caffeinated) after trying the decaf. They tell me the taste is pretty much the same  all your missing is the \"Buzz\". At first when I got dark magic decaf in a sampler I avoided it thinking it would be one of those bitter varieties. It's not it actually  has a smooth taste.

If a poll were taken  it's likely at least 9 out of 10 samurai would recommend Miyasaka Instant Vegetarian Soup.  I could say why but the FDA has rules about making certain claims regarding foods. Better if you buy the miso and try for yourself.  I consider this miso an ethnic food that anyone could relish. Convenient to take along or enjoy at home. Individual pouches.

I seldom pay much attention to the word organic on labels. So many claims on food packs. This caught my attention. I've been looking for ramen that is a more healthy choice than the budget types. Price is a consideration. I found Koyo on sale at Amazon Warehouse Deals.

Heat the rice in microwave for 2 minutes and it's ready to serve. Very easy food for anytime. I bought Kitchens of India curry products to mix with this rice. The combo makes a delicious meal item. I compare CJ Cooked White Rice to Annie Chun's sticky white rice. Different bowl design but same type rice. The plus is CJ rice usually costs less than Annie Chun's. The minus is the CJ rice bowl is neither for recycling nor is biodegradable. Inside the triangle where a recycle number would be is Korean script. Beneath the triangle is the word \"other\".  Annie Chun's bowls are biodegradable being made with corn starch.  There are so many ways to prepare rice. CJ Cooked White Rice could be a great choice.

Good price but not such a good value\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nMartinson Single Serve Coffee Capsules, Breakfast Blend, 24 Count\nReview:\nBought the Variety Pack to try some new coffees - Barista Prima House Blend, Donut Shop, and Fair Trade Colombian are the house standards.\n\nThe Martinson Dark Roast is OK - similar to Donut Shop - and about what you'd expect at a donut shop.  Not as strong Dunkin' as I would expect (or want) from a DARK ROAST.  I like my coffee to provide a rich, robust, deep flavor - just short of French or Italian or Espresso roasts - Starbuck's Morning Joe, for example.  This ain't it.  Not dreadful but nothing to displace the current house favorites.\n\nHouse Blend is pretty lame (or tame if you're being charitable).  Weaker than Donut Shop - if Donut Shop is a 4 on a 5-point scale, Dark Roast would be a 3 and House Blend a 2.  Just not much by way of rich coffee flavor or aroma.\n\nFinal word: these K-cups are being shelved and will bring them out to offer to my in-laws when they invade the house (they all drink coffee with milk and sugar so what difference does the coffee make - not that they have ever actually finished a cup - they just make 'em and then leave them all over the house for me to find after they leave...sometimes LONG after they leave since they \"hide\" them all over).

Tetley's British Blend comes close, but as the reviews suggest, Tips is tops.  Quite likely that it WAS the tea I was drinking.  Brewed according to the rules - warmed pot taken to the boiling water and steeped for 5 minutes - it is rich and flavorful (flavourful?) without being bitter or harsh.

I have always been a fan of the Crown Prince smoked oysters, but never tried the anchovies. What the hey, I bought a dozen, at $1.45 a can when I bought them. Over a dollar savings from Papa Murphy's, and even more over the cost in the grocery store. And guess what!

After about 15 minutes in the microwave (in stages) the product was still too chewy to stomach--and basically tasteless.  To be fair, the cooking instructions did not even mention microwaving.  It said to cook on the stovetop for five minutes at boiling and then cook at simmer for an additional 30 minutes.  All to prepare 1/4 cup of dried oats. I did not recall reading these directions when I ordered six boxes of these.  I might try to use some in bread, but otherwise I seem to have quite a lot of expensive, organic bird feed.\nRating:\n2.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It's very apparent they're the source of chocolate, but they're definitely more bitter than even a very dark chocolate.

This review is only for the 28 ounce package of turkey snack sticks.\n\nMy Doctor recently advised me to cut way back on my red meat intake. I have been searching for turkey products that have decent flavor. These are indeed good tasting, satisfying, turkey snacks with a nice smoked flavor. To me, the taste is very close to the beef. Imagine a 'Slim-Jim' type snack that is less spicy, and bulk packaged in one ounce sticks, also with better texture. That is what these are.\n\nThe 28 ounce package that I purchased from Amazon.com, arrived promptly and had a 'use by' date that was 8 months into the future. These are not what people would consider healthy snacks, due to the fat and sodium content. They are darn satisfying though, and at least in my case, healthier than the beef variety. My package does say 'refrigerate after opening'.\n\nEnjoy\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFiber One Chewy Bar, Oats and Peanut Butter, 1.4 Ounce, 5 Count, Pack of 12\nReview:\nOK, I ate some of the 'protein' bars and was happy with how full I felt after. These 'fiber' bars are also good, except, I found I was having 4 or 5 bowel movements a day after only one day of eating 3/day. I now limit my intake to one a day and am good.\n\nThe taste is excellent to me. What attracted me to this product was that the main ingredient is listed as \"Chicory Root Extract\". Chicory root appears to have some unverified health benefits. I sometimes enjoy a little tea made from roasted chicory root and it just makes me feel better.\n\nEither way, If you are hungry and need a snack eat one of these, two or more in a day, be sure a potty is nearby.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPeople's Choice Beef Jerky - Classic - Original - High Protein Meat Snack - 3 Ounce Bag\nReview:\nI like their 'Old Fashioned - Original - Peppered - Sugar-Free' the best.

For a serving size of a 1.1 ounce bag, the facts are: 3.5g fat, 0g trans fat, 0g saturated fat, 190mg sodium, 24g carbohydrate, 6% DV of iron. The ingredients: Yellow Corn, Sunflower Oil, Sea Salt.\n\nThe date code on the bags I received was for 10 months onto the future, I have no worry about being able to finish them by that time.\n\nThey are popped corn that has somehow been pressed into the shape of a fried corn chip. They are a little crisp mixed with the texture of popped corn, meaning they are not dry and as brittle as a corn chip. Medora did some kind of magic on the pressed chips to make them taste a bit like real corn chips. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised with the snack-ability, good job with that.\n\nI ate two bags of these and then placed an order for another 40 pack, of a different flavor. That is my endorsement.\n\nEnjoy.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeople's Choice Beef Jerky - Old Fashioned - Original - Sugar-Free, Carb-Free, Keto-Friendly - 1 Pound, 1 Bag\nReview:\nWhat can I say?

Natural, dried just right, not too chewy.

Ginger is my go-to flavor.\n The flavor is integrated into the gum (rather than just in a coating) so its not overpowering and also lasts quite a long time.\n It seems more expensive, but with about 20 pieces per box (one piece at a time is sufficient) its actually not bad. A serving of Glee is 2 pieces, so a box of Glee gum contains 8 servings.\n The packaging design is beautiful and functional. It makes me a little happy whenever I use it.\n\nGlee Gum (3/5 gold stars):\n Glee Gum is tasty when you first chew it, but the flavor disappears quickly.\n The texture of Glee is also a bit dense and rigid for my liking  especially after a minute when the sugar is gone.\n Overall, Glee is economical and fine for people who don't want to chew for very long.\n The flavors are all quite good - my favorites are tangerine and mixed berry.\n\nId much rather chew either of these gums than go back to a major brand like Trident, etc. This is partly because I prefer Glee and Simply Gum and partly because they are more sustainable. Most leading brands of gum list a gum base on their ingredients. This gum base can include polyethylene (plastic), polyvinyl acetate (wood glue), paraffin wax, fats (hydrogenated vegetable oil) and talc. Glee and Simply Gum are both made from natural tree gum (chicle), harvested by tapping Manilkara trees that grow in the rainforests of Central America. I think that both of them are far superior to the big commercial brands of gum and both deserve 5/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. Here is some more info on these two brands:\n\n Harvesting natural gum from trees can help protect rainforests and support a sustainable practice that has gone on for thousands of years.\n Natural gum also has a lower carbon footprint than petroleum-derived ingredients that are used to make the gum base of commercial gum.\n Natural gums (Glee and Simply gum) are also biodegradable  reducing biological hazards (and ugly pavements).\n In Simply Gum, most of the ingredients (sugar, glycerin, rice flour) are organically grown.\n In Glee Gum, the sugar is not organic but it is Fairtrade certified.\n Both Glee and Simply Gum are packaged in recyclable cardboard boxes  no plastic.\n Both companies and woman-owned and based in the US.\n Glee Gum works with people with disabilities and supports Trees for the Future and scholarships at the Maya University in Mexico.\nMore info on sustainable chewing gum is available on my site  greenstarsproject.

I thought the chewy Chocolate Almond and Sea Salt with Chia bars were a little better than these  tastier and less dry. These Mocha bars are way too dry for my taste, even when I eat them with a drink. In person, they don't look nearly as tasty or as almond-rich as the bar pictured on the box, and then they also taste worse than they look. The flavor doesnt translate as mocha, and theres very little chocolate flavor either.\n\nI think people will be drawn to them for nutritional content, and I think its pretty well balanced when you look at overall content. It has a carbs to protein ratio of 3.5 to 1, which is close to whats considered optimal; low in fat, very high in fiber and moderate in sodium. So the overall balance (3.5 g fat, 4 g fiber, 6 g sugar, and 6 g protein) is pretty good from a purely accounting point of view. I don't love that the protein comes in the form of soy protein isolate however (i.e. the leftovers after oil has been extracted from soybeans with hexane) but thats common to most non-organic bars that use soy protein.\n\nTheir newer bars are organic and made with several Fair Trade certified ingredients (including cacao) but unfortunately they fall apart when you unwrap them. These chewy bars hold together better but are not made with Fair Trade certified cacao and thats disappointing. They need a combination of good ingredients and well-made bars. Kashi is also a company of contradictions. For example, they are proud of their new non-GMO products (this is not one of them) and yet in 2012 their parent company, Kellogg, donated $790,000 to the NO on Prop. 37 campaign (labeling of GMO foods). They were also I the news in 2012 for misleading labeling of products as natural (and using GMO ingredients)  the Kashi's general manager responded by stating, The FDA has chosen not to regulate the term 'natural. Overall I feel that they are a mix of good intentions and some bad practices that have seeped in as the company grew (and was acquired by the Kellogg Company). The ingredients are not too bad: for example theres expeller-pressed canola/safflower oil instead of palm oil, which is nice; but I feel that there are too many  it tastes like a highly processed product. Since it contains wheat, nuts, soy and milk, that excludes a lot of people these days!\n\nI feel that overall, for social and environmental impact, Kashi is a little above average, and even Kellogg (the parent company) is setting decent goals these days on things like energy use, waste, ingredient sourcing, etc., even working with the WWF to evaluate impact for their products. These particular bars however, not having organic (except for the cane syrup) or Fair Trade certified ingredients, deserve a middle-of-the-road 3/5 green stars for social and environmental impact and also 3/5 gold stars for overall quality.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nAnnie's Gluten Free  Rice Pasta &amp; Cheddar Macaroni &amp; Cheese, 12 Boxes, 6oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nAnnies gluten-free elbows are made from rice pasta, and the vegan sauce is seasoned pumpkin and sweet potato. The pasta has good texture  rice makes good gluten-free pasta. The sauce is tasty, as long as you don't expect it to taste like cheese  it tastes like the ingredients: pumpkin and sweet potato! If you want a vegan mac and cheese then I suggest Earth Balances cheddar variety: its not gluten free, its high in sodium, but it tastes like the real thing! Annies product is unique, and props to them for developing a healthy vegan mac and cheese (high in vitamin A, decent fiber content, low sugar and fat). So, Id say if you're eating this often then go for Annies; if its an occasional teat then try Earth Balance.\n\nOverall, Id give Annies 3/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. However, some of their products are more sustainable and animal-friendly than others  this mac and cheese is vegan and made from organic ingredients and deserves 4/5 green stars.  Why not 5/5? Well, Annies is now owned by General Mills, who is considered one of the least sustainable of the Big 10 food conglomerates: check out their rating on Oxfams Behind the Brand scorecard. I like Annies but I don't love that they are now part of General Mills. You can see a concerning trend with some of Annies new products, like yogurt tubes, which are taking a step backwards in terms of sustainable packaging. Annies is fairly transparent about ingredients and company operations. They offset some of their carbon footprint through Native Energy and by supporting the Oka Forestry project. They contributed around $0.4 million to charitable causes such as school gardens, versus an annual gross profit of around $70 million  a moderate amount. They use 3550% post-consumer recycled content for paper and glass packaging, but recently improved on their packaging case for mac and cheese by replacing the top half of the case with shrink-wrap plastic! Id rather they stick with cardboard and use 100% post-consumer sources  after all, pasta is one of the products that doesnt require plastic packaging  why needlessly introduce plastic?\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nOrganic Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups by Justin's, Rainforest Alliance Certified Cocoa, Gluten-free, Responsibly Sourced, 12 Packs of 2-Cups each\nReview:\nI prefer to eat straight chocolate, but every now and then I think everyone craves a more guilty pleasure (whether something like a Snickers bar or Reeses cups) and I think Justins peanut butter cups fills this gap in a tastier, healthier, and more sustainable way. When you first try them they may seem different to what you're used to (sweeter than dark chocolate, not as sweet as the options mentioned above) but theres a good chance that theyll grow on you and youll eventually be craving more. Im not even that nuts (ho ho) about peanut butter, but Justins cups have converted metheres a good balance between chocolate and peanut butter. Im not going to discuss quality issues related to the supplier; Id suggest buying a pack locally if you want to try them out, and after that be cautious about who you buy them from (check out the other reviews). The ingredients are organic and Rainforest Alliance certified. Justins mention in their press releases and website product info that their chocolate is also fair trade, but theres no fair trade certification stamp on the product itself. One thing that irks me about Justins is that they sell a lot of single-serve nut butters in wasteful packaging.\n\nIf you eat two of Justins cups thats 8% of your salt daily value (dv) and 14 grams of sugar. That compares to 5% dv salt and 28 grams of sugar in a regular Snickers bar, and 6% dv salt / 31 grams sugar in a 2-pack of Reeses peanut butter cups. So, Justins have half the sugar, but actually higher in salt than the competition. I don't think Justins cups would lose anything if they reduced the salt content  they definitely taste a tad salty to me. All things considered, Im not going to eat any more Snickers or Reeses if I can help itthe impact on society and the planet is too great (see below).\n\nThere can be a huge difference in impact between buying chocolate that is considered fair trade and that which is not. On one hand you can support a sustainable business that in addition to giving workers a fair wage also helps the community in which the cacao is grown; on the other hand (think large multinational chocolate makers) the cheaper chocolate may come at the price of a very poor standard of life for workers, communities that don't benefit, and even child slavery. Child slavery is predominantly an issue in West Africa, where children can be sold by relatives or abducted from neighboring countries, and are forced to work long days under difficult conditions, harvesting cacao pods and missing an education in the process. Mars, Nestle, and (eventually) Hershey have issued statements that their cacao will be child-slavery-free by 2020so until then you know theres a tragic human cost behind their chocolate. Reeses is owned by Hershey while Snickers are made by Mars.\n\nOrganic certification is very significant when it comes to chocolate more pesticide is used to grow conventional cacao than almost any other crop, so organic certification is really important. For example, lindane (a neurotoxic organochlorine pesticide that bioaccumulates through the food chain) is commonly used on Cacao and is considered moderately hazardous, compromising the nervous and immune systems as well as posing a cancer risk. And yes, it has been detected in many conventional chocolate bars. It has been banned for agricultural use in the E.U. and U.S. now (which means its still in use for now in cacao-producing countries but being phased out, hopefully not replaced by some equally dubious compound in intensive farms; DDT preceded lindane and is still used on a few cacao farms). Besides the risk to the consumer, conventional (non-organic, non-shade-grown) cacao farming can be very bad news for tropical rainforests and the wildlife within.\n\nOverall, Id give it 4/5 gold stars for quality of the product and 4/5 green stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it. The newer Theo PB cups are a little better on both fronts, in my opinion.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n SNICKERS Minis Size Chocolate Candy Bars 4.4-Ounce Bag (Pack of 12) \nReview:\nI probably don't need to say too much about how they taste  youve probably tried them ;) But, in a nutshell (ho ho), Snickers are still synonymous with satisfying and are one of the best guilty-pleasure options for quickly replenishing energy. For me, they are one of the few candy bars (along with Twix which is also made by Mars) where the U.S. and European versions are both good. Compared to the other best-selling mainstream candy bars, I think Snickers has maintained quality over time, while others like Kit Kat and Reeses products have deviated too far from being actual food (and there are better PB cups out there now).\n\nSnickers loses a gold star because they do contain trans fats (from the partially hydrogenated oil). The label says 0% trans fat because they are allowed by the FDA to label it as such if its less than 0.5%. Other sources will show the trans fat content as 0.1%-0.2%. The trans fat is to me the biggest health risk in a Snickers; you know its bad when President Obama specifically calls for chocolate makers to phase it out within three years.\n\nBesides the 4/5 gold stars for quality, I think Snickers deserves 3/5 green stars for social and environmental impact (perhaps 2.5 stars for the mini version due to the extra packaging). Mars is the worlds second largest chocolate maker but is actually a leader (among these big companies) in sustainability. So, although they not are not up to the standard of some of the smaller organic fair trade chocolate makers, they are better than most of the other companies represented in places like 7-11 stores or gas stations. Read on if you want to hear more about sustainability\n\nHeres how Mars has performed on some of the sustainability goals that they set 2015 (relative to 2007 levels):\nGoal: Zero waste send to landfill. Progress is pretty good: as of 2013 they have reduced waste sent to landfill by 66%.\nGoal: 25% reduction in energy use by 2015 and carbon-neutral by 2040. Progress is slow: they have reduced fossil fuel use just 6.5% as of 2014.\nGoal: 25% reduction in water use. Progress isn't bad: as of 2014 they have reduced water use by 15%.\n\nOn other goals are on track, such as introducing recycled content in packaging (20% as of 2013), packaging recyclability (84%), palm oil accountability (84%), and coffee certification (100%). 30% of their cocao is certified, which is better than most of the very big chocolate makers, and some products such as Maltesers are made with 100% Fair Trade cacao. But Mars is still lagging behind the smaller, newer chocolate makers that use 100% Fair Trade cacao (and have a better record on energy use, packaging materials, etc.). Also, Snickers (and most Mars products) contain no organic ingredients, a pretty big drawback since a lot of nasty pesticides are used on cacao plantations.\n\nSo, I think Snickers is among best choices among the conventional, ultra-popular candy bars both in terms of quality and social responsibility. But if you want chocolate-peanut snacks that are better for society and the planet, I recommend Theos peanut butter cups (or Justins). Theos in particular are so much tastier than Snickers that they are worth the extra cost to me, and they're healthier too.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNature's Path Organic Cereal, Heritage O's, 32 Ounce Bag (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI bought these rice puffs to make some homemade fruit and nut bars - combined with nuts, seeds, dried fruit and some honey or brown rice syrup the rice puffs worked out really well. After adding the boiling brown rice syrup (or warmed up raw honey) I was concerned that the delicate puffs might disintegrate but they held together and didn't turn soggy. I also tried them with cold milk as a cereal and I thought they were OK - Id prefer if they were a bit crispier and next time Im going to try adding a little date syrup to sweeten them. I want to try their other puffed grains, like millet, especially when making bars.\n\nGluten: Brown rice itself is gluten free but this product is processed in a facility that contains wheat, so its not certified gluten free. So be careful if you have celiac disease, but if you're just trying to reduce gluten I think its not a big deal  there would probably only be trace amounts of gluten carried over from the equipment.\n\nI think they deserve 4/5 gold stars for quality and 5/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. Natures Path is a good company and better than the competition  they are considered one of the best and greenest companies to work for. Arrowhead Mills (owned by Hain) are also good but their rice puffs are not organic. Then in last place is Quaker (not organic and Quaker are owned by PepsiCo). I really like that the Natures path bag is made from #2 plastic (HDPE), the same type used for many plastic bottles, which makes them much more widely recyclable than the normal #4 bags (LDPE). It also means, no cardboard required. They have reduced their CO2 emissions per pound of product quite a lot since 2008 and aim to be carbon neutral by 2020. They donate at least $2 million each year to food banks and environmental causes and their EnviroKids products support 1% For the Planet. I think one of their biggest contributions have been in reducing packaging waste, so don't forget to recycle your bag once youve finished it!\n\nArsenic: There was a bit of a scare about arsenic found in rice so I think its useful to discuss that. Bear in mind that some organic arsenic is always found in rice because it occurs naturally in the soil and water, while inorganic arsenic is considered more harmful and may be present in the soil as a result of past pesticide use (e.g. on tobacco) or activities like gold mining. So Im only going to discuss the more harmful inorganic arsenic here. Inorganic arsenic levels are generally higher in rice grown in the U.S. (especially in TX, AR, LA, MO, where tobacco was farmed in the past) than crops from India or Thailand (Californian rice is generally fairly low in arsenic). Consumer Reports have an article (Arsenic in your Food) where they found roughly 3 micrograms of inorganic arsenic per serving of Indian or Thai rice, and around 5 micrograms for U.S. rice, with 9.6 micrograms being the highest levels found in U.S. rice. Bear in mind, that Consumer Reports are basing their safe limit (5 micrograms inorganic arsenic) on the New Jersey limit for inorganic arsenic in drinking water (5 parts per billion, ppb, which means 5 micrograms per liter of water) instead of the overall FDA limit of 10 ppb. None of the rice products in their 2012 report exceeded 10 micrograms arsenic per serving, and most of the studies on arsenic toxicity look at populations that regularly drink water above 50 ppb (50 micrograms per liter). Typical arsenic levels in water are 1-5 ppb, so a serving or rice gives you the same amount of arsenic as drinking a liter of water, or perhaps two. Its estimated that consuming 20 ppb of arsenic per day (2 servings per day of the most contaminated rice found in the U.S.) will increase your risk of developing bladder or lung cancer during your lifetime by 0.7%.  So Im not too concerned with arsenic in rice compared to other risks from processed food. Pregnant mothers could limit consumption to a serving or rice per day to be cautious, and avoid feeding rice-based products to newborn babies too frequently.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It was absolutely intoxicating.  This is really good stuff.  Very fresh.  Other brands I've tried don't stand up to it.  I can hardly wait to try it in cookies, cakes, tea, Chinese food, fermenting and medicinally.  I also have bought Turmeric from this company and it is wonderful, but so powerful that a little goes a long way.  I'm very pleased with the products from 24 Mantra.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWild Soil Almonds - Distinct and Superior to Organic, Steam Pasteurized, Probiotic, Raw 1LB Bag\nReview:\nThese almonds are fantastic.  They taste wonderful and they're very fresh.  Beyond organic?  I would say so.  They make great almond milk.  I've ground them and made almond butter, raw and toasted.  I've chopped them for fruit bread and cookies.  I've even added them to homemade bread for extra protein, and for FLAVOR.  They are very, very good.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTerrasoul Superfoods Organic Hulled Sunflower Seeds, 2 Pounds\nReview:\nThese sunflower seeds are very fresh and flavorful.  They stayed that way during shipping due to the foil lining in the pouch, which prevented contamination by stray odors, as sometimes will happen when shipping food items.  So the freshness factor is a safety factor as well.

I like to soak them in hot water, drain, then puree for a delicious cake topping to replace sugar-laden frosting.  I also chop them and add to oats for homemade granola.  I like to grind them with organic coconut for a great snack.  Apricots and coconut are a wonderful flavor combo.\n\nI'm very pleased.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nOrganic Cumin Powder - Cumin Seed Powder -  USDA Certified Organic -  European Union Certified Organic -  Pesticides Free -  Adulteration Free -  Sodium Free - 7 Ounces - 24 Mantra Organic\nReview:\nThis cumin seed powder is extremely fresh.  Being organic, it of course has a very robust aroma and flavor.  It makes wonderful ethnic recipes, especially Mexican, Indian and Middle Eastern.  It's a good deal for 7 ounces.  I use a lot of cumin, so it's better than the little jars.  I like all of the 24 Mantra's products I've bought.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNative Forest Simple Organic Unsweetened Coconut Milk, 13.5 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI have not had any issues blending the milk that separates in the can, especially in cold weather.  I've never had it clump in a big ball like the Classic did.  It's only water and coconut.  I just empty the can into the tall blender jar and whip it up with the stick blender.  Perfect.\n\nBack before coconut milk was sold in cans anywhere except Chinatown (I'm that old), there was a recipe going around (with no internet) for making your own.  Soaking dried coconut and processing it in a blender til liquefied made coconut milk.  It was labor intensive and took a while, but it was good.  Some straining was needed unless you didn't mind the tiny coconut bits.  Philippine coconut was the best.  This is what it tasted like.\n\nMy cat likes coconut milk as a treat.  Sometimes.  But this coconut milk, the Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk SIMPLE, she slurps up like a dog.  SHE LOVES IT.  When she hears me pull the can tab, her ears perk up.  Next thing I know she's wrapping herself around my ankles, purring.  So we clean out the can, one finger-full at a time.\n\nI asked the vet if it was OK and she said coconut milk is good for cats.  That's a relief.  Actually, her regularity has improved a lot since she started partaking of SIMPLE.  As has mine.\n\nI use it in my coffee every day and make great ice cream from it.\n\nI would never consider changing from this brand.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGhirardelli Chocolate Bittersweet Baking Chips, 20 oz.\nReview:\nThis big bag was a great deal on Amazon.

It also tastes very nice on toast and other food. It has a light sesame taste. But it becomes rancid and goes bad fairly quickly, even when you keep it in the refrigerator. Because this is expensive, it is simply not worth it for me. There are issues with the bottle cap -- it does not stay on very well.

Then I went wild, and I began sprinkling it on everything I ate. That was a mistake, because I think I developed an allergy to it. It began to upset my stomach. My advice is -- use this in moderation. It is very strong.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\n Indus Organics Turmeric (Curcumin) Powder, 1 Lb Jar, Premium Grade, High Purity, Freshly Packed \nReview:\nFor over a year I added this to coffee or tea because I read it had a lot of health benefits. It is supposed to be a natural pain reliever. For some people, it helps relieve inflammation. If I try it again, I will probably get a different brand. This brand of turmeric is very gritty. I don't think it is fresh. After taking it for a year, it did not make my health better or worse. It did not relieve my back pain. But it stained my teeth. Turmeric will stain anything it touches. This brand tastes awful. Don't put it in a smoothie. Some people put turmeric on their face, as a facial. There is also a hair remover recipe that uses turmeric.\n\nI did not experience any side effects from taking this. But some people will experience side effects and allergic reactions from turmeric. It interferes with some medications. Because turmeric originates from other countries, the powder is sometimes mixed with dye and inedible or unsafe substances. Turmeric powder should be a gold yellow color. If it is more of an orange red color, then you know that something suspicious is in it.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nKevala Organic Raw Sesame Seeds 1Lb\nReview:\nRaw sesame seeds have a better nutritional value than toasted sesame seeds, so I wanted to try them. These seeds have a very bitter, unpleasant taste. They would be okay to cook with. But I like to sprinkle sesame seeds on top of food, and these seeds are not good for that. I really enjoyed this same brand's toasted sesame seeds. The difference in taste between raw and toasted sesame seeds is like night and day.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSunButter Organic Sunflower Seed Spread Creamy - 16 oz\nReview:\nThis contains only Roasted Organic Sunflower seed. No sugar. No salt. It contains 25% daily value of magnesium and 40% daily value of vitamin E. That is pretty healthy. I love sunflower seeds. But this does not taste like sunflower seeds. It tastes gritty, grainy, oily, burnt, and bitter.  It is bitter because it has no sugar. It tastes burnt because maybe they roasted it too much. A lack of sugar is healthy. But a nut butter that tastes bitter and burnt is not yummy, in my opinion. Maybe I could visualize a field of beautiful sunflowers as I eat this, and then it would taste better?\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It is sweet, almost tastes like mapley-molasses, and has no bitter taste to it at all.\n\nNow, the container is a different matter. Yacon syrup is very thick, and some of it tends to stay in a sludgy, solid mass in the bottom. If the syrup was packaged in a jar, it would be much easier to mix up. After struggling with it for awhile, I finally poured as much of the syrup as possible out of the bottle, and then added some hot water to it, shook it up, poured it into a glass jar, and refrigerated it.\n\nI shall be able to use it this way, although it is a bit watered down.

A touch of salt, and I had some really good popcorn!\n\nI tasted it right out of the jar, with a spoon, and it tasted smooth and pleasant. Last night, I made some buttermilk and teff pancakes, and cooked them in it. The oil smoked a lot, but I had it on a very high heat - simply because I was trying to get finished before my husband's burger was done.\nThey tasted great!\n\nI like how this is obtained, without destroying any natural habitats, and am pleased with the taste of it.

The taste was refreshingly different from the sea salt we have been using, AND, this morning, my fingers were not bloated.

The metal foil pouch only says \"Non Irradiated\", not organic as claimed on the Amazon product page.  That's the only reason I give it three instead of five stars.  I thought it was too cheap to be organic.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Natural Products 2693 Fenugreek seed powder, organic 16oz\nReview:\nI bought Frontier because of the bad review on the competitor brand.  It smells and tastes like fenugreek to me.  I only use 1/8 or 1/4 tsp because fenugreek is a strong seasoning and can overpower a dish in an unpleasant way.  I definitely notice when it is missing, though, so I've got to have it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCoconut Pacific 100% Pure Organic Extra Virgin Raw Coconut Oil, 4-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI thought I'd try this coconut oil because it comes in glass instead of plastic and the reviews were good.  I have only tried one other coconut oil, Aloha Nu, before this one.  Aloha Nu may have spoiled me with its freshness and strong smell and flavor of coconut.  I'll definitely be going right back to Aloha Nu even if it does have a plastic bottle.\n\nThe Amazon description says the Coconut Pacific is cold pressed, but it doesn't say that anywhere on the four 4 - ounce glass bottles.  It does say it is raw and virgin but it is way too mild with very little freshness or coconut in the smell or taste.  I have some serious doubts about whether this coconut oil is truly raw or may just be made from lower quality coconuts than the Aloha Nu, which I had little doubt about being raw and made with quality coconuts.  Some people go out of their way to find this mildness so Coconut Pacific may be to their liking but not mine.  It is always liquid and would probably make a fine tanning oil.  The four small jars are inconvenient and overpriced overall for a mere 16 ounces, but I'm keeping the cute little jars for when I want to give somebody some seasonings or something.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nManitoba Harvest Organic Hemp Oil, 8 Fluid Ounce\nReview:\nSince I've been on the hemp oil bandwagon I've tried five brands.\n\nManitoba Harvest, Just Hemp, and Swanson were very bland, so I give them three stars.\n\nNutiva was flavorful but has an off taste, so I give it four stars.\n\nCanada Hemp Foods is the best tasting, so I give it five stars.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nManitoba Harvest Hemp Hearts Raw Shelled Hemp Seeds, 2oz (Pack of 12); with 10g Protein &amp; Omegas per Serving, Non-GMO, Gluten Free\nReview:\nI can't tell the difference between Manitoba Harvest and Swanson.  It's bland, but very easy to eat.\n\nIt's definitely a superfood with a ton of magnesium and manganese, which are both very hard to find in food.\n\nIt is also very high in both Essential Fatty Acids.  Even though it is just the inner meat with no hull, it still has 1 gram of fiber per tablespoon, too.\n\n19 Nov 2017 update:\nThe Swanson I just got is a bit gritty, so I downgrade it to 3 stars.

I bought this cheaper at my health grocery.  You can buy this honey at many health food stores, too.  I've tried 11 raw, most of which were unfiltered, honeys, and I don't have any real complaints about this one.  It is waxy, which is common, but it is very hard, making it fairly hard to dig it out with a spoon, even though it melts easily and completely in your mouth.  I suppose this is a fairly minor problem, but I wouldn't buy it again.  It is a very mild/bland honey, which some people may prefer.  That said, I only found one raw, unfiltered honey on Amazon that I liked a little better.\n\nThe Amish Mountain honey is a little more expensive, but it has a little more flavor and a nice honey like consistency.\n\nI also found a local honey at my health food store that is a dark desert mesquite honey with a normal honey like consistency and lots of flavor for a honey.  It is also cheap, but Happy Bear honey is probably only available in Arizona.  That's the only reason I didn't give this YS organic honey five stars.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nReally Raw Honey, Totally Unprocessed, 5-Pound\nReview:\nThis is a fairly good honey.  It is soft with a mostly pasty but also some honey like consistency.  I didn't notice any off flavor or smell.\n\nThe capping is quite awful, though.  You aren't doing yourself any favors by chewing and spitting out the wax layer on top to get the last drop of honey out of your jar.  It sticks to your teeth and is quite nasty.  None of the other raw, unfiltered honeys had this problem even though many did have a waxy consistency throughout.  Once you get through the top layer, though, it is a good honey without any other faults.\n\nI would rate it about the same as the Wee Bee, and below the YS organic and Amish Mountain.  The YS organic has a hard, waxy texture, which could be a usability problem for some people.\nRating:\n3.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It was great to eat with grilled sausages and meats wrapped in tortilla flat bread.\n\nI can use half a cup of this product and half cup of TVP by Bob's Red Mill to make a healthy dinner when I backpack.  It can be a fast party bean dip mixed with pico de gallo and minced avocado.\n\nAt home I saute chopped onion and add half a can of diced green chiles into the pot with the beans.  I also use chicken stock instead of water.  The result is FANTASTIC!  No need to add more salt because chicken stock and canned chile pack salt already.  I'd eat it with roasted chicken breast.  The drier white meat tastes super delicious eaten with the embelished black beans.\n\nIt takes no time rehydrate, offers healthy calories, and is filling.

There were some dry clumps.  I guess I did not stir long enough.  It tasted better after being in the fridge.  I put the whole thing is a tupperware for 2 weeks before using it as a spread on my toasts.\n\nIt turns out to be a wonderful spread material, not too thick to make it difficult or too runny to drip.  I put Trader Joe's Just Grilled Chichen meat on top and make a lunch sandwich out of it.  It's a fast, delicious, and healthy lunch.

I think I finally found one that I'd stay with, until someone comes up with a better/tastier/easier product.\n\nThis is s small palm sized waffle, not hallow but semi soaked (moist).  It will crumble therefore don't take it out of th package (the package can catch the falling crumbs)\n\nTo open is easy, just tear the folded area with your teeth or fingers (the tab in the back where the nutrition info is).  It will open the pack right in the middle exposing half of the waffle.  Just hold the half that's still in the package and start eating.  This is the fastest and safest way to consume this product while on the go (I did just that while hiking, holding my poles in one hand and eating this from the other hand).\n\nHaven't tried the chocolate flavor yet but I love all three (strawberry, vanilla, and honey) that I've tried.  Bought Vanilla and Honey from Amazon in bulk.  I know I will finish them based on my scheduled hikes coming up in the remaining 2012.\n\nAt 160 calories, it is a good hourly snack.  But the reason I bought it is because it tastes GOOD and no need to work hard to eat it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Brown Rice Farina Creamy Rice Hot Cereal, 26 Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI love Dr. McDugall's orginal organic instant oatmeal (discovered it as a backpacking food) that I end up having a pack or two each work day morning as breakfast.  Since I don't want to get tired of it, I have been looking for alternative hot breakfast and ended up finding this one.\n\nI had grits for only once in my life time therefore I did not know what to expect.  Granted, this product takes more prep time than instant oatmeal.  After a bit branstorming I found a quicker/no fuss way to fit it into my morning routine.\n\nThe night before I'd put 1/4 cup of it in a bowl and a cup of water, add a bit of salt or chicken stock (powder form), stir and then cover the bowl with a plate.  Let it soak over night.\n\nIn the morning while getting ready for work, I put the bowl with cover in the microwave to zap it for 3 minutes.  When zapping is done, stir a bit and let it sit.  By the time I am ready to eat it, it'd almost be perfectly soft, gooey, and not too hot.\n\nI prefer eating it with dried pork (pork sung) and diced pickled turnips.

I was never a tea drinker - only when I was sick. But I love this hot or iced. I brew a pot every day. No bitterness like green tea and you can even steep it too long and it's fine. If you get addicted to Rooibos Rocks, get the Breville Tea Maker - it's fantastic.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Organic White Chia Seeds 12oz2 pack\nReview:\nI'm willing to pay more for white chia just because they are more appetizing.

My dental hygienist recommended xylitol. Works for cooking and baking and no one will ever know. I do take exception to the sweetness rating. On fruit it's equal to sugar, but in drinks like lattes or yogurt, I need double at minimum. No side effects for me at all.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNutiva Organic, non-GMO, Premium Ground Chia Seeds\nReview:\nGreat quality chia at a fair price.

Oh, and I also love my stash double chai.  I guess, for me, I prefer my flavors straight and not mixed.  There wasn't enough chai and there wasn't enough vanilla but I think it must be me and my preference.

It's great for skin, hair, cooking etc.  However this time I received different bottles that are clear and tall - sort of like a mayonnaise jar.  The issue is that this time I have teeny tiny lumps that are VERY hard to melt and have to be crushed between fingernails in order to utilize them.  So... I'm not sure what is up with that as it's not pleasant to rub on, nor is it fun to cook with it because you end up with teeny bumps mixed in with the food.  They are about the size of a grain of millet and a bit harder than that.  Don't know what the problem is but....\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nTERRA Sweets &amp; Beets Chips, No Salt Added, 6 oz. (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI just recently found Terra Chips and have sampled quite a few.  I really like these chips because they seem to be more textured than some of the others.  I also like the more natural flavor, I can actually tell if it's a beet or a sweet potato.  I find them very satisfying and appreciate the lack of added flavors.  They are crispy, crunchy and slightly sweet... yummy!  I also got a better deal here at Amazon than if I'd bought the same amount at a local grocery store (that is if I can find them).

A friend had some of these and now I'm hooked!  The boxes arrived quickly and the candy has a yummy flavor.  One candy is 30 calories but it lasts quite awhile so it's better for me than those I can gobble up or I tend to gobble too many.  I read some other reviews about consistency of flavor but I can't comment on that.

She eats tapioca with some green beans & carrots so the bullion is an added treat that really flavors her food better.  (she eats rabbit too so not a vegetarian dog).  I agree with another reviewer that it can be difficult to get all of the lumps out and also the palm oil clings to everything when you make it.

To jazz things up, I've been adding fruit, peanut butter, coffee, etc.  When I heard about PB2, I decided to give it a try.  The 6.5 oz sizes allow you to give the product a try before committing to a large quantity.  PB2 is very light and powdery.  It takes 2 Tbsp. (45 cal) to give a good peanut flavor.  The regular PB2 is better than the chocolate variety.  The chocolate flavor isn't very intense with more pronounced PB flavor.  It mixes well with the shake mix and tastes good.  The price is high considering the small number of servings you'd get per jar.  This was an ingenious way to make the by-product of pressing peanuts for oil into a valuable commodity!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHershey Holiday Stocking Stuffer Shapes Chocolate Assortment, 23.1 Ounce\nReview:\nThis assortment was appealing for stocking stuffers.

The mild flavor, complementary texture and good nutrition make these berries an important addition to the family cupboard. For use in chili, prepare the sauce and berries separately, then simmer together for 15 minutes before serving.\n\nJanuary 2015 update:\n\nHow time flies! Six boxes of Einkorn Berries (still in the shipping container) were stored in a closet for over a year; I had drifted back to a favorite staple: organic short grain brown rice.

Since coffee is the first part of my morning ritual is my beloved cup of coffee.  I've been accustomed to K-cups for so long but were finding them a little too wasteful and costly for my taste.  Instead, I brew a pot of this (most of the times two pots for us) and we can drink this without all of the acidity and stomach issues that a regular cup of coffee can sometimes cause.\n\nThe only difference i notice is in the strength ... I feel like I have to use a little bit more of this coffee to make the pot as strong as I want it.  Still though, this coffee is a stomach saver and I recommend it for anyone who has a tough time with stomach acidity for that morning cup of coffee.  Tastes great too.\n\n26 April 2017 - still drinking this coffee but have alternated it with Breakfast Blend by Folgers which is a milder blend.  This Simply Smooth should be renamed the gut saver ... still works great and for me, a noticeable difference.  I have to add a few more grounds to get a stronger blend but this does not alter it's stomach saving qualities.  This stuff works.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTattle Tea Earl Grey Black Tea, 5 Ounce\nReview:\nI am a fan of the Tattle Tea brand.  This Earl Grey tea is smooth and not bitter at all.

I would like to see a zip lock or something better than the tape.\n\nDelicious tea, a 3-5 minute steep (depending on how you like it) and you get a wonderful, aromatic cup of Earl Grey without the bitterness.  I have found many Earl Grey teas leave a bitter taste.  Not this one.  Smooth and delicious.\n\nWe are really enjoying it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Glutino Gluten Free Breakfast Bars, Apple, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI am trying to move to more of a Gluten Free type of diet and just can't give up my sweets.

Sucralose is Sucralose and that's what Splenda is (with a bulking agent added).\n\nThis box of 400 was a great deal, so I nabbed it.\n\nAs far as the sweetener is concerned, we found that we like this one over aspartame, saccharin, stevia or whatever else is out there.  I only use Splenda to sweeten my hot tea on occasion and my partner uses a packet for her coffee.  It provides a great level of sweetness without the aftertaste.  No aftertaste is the real key for us.\n\nAspartame always gave me a headache, saccharin has a funky aftertaste (I remember drinking&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tab-Diet-Soda-12oz-Cans-Pack-of-6/dp/B0014R6TJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tab Diet Soda 12oz Cans (Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;which was one of the first diet colas when I was growing up and it had that Sweet and Low aftertaste.)

I love it like I love Maple Syrup.  One of God's great, natural gifts.  That said, sometimes messing with nature doesn't yield the expected consequences.\n\nI love Cinnamon a lot - like cinnamon toast.  Could eat it every day.  :)  I also love spun, creamy honey.  I thought that this honey would contain a subtle touch of cinnamon .... just enough to add character to the concoction.  I was wrong about that!  The cinnamon seems so strong and artificial that it really turned me off - but the packaging says NATURAL cinnamon.  Maybe they need a lot less of it.  The taste of cinammon is the kind of cinnamon you get from a Fireball ... not the kind of cinnamon you get from cinnamon toast.  I was hoping for the latter.\n\nMy Mom (who is 86 and with diminished taste buds) appreciates the honey and does not mind the taste of the cinnamon.  But she could not reconcile the price with the product.  That's not an age thing ... I wouldn't pay the slightly less than $10 for this product.

I had tried one other brand before and it was quite bitter tasting. This cacao tastes fresh, and when mixed with a fruit, walnut and greek yogurt salad for dinner as well as with a hefty morning smoothie (loaded with raw, organic hemp powder and kefir, etc.),it lends a really delicious chocolate flavor.

When opening the bag the aroma was very fresh and  \"coffee-ie\". To me, it is medium bodied but full flavored with absolutely no bitterness. It is very smooth and well-rounded in taste and I noticed no subtle or unique flavors, only an excellent coffee flavor.\n\nI like that it is a medium-dark roast because a medium roast usually lacks boldness whereas a dark roast can be too overbearing with that too toasted, often bitter, taste. This comes off as being the best solution between the two.\n\nThis coffee is so good I can leave it at room temperature for hours in a tight lid jar or thermos, and after SLOWLY reheating it, it will taste just about as good as when first brewed.\n\nThe beans are a combination of 50% Honduran Peaberry/50% Guatemalan San Antonio.\n\nAnd, the price is outstanding for these high quality coffee beans!\n\nThis will be my regular java from now on.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Frontier Kelp Powder Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bags (Pack of 2) \nReview:\nAs far as powdered kelp goes, this is the best I have tasted.

It is the first thing I crave when I'm hungry and it's the only thing I can keep down when I'm hung-over. Ramyun has been and will always be my comfort food although I consider them very unhealthy. When I first spotted the Black Shin Ramyun on Amazon, I thought it was too expensive and didn't want to buy an entire box especially while I've been trying so hard to stay away from ramyun products to reduce my sodium and other toxic intakes. After many fruitless searches at nearby Asian markets to try a few packets, I ended up getting a case from Amazon after several months of hesitation; what can I say...I have to try all ramyun that I notice. Upon trying, I must say that I'm not disappointed at all and this is my new favorite ramen for the moment. The broth is thicker (from the beef bone extract powder) and has a bit of miso flavor very similar to the restaurant quality Japanese (non-instant) miso ramyun. It is definitely not as spicy as the regular Shin ramyun, but it has much more complex flavor and tastes more home-made with bigger chunks of mushrooms, hot peppers, etc. It is unbelievable that the product is MSG free with its play on all my taste buds, and I was very impressed that the product didn't make me feel as tired as most ramyun usually do after consumption. I'm very happy that I still have many packets left, and I'll savor them for all they're worth, which is actually much cheaper than comparable restaurant ramyun and home-made noodle soups.\n\nupdate 4/4/2013:\nI've subscribed for an auto-delivery subscription and unfortunately have been enjoying the ramen a bit too often. The nutrition fact shows that a package serves 2, but that is unrealistic as most will finish an entire package by themselves. The sodium intake for a package is 1840mg (76% daily value) and total fat of 18g (28% dv) if you finish the soup! The sodium content is actually improved from the original (Gourmet Spicy Picante) Shin ramen's 2100mg. I try to make it a bit less evil by adding some cabbage, green onions and other vegetables for additional roughage and flavors. Adding fresh hot peppers or Jalapeos to the ramen makes it even more amazing. Sometimes I'll even drop an egg for additional protein, but try not to consume the york. I avoid drinking the liquid to cut down on sodium but boy is it hard to stop once you start... Having a constant supply of this ramen is dangerous but I don't have the heart to stop the subscription because I can't find it locally.

The veg flakes have bigger \"stuff\" and the broth tastes deeper, almost as if they're different products. I used to have this on auto-delivery when it used to cost around $10 but now at around $25 it's overpriced.

The Sapporo lacks the dried vegetables and the mustard mayo, but the core flavor is very similar.  You can add your own vegetables as instructed and purchase the Japanese mustard mayo if desired, and you'll spend less than a dollar as to over $3 per each package of Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba. The preparation time is a little over 3 minutes for both products with boiled water, although Sapporo lacks the fancy packaging.

Although it is still a tasty version of an instant Jjajangmen (all instants are very different from the real thing), it's not noticeably different from the old long-standing chapagetti in its flavor.

(Sadly these days counterfeit honey is a rampant problem - the raw stuff is hard to counterfeit, but rest assured this is an ethical supplier.\n\nThe health benefits of raw honey are many as it's a live food, full of enzymes, and acts as prebiotic (containing substances that contribute to a healthier gut and flora in the entire body).\n\nIt is hard to avoid completely all the processed, 'dead' foods in the modern world, that do little more than add calories and contribute to disease, so adding things like this to our diet, can help a lot.\n\nI like it in tea, I put it in the cup first and then pour in the hot water and stir it.\n\nI especially love it in a broccoli salad I make - using chopped/grated broccoli stalks & carrots,  organic raisins or dried cherries, and Vegenaise with a tablespoon of this honey -- it is DELICIOUS and a sweet tooth satisfier!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBare Fruit Organic Granny Smith Apple Chips, Gluten-Free + Baked, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nFirst of all - conventional apples are one of the 'dirty dozen' of produce to avoid, so finding an organic version of dried apples to snack on is wonderful. I first got these at Costco like others here, but I am going to order here now.\n\nThey are nice alone - but try them with a bit of organic raw cheese, some pistachios or healthy crackers - delicious! The combination of the tangy with the salty /creamy is mouth watering and satisfying.\n\nMuch preferable if you are having a sweet tooth to do this as opposed to candy or pastry. You do have to watch the quantities because the sugar grams will add up, even though it is natural fruit sugar.\n\nI really encourage parents to get these for their kids as a snack, and try them with cheese or something salty.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n3 Small Venus Flytraps - Fly Trap - (Dionaea Muscipula) Carnivorous Plant 3 Inch Pot\nReview:\nI will echo other reviewers about how responsive and responsible the seller is. The plant arrived quickly with good instructions, and the seller even followed up to see how it was doing. It's a fascinating plant with its opening and closing 'mouth' and the fact that it's carnivorous! I got it hoping it would help with my fruit fly issues. I haven't seen anything catch anything so far, but maybe needs to grow bigger to do that. I\n\n have it in a sunny window and keep the bowl it sits in 1/3 filled with distilled water, as instructed.

Rather than completely cutting out bread, I make a multi grain bread substituting 1/4 of the flours with coconut flour. I use some whole wheat, rye, buckwheat, flax and oats. All organic, found here on Amazon. I am not gluten sensitive, so I add a couple tablespoons to get a better rise. There are many web sites for using this flour to make breads, muffins pizza dough, and other things without gluten and other grains. We eat the bread sparingly of course. At first I was disturbed by the use of so many eggs in the preparation of \"bread\" using only coconut flour. However, I have recently read the best selling book \"The Great Cholesterol Myth\" by Jonny Bowden.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Great-Cholesterol-Myth/dp/1592335217/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Great Cholesterol Myth</a>(Available on Amazon, of course).\n\nIf it is true that we have been misled regarding cholesterol and eggs, (by the drug companies)  then using them with this flour is not going to cause a problem. One fourth cup contains 22 carbs and 16 grams of fiber. I have seen it said that this makes the flour a net carb serving of 6 grams.

I was astounded by the apparent way we have been manipulated (politics!) to believe that coconut was a bad thing. Finally doctors and nutritionists are speaking out.. Their advise?

Dr. Gregor compared the benefits and antioxidant power between the green and white tea.  White tea is  less processed than the green, and the most processed is the black tea.  White has even more benefits when lemon juice is added. The best news is that cold brewed  tea is as beneficial as hot brewed.\n\n I make a three quart pitcher with 8 white tea bags and two bags of Celestial brand cinnamon apple spice tea. I add a half cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of Truvia.  This is cold brewed overnight.

I have incorporated them into my homemade granola too. 1/4 cup contains about an ounce of dried berries, and is considered a daily serving of about 100 calories.\n\nI understand these are very easy to grow in containers and I am looking into purchasing a few plants. I have a dehydrator which will be vey useful, I'm sure. I'm very pleased with these overall, but they are expensive and if I can learn to grow my own, I will be even happier.\n\nP.S.

I've been buying their products for over 20 years and have never been disappointed. I've been cooking meals for over 45 years, and almost always used dried herbs, and this is the best dried sweet basil I've tasted. I cant make my tomato sauce without it. It tastes great, plus it's non-GMO & organic! Great taste and aroma, as fresh as dried can be.\n\nThis is the same product as Simply Organic basil (same company) you get in a .54 ounce glass jar. I recommend buying one jar (see link below), then buy this 16 ounce bag to refill the jar. You get nearly 30 refills in one bag! That's well over $110 worth of refills! The one pound bag is a great bargain and is enough for you and a friend. You can't go wrong. Great product, buy in bulk to save money. I buy most of my herbs and spices from Frontier and Simply organic in the same way - I buy one jar of Simply Organic and refill with their Frontier Organic bulk products.\n\nComes in a well sealed Mylar bag that can last for a couple of years if kept well sealed. And if you have any questions, the people at Frontier and Simply Organic are very friendly and always helpful.\n\nWhat is SWEET Basil?\nSweet basil (Ocimum basilicum), also called basic basil, Mediterranean or European-type basil, and is the most common basil grown, sold and used in the United States. Its most often used in Italian cooking and in soups but can also be used in Asian dishes such as Thai (as a replacement for Thai basil).\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Simply-Organic-Basil-Certified-Organic-0-54-Ounce-Container/dp/B000WS08YI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Simply Organic Basil Certified Organic, 0.54-Ounce Container</a>\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHeinz Twin Pack Organic Tomato Ketchup, 88 Ounce\nReview:\nThis is my fallback organic ketchup brand. I've tried many others, but I only like Heinz and Annie's so far. I prefer Annie's Organic Ketchup but I can't always find it in local stores or online at a decent price. So, when I can't get Annie's I get Heinz. There is a difference in taste from Annie's to Heinz and from Heinz Organic to Heinz regular. Heinz Organic has a bit of a bite to it (compared to regular Heinz), but not so much that you don't get use to eat by the end of your first meal. Just like anything else, once you get use to it you have trouble going back to what you use to eat (regular Heinz). So, if you can get Annie's Organic Ketchup I recommend it, but if you can't, try this and I don't think you'll be unhappy at all.\n\nPS) Annie's has a completely different taste, not as sweet as Heinz, with more of a robust, rich, deeper flavor. It takes getting use to too, but I hate regular ketchup after eating Annie's.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAnnie's Organic Saltine Classic, Baked Crackers, 6.5 oz (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nMY REVIEW:\nHere's my review of Annie's Organic Saltine Classics (what Amazon is calling \"Bunny Classic Crackers Saltines\"):\n\nI love them. I prefer them over Nabisco Premium (my old favorite) for many reasons. First is the flavor; Annie's Saltines taste like traditional oyster crackers. I didn't realize it until after I tasted them, but I prefer the flavor of oyster crackers over traditional saltines. But I think they taste more like Westminster brand oyster crackers (a richer flavor) than Premium or Sunshine brand oyster crackers. They're also not too salty, light but crisp & crunchy, and of course the fact that they're organic is a huge plus. They taste great with cheese slices or spread. They also hold up well when spreading peanut butter & jelly, butter, or cream cheese on them.\n\nAdded on 11-9-14: The price has gone from $19 to $29 since my purchase. This product is not worth $5 a box so I am now ordering Late July brand, which is currently $38 for 12 (about $3.15 per box). If Amazon keeps raising prices to ridiculous amounts they're going to loose my business as well as thousands, if not millions, of other consumers.\n\nSee below for cautions regarding reviews/ratings, return policy, confusing item names, and more.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nRETURN POLICY:\nOne huge caution before you buy - Grocery Items Can NOT Be Returned, for any reason, as per Amazon's return policy. I'm normally a huge fan of Amazon and their more than fair return policy, but when it comes to grocery items their return policy falls short, since some grocery items may be damaged by mishandling or improper storage, may have gone bad, etc. I personally would have no problem ordering Annie's Saltines again, even with this return policy, because I have faith in most items shipped from Amazon. However, I did receive other grocery items in the past that I felt were not up to par and could not return them.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nSHIPPING & CONDITION OF PRODUCT:\nAlthough this is not reflected in my star rating, I should mention how well they were packaged and that they were not damaged in shipping. The six boxes were wrapped together and shipped in a box with air pack cushioning. Only one or two crackers were broken in each box, at most, and I suspect that happened in the factory. I ordered them in July 2014 and the product expiration printed on the box was March 2015. So consumers who are worried about getting broken or expired product, I have had no problem with these issues.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nMISLEADING STAR RATINGS:\nI've tried many different Annie's crackers & cookies. Some I give 5 stars, some 1 star. It should be noted that the star ratings on this page are MISLEADING. As of August 2014 Amazon is lumping several Annie's Cracker flavor reviews together. This means the star rating you see is for ALL the flavors combined. Each flavor is and should be considered a separate product with their own rating, but they are not. The only way for sure to know how other consumers rate each flavor is for you to pay close attention to the details of the review. If the reviewer's purchase is verified Amazon will post which flavor they're reviewing, but you must look closely at the review to see this. It's easily overlooked. For those reviewers whose purchase is not verified by Amazon, there may be no way to know which flavor they're reviewing.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nCONFUSING ITEM NAMES:\nThe titles (names) Amazon shows for these products sold on this page are also misleading. Even though Annie's has stopped making some of their crackers in the shape of a bunny, and have changed the names & packaging of these products to reflect this, as of July 2014 Amazon has not changed the names of the products sold on this page. This may cause consumers to be confused about which products they're buying, or what they'll get. The list below may be helpful.\n\nAnnie's makes many different kinds of crackers & cookies. Most of them use to be bunny shaped, some are organic while others are not, many have similar names. To help you understand the different cracker & cookie flavors and shapes, here is the breakdown of what is being offered on this page, as of August 3, 2014. There are four different crackers:\n\nAnnie's Homegrown Organic Saltine Classics (hexagon shaped)\nAmazon title: Annie's Homegrown Organic Bunny Classic Crackers Saltines\n\nAnnie's Homegrown Organic Cheddar Classics (hexagon shaped)\nAmazon title: Annie's Homegrown Organic Bunny Classic Crackers Buttery Rich\n\nAnnie's Homegrown Organic Buttery Rich Classics (hexagon shaped)\nAmazon title: Annie's Homegrown Organic Bunny Classic Crackers Cheddar\n\nAnnie's Homegrown Organic Cheddar Bunnies (bunny shaped)\nAmazon title: Annie's Homegrown Organic Cheddar Bunnies\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nMAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING THE RIGHT PRODUCT:\nBecause you might be looking for a cracker or cookie that's not listed above, and you may be wondering if the cracker or cookie you want is still made or discontinued, I thought it might be helpful to list what Annie's currently makes, with a notation as to which ones are currently being sold on this page (as of August 3, 2014).

I don't have to buy it to know PLASTIC IS TOXIC. I don't know why they changed it (use to come in glass) but I'm moving to another brand if they don't go back to glass jars. Again, plastic is toxic, and they should know this. Storing an organic product long term in a plastic jar is ridiculous! How something tastes is not the only mark of the item's quality - how it's made and how it's stored, if it is stored in toxic plastic, makes a difference and that's why I give this product 3 stars instead of the 5 stars I give to Woodstock in glass jars. They're doing this for cost savings, because it costs less to ship, but that savings is surely not passed on to consumers. And even if it were, I would not want to eat peanut butter stored in toxic plastic. They're lucky I'm giving it 3 stars.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSanta Cruz Organic, 100% Lemon Juice, 16 Ounces\nReview:\nI like the taste - tastes very close to fresh squeezed lemon juice and has a stronger flavor than the juice found in squeeze bottles. It can be used to make great tasting lemonade (don't forget to add sugar), but I prefer to mix it with grape juice (or other juices and juice blends) for a concoction that helps to relieve kidney stones. If you use it for this reason you should take 2-4 ounces a day. And yes, it helps relieve very painful kidney stones. I also love that it's organic.\n\nI've used Santa Cruz brand and Sicilia squeeze bottle. Santa Cruz brand is best for making the freshest tasting lemonade or punch, but Sicilia is best if you want to always have some on hand (and don't have room in the fridge), or if you need just a little squeeze on fish now and then, and for traveling (Sicilia does not need refrigeration until it's opened): Sicilia&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Organic-Lemon-Juice-4-oz/dp/B00E3K182M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Organic Lemon Juice, 4 oz</a>\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I have always found instant oatmeal in the little packs to not have good flavor despite all the additives and I always want to add more sugar to make it taste better. This was not the case with this oatmeal!  I actually loved this oatmeal with out wanting to add sugar or flavoring to it.  I liked the cinnamon flavor and did not feel it was too much and did not feel it was too little.  Who knows how many grams of sugar I add to my plain oatmeal when I make it, I may be better of eating this instead, and the ingredient list was pretty darn clean too, nothing I would avoid.  I would definitely buy again and would RECOMMEND.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCAILLER L'Art du Brut, Dark Chocolate 54% Cocoa with whole Almonds &amp; Cranberries, 6.87 ounce bars (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nReview of the dark almond cranberry.\n\nMy two bars arrived in good condition, no melting or other issues.  The chocolate bar is very unique, expensive looking, and pleasing to the eye.\n\nFirst off I want to say that I am a dark person, that is why I wanted to try these bars so badly.  No where on any of the packaging does is it indicated the percentage of cocoa in this chocolate, it is only mentioned on the product page that it is 54%.  Also, I waited to write this review until my sample of the dark blueberry arrived so I had something to compare this to.\n\nThe price is about $17 for two bars with shipping costs included.  Each bar is nearly 7 ounces.  When compared to Green & Black's which is a bar I have bought in the past all too many times, the price is actually really similar when taking into account the cost of shipping being rolled into the price given that these Cailler bars are twice the weight of a Green & Black bar.\n\nCailler's dark chocolate is very rich and smooth and not at all bitter or chalky or hard or crunchy.  The texture and flavor, however, may be a result of the relatively low cocoa percentage compared to many other dark chocolates I am used to eating which are all above 65% and most 70% or above.  Research states that the health benefits of dark chocolate do not kick in until a certain threshold of cocoa content has been passed which Cailler's dark chocolate is no where near, so don't think you are doing your body good eating one ounce of this a day.\n\nI like almonds and the cranberries gave this a nice kick, the flavor really popped, like dark chocolate over an orange jelly.  I did feel, however, that because of the almonds and cranberry content that there was less chocolate in each bite than I'd have liked.\n\nI don't have a sweet tooth, I have a whole sweet mouth.  I can sit down and eat and entire Green & Black's bar in one sitting and barely bat an eyelash.  This bar seemed so rich to me that after four pieces (one row) I was able to put it down and walk away, even for the rest of the day.  This is nice for me because it means that this chocolate would last for me and that I won't over do it on this either.\n\nI also like that while Nestle may be the parent company now this chocolate is still actually made in Switzerland as it had been before Nestle.\n\nWould I buy this again?  Yes, but I might wait until I can find it in stores so that I am not paying a higher price because of shipping.\n\nSo, why not five stars?  Cost, not enough chocolate in each bite due to fruit and nut content, lower cocoa content than I'd like.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSalted White Truffle Grass-Fed Ghee Butter by 4th &amp; Heart, 9 Ounce,Pasture Raised, Non-GMO, Lactose Free, Certified Paleo, 9 oz\nReview:\nFirst I want to say that the only other ghee I have tried is Purity Farms.  Next, I only have used ghee for baking purposes, for making things the most flaky possible when making puff pastry and when working with phyllo dough as clarified butter, I think, really makes a difference.  For our regular butter that we keep in our butter dish we ALWAYS buy grass fed, we used to get Pastureland which is the best but that hasn't been available in over a year so we did a taste test between Kalona and Organic Valley and we now buy Kalona Supernatural.  Anyway, when I saw this sample pack by 4th & Heart I though what would I do with it all and what would I do with the different flavors.  Then I started thinking how the vanilla would be neat in pastries, and how the garlic could make easy garlic bread, the item description talked about just using it as a spread.  So, I tried it, and now I can't stop eating the stuff.\n\nI want to start with the fact that this is grass fed.  I attached a photo of the original 4th & Heart ghee next to my Purity Farms ghee and you can see the huge color difference, and no, there is no color added to the 4th & Heart, the deeper yellow comes from the cows having been grass fed.  Grass fed dairy is higher in many, many nutrients but most notable in my mind are conjugated linoleic acid and vitamin K2.  K2 is a big deal because it is hard to get natural unless you eat a lot of seaweed and it makes a huge difference in calcium being deposited where it should go, in bones, not in arteries.  CLA is good for maintaining muscle mass and metabolism and also helps keep cancer away.  Now, on to taste.\n\nOur first tasting was on 100% whole wheat bagels just as spread, everyone in the family tried all five flavors.  Since then we have been eating daily.\n\nOH MY GOD did just the plain unsalted original have amazing sting butter flavor, this stuff will spoil you.  Kids liked it too, husband loved how buttery it tasted.  Would definitely buy this again.\n\nWe eat pink Himalayan sea salt at home as our usual salt, so I thought it was great that this was what 4th & Heart uses.  The flavor of this ghee was also fantastic.  That being said, the amount of salt in this the is more than twice that of Kalona Supernatural grass-fed butter we usually eat.  But still, it tastes really good :)  Kids and hubby really liked this flavor as well.\n\nThe vanilla is delicious and the kids now ask for it at breakfast.  There is nothing but clarified butter and vanilla in this yet it seems to have a sweet taste to it, and it brings out the sweetness in in anything it is mixed with.  The kids now request this butter on their bagels, toast, and english muffins which we usually serve with a little maple sugar sprinkled on top and the mix of the vanilla with the maple sugar is wonderful, and because of the added sweetness of the vanilla ghee I can actually cut way back in the maple sugar I sprinkle and the kids don't notice or care.  I have not yet tried baking with this, we have been enjoying all the flavors so much as just plain spreads that I may never bake with it as we most likely will just eat it all as is.\n\nThe garlic smells so heavenly and intense, but the flavor was just not there, it was so odd to smell so much garlic and then taste next to none, I was disappointed thinking my grand plans of super fast and easy and delicious garlic bread using this stuff and ciabatta bread were dashed.  It took me a few times of using it to figure out that there was no salt added to the garlic and this might make a difference.  So, I tried adding a little of my own salt and voila, there was the garlic flavor I was looking for, just not as strong as it smells though.  I like this so much that I have been using the garlic with added salt on my bagels as a savory bagel instead of going with something sweet.  I have not yet tried garlic bread, but will be buying ciabatta in a few days when we next go grocery shopping.  My kids did not care for this one, no big surprise there for me, and my husband agreed with me that the smell was fantastic but that the garlic flavor was just not there.  he has not yet tried it with salt, but I am sure he'd agree with me that salt brought out the garlic flavor.\n\nI have never tried white truffle anything before though I have seen the oil around a lot lately.  This flavor ghee really did nothing for any of us, no one particularly cared for it but it certainly wasn't bad tasting though.  I told my mom about it and I swear she was salivating through the phone, so I may give her the rest of the jar and perhaps she will appreciate it more than my family.\n\nLastly, price.  This stuff is expensive.  The Purity Farms I bought at a natural food store and so did not have to pay for shipping, so I decided to see what it sells for on Amazon where shipping is included in the price to more fairly compare pricing and this 4th & Heart grass-fed ghee is about the same price per jar.  Purity Farms is organic but not grass fed, 4th & Heart is grass fed but not organic.  So, this may be why the pricing is so similar.  I can't help but wonder how much more affordable 4th & Heart would be if I were to find it in a store.  At an average of $14 per jar it is quite spendy to use every day as a spread, it is about 2.5 sticks per jar and Kalona Supernatural is about $8 or $9 for 4 sticks, though it is not clarified  just grass-fed and organic.  I would definitely buy this 4th & Heart regularly if I could find it at a store for less than what it sells for on Amazon, and I will still buy it once in a while on Amazon for a treat as both myself and the kids are really loving it, it is really so flavorful as compared to the other ghee I have tried and so much more flavorful than out usual stick butter.  But I think I would choose jars individually so that we get what we like the best and not have to pay for so so flavors.  I can see where this multi-flavor pack would make a totally awesome gift.  And I like how clarified butter has a much longer life span than regular butter, so this stuff doesn't have to be consumed so fast and will last a long while.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTasty Brand Organic Fruit Snacks, Mixed Fruit Flavors, 4 Ounces 5-Count Packages (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese are now our go to for fruit snacks.  Annie's changed their recipe and now contain 11 grams of sutra per serving instead of 10 and they are now sticky which makes for yucky fingers after eating them.  These fruits snacks are the lowest in sugar I can fins that are organic and contain no artificial colors or flairs or preservatives.  As a bonus, not that we need it but one on my daughter's friends is allergic, all Tasty products are produced in nut free facilities.  Very clean, very tasty, as the name says, and the kids love them of course, heck, me too for that matter.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeanut Butter &amp; Co. Chocmeister Hazelnut Spread, Milk Chocolatey, 13 Ounce Jar\nReview:\nI debated the star rating on this, 5 stars would be for taste alone, but despite the reduced sugar and extra protein the nutritionals on this still are not good, so a 4 star was the best I can do.\n\nI love hazelnuts, I love hazelnut butter.  It is actually really hard to find plain hazelnut butter.  When traveling I have found brands like Kettle, Futters, and another brand, the only of these still available is Futters, and no one in the Minneapolis/St Paul area carries it.  So, I had been making my own hazelnut butter using my Vitamix and it was delicious.  I never needed a chocolate hazelnut butter.  My kids and I have all tried Nutella at my mother's house and it is tasty, of course it is, sugar is the first ingredient, and it really tastes just like eating chocolate.  Not my thing, and I am surprised it is my mother's.  I was excited when Justin's came out with a chocolate hazelnut butter, the nutritionals are WAY better than any other chocolate hazelnut product out there, but it is isn't truly chocolate hazelnut because it is almond too, and it is dry and difficult to squeeze out of the little pouches or too dry to scoop out of the cup with the pretzels it comes with, and it just wasn't as tasty as I was hoping.\n\nNow, enter Chocmeister.  They are trying to compete with Nutella as is everyone.  In that vein this has sugar as the first ingredient and has oil added in the form of palm oil.  This being their dark chocolate version does not have any milk added.  Chocmeister says this has 50% more protein than Nutella and 25% less sugar, and this it does indeed.  However, if you really care about the nutritionals you'd choose their milk chocolate version instead because it has 4 grams of protein instead of 3 (Nutella has 2gr protein).  I like that with Chocmeister they use cane sugar instead of beet sugar, cane sugar is not GMO whereas all beet sugar (unless it is organic) is GMO.  I also think it is awesome that they use sunflower lecithin instead of soy as many people are trying to avoid soy for health reasons.  Also, Chocmeister uses natural vanilla instead of the artificial vanillin which has been linked to allergies and ADD like behavior in kids.  Interestingly Chocmeister has also opted to try to boost the fiber content of their product by adding chicory root, and who doesn't need more fiber, right?  I get the feeling that this company is really trying to do things right, or at least better.\n\nThe jar does not say to refrigerate after opening, so I did not, but it was cool (42 degrees) when I pulled it out of the mailbox and yes, I tried it right there in the car, didn't even wait to get home, and was not very spreadable at 42 degrees, but at room temperature is was more than spreadable.  I am looking forward to heating it up in the microwave and trying it as topping on sea salt carmel ice cream :)\n\nSo, on to flavor.  Chocolate is all I taste when I eat this, I don't taste any hazelnut butter.  I am sure there are plenty out there with whom this is fine.  My kids really liked this stuff too, of course, remember, sugar is the first ingredient.  I have to say I have always been a fan of dark chocolate over milk, my kids will tell you they prefer milk, but they didn't complain about this being dark.  If you want something to compare the flavor of this to, it is a lot like the \"cocoa fudge\" they use at Dairy Queen.  I have not tasted Chocmeister's milk chocolate version but I watched a Youtube blind taste test and folks could pick out the Nutella and said that Chocmeister's milk chocolate had more hazelnut flavor and less chocolate flavor in comparison.  So if you are trying to decide between the milk and dark Chocmeister keep that in mind.\n\nWhile I really like the taste of this, I have to say it seemed really rich, and I can't imagine eating two whole tablespoons of this as one serving, I think that is too much.  I think a single tablespoon is way more doable AND it cuts the sugar to 7.5 grams which is within the 9 gram limit we try to keep per serving on foods we buy (not including whole fruits and such).  One tablespoon is plenty for a whole slice of toast or both halves of an English muffin or half a bagel.\n\nNo one is eating this or any other chocolate hazelnut spread for the protein, they eat it for the chocolate, the hazelnut butter is just the spreadable medium the chocolate is suspended in.  So this, like any other chocolate hazelnut spread, is a treat, a dessert.  That being said the reduced sugar (and slightly elevated protein) in this is really a nice thing and makes the guilt factor a lot less.  If you are used to Nutella and love it you may not go for the taste of Chocmeister products, but if you are and you want to move to eating a little better make the switch and you'll get used to the taste of this and be happy.  If you are like me and have never bought Nutella because of how bad for you it is but want a little treat and not to feel that badly about about being bad, then Chocmeister is the way to go.  I can see, since I con't keep sweets in the house, that when those cravings hit I will go to this jar with a spoon and will be satisfied and will not feel as bad about it as other things I could eat, like sneaking my kids' halloween candy....\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nCAILLER Pralin&eacute; Chocolate Selection, Large Box Assortment, 7.8 Ounce, (25 Pieces)\nReview:\nI read a lot of the other reviews that said their chocolates arrived melted.  I counted myself quite lucky that mine arrived without melting despite having been shipped from Las Vegas to Minnesota, perhaps my luck has to do with it being the end of October.  While mine did not arrive melted there were still half a dozen pieces that were damaged in some way, sad when this chocolate tries so hard to make a nice and high end presentation with packaging and all.\n\nThis assortment is really quite diverse and I liked that, there were some types in the box I had not ever had before.  There were two of each kind which allowed me to eat one of each and let the rest of the family share the remaining pieces so I was able to make up my mind about these chocolates having tried it all.  The quality of the chocolate was really fabulous, this may have been my first time eating chocolate actually manufactured in Switzerland, it was so creamy, smooth, flavorful, and rich.  My husband and I are much more the dark sort but my daughters are both milk types, they just about died eating their allotment from this box they were in so much chocolate heaven.  I would definitely say that if you are the type to prefer dark then maybe this assortment is not for you.  If you love nuts then this is an amazing assortment.  My favorite nuts are hazelnuts and almonds and I definitely got my fill in this box that's for sure.  Very well done chocolate, very lovely presentation, would make for a real statement gift or a special treat/reward for yourself.\n\nThis is quite pricey, it comes out to about $70 per pound basically.  Anytime I see a product that has free shipping I know I have to remember that the price is inflated to cover the cost of shipping, I cannot help but wonder how much less expensive one might find this box in a store for, and perhaps with less to worry about in terms of damage or melting from shipping.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Chef's Naturals Walnut Halves &amp; Pieces, No Preservatives, Non-GMO, 16 oz\nReview:\nThese are great.  I got them because I like using them in a salad topper recipe (walnuts, chia seeds, almond slices, dried cranberries, dried apple when I have it, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, pecans when I have them).  I also like them in oatmeal and in plain yogurt both with raisins.  I also like adding them to banana bread.  But my favorite recipe for these is cherry chicken pasta.  However, when these arrived, they were opened and sampled and then my daughter sat at the computer just munching on them, so I guess these may not even make into a recipe they are that good.  I like the resealable package, that is a nice change from the nuts in the baking aisle at the grocery store.  I am kind of bothered that they are advertising non-GMO since there are no FDA approved GMO crops other than corn (non-sweet corn), soybeans, sugar beets, canola (rapeseed), and cotton.  So, all walnuts are non-GMO anyway, and since the ingredients are simply walnuts there again would be no need to push these as non-GMO.  I guess I like that Fisher's $ is going to the Non-GMO Project and that they support the labeling of GMO's.  Anyway, good tasty chopped walnuts, not sure about pricing, seems a little high, but then again shipping is included in that, so...\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I was told to stay on a low fiber/no meat diet for a while.  They suggested pasta and rice as a base.  When I saw this I thought...it's Barilla...how bad can it be.  It was pretty darn good with a little drizzle of quality olive oil and parm cheese sprinkled on top.  Now I can eat seafood and right away thought about this with sauteed shrimp and fresh garlic tossed in.  As usual, I checked for the product on Amazon and see they've got a 4 pack available through Subscribe and Save....my favorite way to shop.\n\nI'm looking forward to trying the shrimp dish. While the tortellini is cooking I'll quickly saute fresh shrimp and chopped fresh garlic in a little olive oil and a small pat of butter for rich flavor. Toss that into the cooked pasta and top with a little grated cheese.....yummy!!!!!  Can't wait to add veggies to this dish.  One bag serves 4 or, if you're a robust eater, provides 2 REALLY generous servings.

Alas it doesn't stand up to percolated coffee. I shook it well and added the 2 tablespoons to my coffee. I added more, stirred, more, stirred, more, stirred. I added a third of the 11 oz container and gave up. I still had to add regular half & half to get to a reasonable level of creaminess.\n\nI guess if you like your coffee weak and just a splash of cream it would work. However, it just doesn't stand up to espresso or percolator grinds.\n\nTaste was good (no noticeable aftertaste) but for the calorie load I'll stick with half & half. I can deal with the 40 calories of half & half much better than the higher calorie load it takes to lighten my coffee with Nutpods. I'll just use it on the weekends and maybe in some dinner rolls or baking recipes to use it up.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nStur - Classic Variety Pack, Natural Water Enhancer (5 Bottles, Makes 100 Flavored Waters) - Sugar Free, Zero Calories, Kosher, Keto Friendly Liquid Drink Mix Sweetened with Stevia\nReview:\nI am very happy so far.

I was not sent the exact description of the items as I did not get the Blue and Blackberry one, but a Black Tea with Lemon was subbed instead, so I am deducting a star for that.

This small bottle will go a long way because it is very strong. I \"powdered\" some over a pint of fruit salad (pineapple chunks, mandarin orange segements and freeze dried raspberries), and it perfectly corrects and balances the tartness and the sweetness, enhancing the flavor of the canned pineapples, especially,.\n\nIt is a softer stevia, and at the same time very concentrated, which is why I used the term \"powdered\".\n\nMy only objection is the plastic bottle, and as soon as I can I will put this in a glass bottle that fits the lid. I took away the fifth star for that. For flavoring though I give it five stars.

It's OKAY if cooked to softness in something like a strong tomato sauce or a spicy hungarian goulash. When I first opened the bag it did not pass the sniff test - musty smelling. Imagine eating a wet Triscuit cracker that has no salt or sugar or seasonings - that's what it's like if you undercook it. I'd rather purchase a bag of sprouted grain flour and make my own spaghetti noodles - I'm sure it would taste better.  I would not purchase this again and even though I really like noodles I prefer the zucchini noodles. I also like the Jovial brand classic white einkorn pasta but the phytic acid is still an issue with all grains and seeds products that have not been pre-germinated. The ancients knew this. There is a longstanding myth that the human body needs protein to break down into amino acids, whereas the body is perfectly able to create its own protein from amino acids in fresh fruits and vegetables. Nuts, seeds, grains should not need to be more than 10% of diet, and meats amd dairy even less --- I did not start to experience a restored youthfulness until I made ripe fruits and leafy greens 80% of my diet...doctor's orders.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nKing Soba Noodles Organic Sweet Potato and Buckwheat Noodles, 8.8 Ounce\nReview:\nGreat packaging, great product, and I've looked for and tried other sobas... most of them contain wheat as first ingredient.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGarden of Life Raw Organic Protein Unflavored Powder Packets, 10ct Tray - Certified Vegan, Gluten Free, Organic, Non-GMO, Plant Based Sugar Free Shake with Probiotics &amp; Enzymes, 4g BCAAs, 22g Protein\nReview:\nMy body did not jump up and down for joy with this product, and I'm not referring to the taste, smell, or texture.

The kind that comes with their macaroni and cheese dinners, and used to be available in containers. They vanished from stores years ago, and they used to sell it in small 3 oz shakers by the case here on Amazon, but that too has since disappeared.  Unfortunately grated cheddar is very expensive as compared to the standard Romano or Parmesan.  The Kraft was worth the extra cost for it was so delicious.  But the others I have tried have either been way to expensive, or weak and flavorless.  This Hoosier cheddar blend is not as strong nor as flavorful as the Kraft by any means in my opinion.  But it is still very good, and excellently priced.  Unlike many on here, I don't use it much on popcorn.  I love it on pasta especially, and when making my home made pizzas.  It is also very tasty in soups as well.  It is indeed unfortunate that the Kraft grated cheddar is not available anymore, but this is a very worthy alternative, especially for the price.  Not quite as good as Kraft, but still decent and recommended... : )\n\nPS:  At the time of this writing, the 1 1/2 pound size is a much better bargain over the one pound container.  It's just around $3.00 more and you get another half pound of product.  Also, I was originally sent a one pound container by mistake, but the seller allowed me to keep it and promptly sent me the correct larger size. : )\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBeef Broth Powder, 8 oz.\nReview:\nThis is excellent bullion at a bargain price.  Since its a powder you can much more easily make an accurate measurement of how much you want to add to your stock. And as a powder, it contains slightly less sodium than the familiar cubed bullion. A little of this powder goes a long ways for it is so rich.  So this 8 oz. package ends up being a bargain for it will last most of us through several winters. I highly recommend it.  It has helped me make the best vegetable beef soup in the United States.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nViva Naturals Organic Ghee 8 oz - from 100% Grass-Fed Cows, Non-GMO, and Certified Paleo Diet Friendly\nReview:\nThis stuff doesn't taste exactly like butter, or margarine, but it is close enough that it has a very pleasant, buttery like taste all its own...Though it states that it should be refrigerated after opening, enough reviewers here have taken note that it is not really a requirement....Thus this stuff stays rather soft and spreadable by remaining at room temperature..(But not as soft as butter or margarine that has sat at room temperature for a while). One thing about this stuff that is a nice advantage is its higher boiling point.  Spreading it out in a frying pan sees much less smoke and more substance that butter...A good asset for sure if you really like cooking with this.  Personally with its cost I did not find any real advantage to cooking with it as to taste in the finished product.. If you are really into this being a purer perhaps healthier alternative to butter, that would be a different matter.  But for myself I like it best as a spread for hot rolls, toast, cornbread, etc, all of which it tastes great on.  All in all some really good stuff...A little too costly for me to  use regularly, but a little of it goes a long ways which is a good thing...Recommended for those that are into this sort of thing and really do enjoy the rich taste...\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nChef Boyardee Overstuffed Italian Sausage Ravioli, 15 oz, 12 Pack\nReview:\nThis is undoubtedly the best canned ravioli I have ever tasted. And I am not usually a big fan of canned ravioli except for a quick lunch sort of thing. I just recently came across this variety in the market here and gave it a try.  Not only is the ravioli truly overstuffed, but the sausage they use is very tasty without being hot and spicy.  I have actually baked these with Parmesan cheese and some added garlic and onion for 15 min and had people rave about them being home made.  If you can't find this in your market, its a good deal here on Amazon by the case, and with free shipping.  Excellent home made flavor, and highly recommended... : )\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCheddar Cheese Powder, 1 lb. by Barry Farm\nReview:\nI am admittedly a big fan of Barry Farm products.  They make just about any food, veggie, dairy product, or spice in either a freeze dried or powdered form.  As an outdoor enthusiast that enjoys carrying along a little taste of home into the savage wilderness, this is a company that I am well familiar with.  Not everything they make is delicious, or worth it. My experience with them however is that most of their products are just about the finest, and many times the only ones around.  This cheddar cheese powder is definitely one of their best.  Many reviewers here mention making macaroni and cheese, and popcorn with it.  Although I have used it for those purposes like everyone else, I have also used this powder as an addition to many soups that call for cheese, or grated cheese. (It makes a very flavorful substitute for grated cheese in many recipes.) Hamburger and sausage soups are a good example.  Many times I have concocted delicious one pot meals using this powder while out in the wilds on a hike, or camping. They are remembered as some of the best meals I have ever had. It is also very good when sprinkled on home made pizza, and I have an excellent recipe that includes this powder, butter, flour, and salt, that makes a delicious cheese spread for crackers and super bowl parties. Barry Farms cheddar powder is strong and flavorful, and a little goes a long ways.  A one pound bag will get you through many a recipe and outdoor adventure.  However since the shipping on this is a little high, (and the powder so reasonable) I suggest buying two pounds or more at once and storing it in a good air tight container.  You will save a lot on the shipping, and this powder will last for months if stored correctly.  I highly recommend this cheddar powder for those that enjoy the simple pleasures of popcorn and mac and cheese, as well as the more adventurous among us in the kitchen, and over an open fire...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTomato Flakes, 2 oz.\nReview:\nI have used a pretty good size line of Barry Farms dehydrated veggies for more than a decade now.  Although I occasionally have used them when cooking in my kitchen, the vast majority of time I use them for campfire cooking when I am hiking.  I love carrying dried products such as this on my hikes for they are light, easy to carry, and you can just use what you want and reseal the bag.  (Unlike canned veggies and such that don't take kindly to being bagged and toted along as leftovers).  Best of all, these tomato flakes are very flavorful.  Make that downright delicious.  I add about a third of one bag to any stew or soup I am making on an open fire, and the rich taste of fresh tomato is your reward in every spoonful. A little of these flakes goes a long ways as to flavor, so keep that in mind if your a beginner with them.  They have a much fresher taste than you would imagine, and have been a part of some of the best meals I have ever put together in the wilderness.  My only recommendation when ordering these flakes is to get at least 3 bags at once to make the shipping worth it.  You can order 3 of them for the same shipping cost as one.  Really rich tasting and well worth your money in my opinion...\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKirkland Signature California granulated garlic, 18 oz\nReview:\nGarlic powder is like salt and pepper in this house...Never without it and never left out of a recipe...Although I have settled for cheaper brands, quality in the past, this has now become a staple in my home...You can really smell the freshness and strength of this upon opening, and definitely in the taste of whatever I am cooking...This is also superior to the McCormick California garlic which I have had and used before...Fresher and stronger, and even lasts longer...Garlic like any other spice can go bad, lose its pungency over time.

Locally, we can only get the Indian and Elderflower tonics, so when I read about the Mediterranean version, I searched online for it. I knew I would have to pay a premium because of shipping, but was willing to give it a go just for taste test purposes. We use tonic for gin and tonics, no other drinks really, other than little experiments here and there. Needless to say, this is a very good tonic, but not much different from the Indian. So long story short, if it were available locally I would totally purchase it in addition to the other Fever Tree tonics, but since it isn't and it wasn't any better, I won't. Still, if you are into cocktails and want to give it a go, you won't be disappointed, but it isn't critical.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Shredded Coconut (Unsweetened), 24-ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nClean, simple coconut.

I love chicory coffee---it has a stronger flavor but not bitter, and a bit less caffeine which is sometimes nice when I want a hot cuppa joe but not the buzz.\n\nWhere we live in the Northeast, we can get a more commercially well-known brand of chicory coffee, and while this brand is fine and well-marketed, it is not the only one made, by far. There are a lot of choices in Louisiana, and I have tried a bunch. But French Market is by far my fave, and the white can of Restaurant blend is overall the best.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHarissa Condiment In Tube - Spicy 120 Gr\nReview:\nUsed this harissa paste for a traditional Moroccan carrot dip, and it gave it just the right amount of peppery flavor.

Since that time, certain oils are available in my local grocery. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that they have been around a long time, and always with a focus on high quality and good health.\nCoconut oil has all but replaced my cooking oils, and most of the butter I use. To say nothing of being used on my hair and skin.\n\nIn the years I've been using it, it's become clear that not all coconut oil is the same.\nUnlike a few others, this one has no 'off' scent, it smells fresh and the coconut scent is mild enough to used in a wider variety of cooking applications, as opposed to the highly scented ones that are best in dishes where you want a prominent coconut flavor.\nNon GMO, which I really like.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nViva Naturals Organic Quinoa, 4 LB - 100% Royal Bolivian Whole Grain\nReview:\nAt first quinoa was treated like a flash-in-the-pan 'trendy' fad, but thankfully, it looks like it is here to stay.\nAnd with good reason.\nIf you're reading this, you're already familiar with the health benefits of this ancient grain.

I had a bunch of friends try both flavors and everyone agreed that the Cherry Coconut bar was amazing but this one was a disappointment.

If you aren't a coconut fan, you might skip these, but otherwise, I would highly recommend them instead of any of the sweeter bars on the market. The price is a little high so I'm hoping that will come down as these become more popular.\n\nI received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSvelte Organic Protein Shake, French Vanilla, 11 Ounce (Pack of 8)\nReview:\nThis is the only organic soy drink I can find on the market so I was very happy that it also tastes good.

Most protein drinks use very low grade proteins which aren't very healthful so its great to find one which is organic and dairy-free.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSahale Snacks Valdosta Pecans Glazed Mix, 4 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese are so delicious and convenient in these small packages.

Some of the reviewers post on here that its purposefully made that way to have a longer lasting flavor when used for baked or frozen goods. I'm not sure if thats true or not, but its not nearly as good or strong a vanilla as I'm used to using. Although this Vanilla is inexpensive and looks authentic, its not nearly as good as the 100% vanilla extracts I've used in the past, so, unfortunately, I'll have to go back to the more expensive brands.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nEmerald Cashews, Salt and Pepper, 1.25 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI purchased these at a local store and they were fabulous.

This tea has a very unpleasant taste, something I cannot quite describe.  I have to force myself to drink it until I use up my supply.  It sort of makes me shudder as I swallow it.  I have tried brewing it for shorter times and I still don't like it.  I have also tried the Decaf White Tea, with the same opinion.\n\nIt was surprising to me that I dislike this white tea.  I love other Good Earth tea products, with the decaf green tea and organic decaf green tea with mango being my favorites that I drink daily.\n\nI know the other reviewers have rated this white tea highly, but I would suggest trying a box from your local grocery before ordering in bulk.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nTraditional Medicinals Organic Throat Coat Seasonal Tea, 16 Tea Bags&nbsp;(Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis tea sampler is a must for cold and flu season.  I like to have this variety of teas on hand, and pick one most appropriate for how I am feeling \"under the weather\".  The box contains 4 sachets of 4 kinds: Throat Coat, Echinacea Plus, Breathe Easy and Gypsy Cold Care.  My favorite is the Breathe Easy which really helps to clear up clogged sinuses.  Be aware that the echinacea- or other flower-based kinds might affect people who have allergies to certain flowers, this may also depend on how long they are brewed.  Note that it is recommended to brew these teas for 10 to 15 min.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nGood Earth Herbal Tea, Sweet &amp; Spicy, Caffeine Free, 18 Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6) (Packaging May Vary)\nReview:\nI have been drinking Good Earth Decaf Green Tea for many years and it is my favorite tea. This tea is not purely green tea leaves - it also contains lemongrass and other flavors. It is flavorful but mild. Ingredients: Decaffeinated Green Tea, Lemongrass, Natural Flavors (Contains Soy Lecithin), Rose Petals and Peppermint.\n\nBe aware that the Good Earth Decaf Green Tea does not have the more delicate flavor as real Japanese green tea (and not a roasted flavor like Genmai), but it is great as an everyday tea. If you are expecting green tea like in Japanese restaurants, this is not it - if you want that, get high quality loose tea leaves and brew it with the correct temperature water in a teapot. (Although maybe the Good Earth green tea would taste more similar to Japanese green tea if brewed like Japanese green tea should be - read on...)\n\nI often leave my tea bag steeping for a long time (I know, not recommended for green tea, but it likely does extract more of the beneficial antioxidants), up to 30 min, and this tea does not get bitter. It also does not get bitter if the tea sits around before drinking. One Good Earth tea bag works fine for my large 16 oz mug. I have found that other brands of tea can be weak and not flavorful if using only one bag for 16 oz water.\n\nI also like that this tea is decaf since even the smaller amount of caffeine in green tea affects me. Decaf green teas are somewhat hard to find. This company uses a CO2 process for decaffeination, preferable to a solvent extraction process.\n\nNote that this product is available in 18-count and 25-count boxes.\n\nI have tried many other brands of green tea (decaf and regular) over the years and keep coming back to Good Earth brand. Highly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Kashi, Breakfast Cereal, Organic Autumn Wheat, Non-GMO Project Verified, 16.3 oz(Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is one of my favorite cereals that I always try to have on hand.  It is very lightly sweetened throughout (not frosted), has a great taste and good fiber content of 6g per serving.  I tend to avoid any sweetened cereals but I like the light amount of sweetness in this cereal.  I prefer this version over the Kashi Cinnamon Harvest, which was still excellent but a little too \"cinnamony\" for me.\n\nThis Kashi cereal is organic and is a great option compared to the standard brands for shredded wheat and frosted mini wheat cereals.  It tastes better than plain shredded wheat.  It is a healthier option with 7 g sugars compared to 12 g sugars in frosted mini wheats and those contain ingredients I am trying to avoid like high fructose corn syrup and gelatin.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeacock Brown Rice Vermicelli, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI am always looking for healthier, whole grain versions of foods I enjoy.  Unfortunately, these Peacock brand noodles are yet another food masquerading as healthy.  The product title in big letters on the front says \"Brown Rice Vermicelli\", making the consumer think \"this is made with brown rice, so it should be a healthy choice\".  But the first indication that it is not is when looking at the fiber content on the nutrition facts - only 0.6g per 2oz serving.  Then onto the ingredients list to see why so low... contains brown rice, sago starch and water.  The sago starch comes from palms and must not have much (if any) fiber.\n\nThe Annie Chun's Maifun Brown Rice Noodles (sold on Amazon and in my local healthy grocer) has become one of my staples and is my frame of reference when comparing to the Peacock brand.  The Annie Chun's product is made with 100% whole grain, with ingredients brown rice flour and water.  Per 2oz serving, it has 4g fiber and pretty much the same calories and other nutrients as the Peacock brand.\n\nIf you do try this Peacock brand noodles and have not used rice noodles before, you will need to seek guidance elsewhere on preparation.  As others have pointed out, the Peacock package gives almost no directions on how to prepare the product, aside from a brief mention in the recipes (in the header text it does say that they are \"easy-to-cook\" but does not say how).  It also contains a very strange recipe for rice noodles: Aglio Olio style - this is an Italian recipe for noodles with olive oil/garlic/sprinkled with grated cheese that I think would not be very tasty.  The second recipe appears to be for a soup with veggie strips.  Neither recipe gives amounts or much direction.  In comparison, the Annie Chun's package gives clear, specific directions on rice noodle preparation and two recipes.\n\nI use rice noodles = maifun = rice sticks = sometimes called vermicelli for making the Vietnamese salad \"bun tofu\", to serve with stir-fried veggies or in lettuce rolls.  They can also be used in spring rolls/egg rolls.  When cooking with thin rice noodles, be careful not to oversoak/overcook/overmix or they tend to disintegrate.  Asian rice noodle vermicelli (maifun) are not the same as Italian vermicelli and are not readily interchangeable.  If making an Italian recipe, the best results would be expected from Italian pasta and not maifun.\n\nA few final notes...  Both Peacock and Annie Chun's brown rice noodles are gluten free.  The Peacock is made in Singapore and the Annie Chun's in Thailand.  The Peacock noodles do taste fine (kind of bland), but so do the Annie Chun's.  At this time, they are both approximately the same price.  Peacock come in an plastic bag with some noodle crushage upon shipping; Annie Chun's are perfect upon removal from their cellophane bag in a box.  Overall, I highly recommend the Annie Chun's Maifun as a healthier option over the Peacock brand.  On a related note, the Annie Chun's soba and brown rice pad thai noodles are also excellent.\n\nRating for this product: 2.5 stars rounded down to 2 stars.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nGaia Herbs Sleep and Relax Herbal Tea Bags, 16 Count\nReview:\nI am a regular tea/herbal tea drinker and have tried lots of brands and types of tea, including may of the Sleepytime-type before bed teas.  Those tend to be comforting and relaxing but have not made me sleepy.  I was surprised that this Gaia Sleep & Relax tea actually worked to make me sleepy and relaxed within about 15 to 30min.  Thus, I would not drink other than right before bed because it did make me sleepy.  It has a good flavor; I tend to let the teabag steep for a long time and this did not result in bitter or unpleasant flavor.  I assume that letting it steep may result in more of the sleep-inducing herbs to come into the hot water.  The box says to let steep 10min and to drink 1 hour before bed.  This is the second Gaia product I have tried and I have been impressed with the quality.  Although not prominent on the front of the package, this product is certified organic.  Good value for the 20 tea bags.  Definitely recommend.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nAnnie Chun's Soba Noodles, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI agree with the 5-star reviews for this product.  These noodles are excellent tasting, have a good texture and cook up very quickly (4 to 5 min in boiling water).  I have not really bought many soba noodles in the past, so I'm not sure how these US-made noodles compare to authentic Asian soba.\n\nIt is easy to saute some veggies and make a quick sauce (or use a purchased sauce), for a weeknight meal.  I often cook the whole box then divide in half, making 1/2 as a hot stir-fry dinner and then save the other 1/2 (plain noodles) to use the next day.  I put the left-over noodles in the microwave for a brief time (just to bring them to room temp) then assemble the salad.  Amazingly, the noodles taste fresh and good the next day, possibly better tasting than freshly cooked.  I'm sure they would make a great noodle soup, although I have not tried yet.\n\nIngredients are unbleached enriched wheat flour, buckwheat flour, water, egg whites, salt.  They seem pretty healthy and have a decent amount of fiber, although they are probably not as healthy as a 100% whole wheat pasta, for example.  For the 12 oz box, 6 servings/box, amounts per serving: 200 cal (10 from fat), 3g fiber, 390mg sodium, 8g protein, 10% iron.  Also, great price from Amazon.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

True maple flavor and not a sickening sweet taste like some cookies.\n\nOnly (1) grocery store in our area carried these, and when I went back, they were out of stock, so I was thrilled to see the 12-box case on Amazon.

I've heard of it but have never given it any thought until now. What I didn't understand is that though it's butter, it is clarified butter and therefore has a higher smoke point than just regular butter. This has the same great taste as butter, even richer I think, but is good for high temperature cooking. I used it tonight on my  oven-baked fresh cut fries and it worked wonderfully and made the best tasting fries I've ever had. I think this will be a product in my kitchen from now on.

Packed full of natural and healthy ingredients, it's more than just a snack, it can be a meal. I like to have these around when I'm busy working and don't have time to stop for lunch, this is a great alternative to cooking something when time is short. At 230 calories (for the cherrylicious) it will give me the energy that I need to get through the afternoon and will fill me up without busting my calorie goal for the day.\nI am always looking for natural foods that I can feel good about feeding my family. The ingredients  in these bars are all names that I can pronounce and that I recognize, many of which are in my own cupboard. I also believe the fewer ingredients, the better for you.\nThe price is similar to high-end bars that I see on my weekly grocery trip.\nThese pass every standard that I have for pre-made food and I recommend them highly. If you travel a lot and need healthy food to eat on-the-go then I recommend these.

I only had to correct the salt. You can just sprinkle it or make a paste with water or olive oil for a rub.\n\nIt tastes very fresh and of course had a good seal when it arrived. It has already been assigned a place in the refrigerator in order to keep it fresh as long as possible. Well, not sure its life expectancy is ALL that long cuz it tastes really good!\n\nThe label says it contains organic paprika, organic caraway, organic crushed red chili pepper, organic cayenne, organic coriander, organic cumin, organic garlic, organic peppermint and sea salt. I don't think sea salt can be organic. I'd rather they didn't put that in as our oceans are so polluted and sometimes I've seemed to react badly to it, like an allergy.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nProgresso Soup, Traditional, Homestyle Chicken Soup, 19 oz Cans (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThis review is for the Chicken and Wild Rice that the can describes as \"savory\". Which it is. There never is a lot of chicken in any canned soup and I suppose the consumer doesn't expect it. But there IS some and obviously rice including wild rice and vegetables. There are three things I particularly like which are that it is gluten free, the vegetables do not overwhelm the rest of the ingredients and the stock is in fact particularly savory.\n\nI've never quite gotten over an ad campaign Progresso mounted in which they mocked and targeted their competitor, Campbell soups. It seemed to be the work of the worst kind of bully. I spoke to both companies about it. It put me off Progresso products for some time but I happened to come into the possession of this soup and did find it very good.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSenseo Dark Roast Coffee Pods, 4.41 Ounce, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nHere's the thing: the one-cup Senseo coffeemakers for which this pod is designed have proved unreliable. I wouldn't buy any more of them. But these pods are fabulous.\n\nI got these nearly two years ago for my Senseo pod coffeemaker that lasted for all of 30 uses. Junk, crap. But these pods have proved the opposite. They have outstanding flavor, even when they ought to be stale. Usually I have brewed coffee but when I run out and it doesn't make sense to make another pot, I put fresh water in a cup, add one of these and heat it in the microwave. Presto! A cup of java to which I add my 1% milk and enjoy. I am simply amazed that I can get such a good cuppa from a non-refrigerated, long-opened package, coffee pod!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSenseo Dark Roast Coffee Pods, 4.41 Ounce, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI have been most impressed with both my super-fast Senseo single-serve and its coffee pods. But no, the coffee does not taste as good as that I freshly grind. I realize that is an option if I want to produce my own pods but that would defeat the undeniable convenience of the single-serve machine. The coffee produced by this pod arrangement is happily strong - with this Dark Roast; I haven't yet tried any others - and the crema is wonderful, over and over. I do pre-wet the pods before brewing. I guess I could also wet down the machine parts. And I do heat non-fat or 1% milk in the microwave, then brew directly into that cup. This procedure mixes moo and joe quite adequately.\n\nThere is some aspect to the taste of the brew that does not please me - not sure I can put it into words well. I think it is partly due to the inevitable not-entirely-freshness of the pods. In addition there is some kind of harshness that seems intended to masquerade as richness. Duh? Maybe someone more knowledgeable about coffee prep can identify it better. I do not see anywhere on the package that these coffee pods are 100% Arabica. Could that be it? But for the convenience and cost, I cannot complain TOO much. I am really happy with the purchases.\n\nWant to say a word of thanks to other reviewers who have made helpful suggestions and observations. Here's one I've found through experimentation: There is still strength left in the pod after one brewing. I've started re-using them. The method depends upon my coffee needs at the moment. Sometimes I install the 2-cup holder in the machine and re-use one with a new one. Then I end up with two used ones, and darned if they don't have another use in them. Maybe you won't like this but it is an option to try if you wish. (By comparison, I've found there is absolutely no value in the used grounds after I've brewed a pot of drip.) By the way, the used pods still produce a fine crema; whether this is due to the pods or the well-designed machine I do not know.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nFire Cider, Apple Cider Vinegar Tonic with Honey, Original Flavor, Natural Detox, Pure &amp; Raw, Certified Organic Ingredients, Ideal for Cleansing Diet, No Heat Processed, 16 Shots, 8 oz.\nReview:\nIn order to obtain a trademark for Fire Cider, these people had to pretend that it was not already in common usage. All you have to do to discover that it has been used and shared for years, particularly by herbalist leader Rosemary Gladstar - and specifically called Fire Cider - is to Google it. Please do. Even if by some weird coincidence, they HAD happened to come up with both a strikingly similar formula and exact name, they could only obtain a trademark (which they have!) via false search results. Even if it weren't illegal, this is such a betrayal of trust, such a dishonorable act, that these Shire City \"business\" people deserve zero respect. The obvious lack of morals in claiming to have originated this, calls into question their credibility in every other aspect. Do they think they can corner the market by legally preventing anyone else from making for sale, a recipe that was developed by someone else before they were born? They seem to claim they won't do that, but as I said, they have already destroyed their credibility.\n\nHere's their less-than-honorable attempted enforcement of this shabbily-obtained trademark. After claiming on an Internet site that their trademark was needed to protect the product from the large food corporations, they stated that they had no intention of keeping others from using fire cider as they had been prior to the trademark. On their Wordpress blog, they state, \"We are not interested in suing anyone, especially herbalists working outside of the commercial marketplace.\" Right. Forcing others to discontinue selling long-held products via a well-known auction site is not the same as bringing a lawsuit. Go find them. Their blog is entitled \"firecider\" and as I said, it is at Wordpress. (Also search Fire Cider for their Facebook page.) You'll find their blog explanation cleverly worded but if you know the turf, very slippery. What happened, according to herbalist friends, is that they then proceeded to cause Etsy, the artsy Internet auction site, to stop other retailers from offering fire cider there. Do you need any more proof?\n\nBefore I knew of the problem these people have created, I bought some of the product locally and it was so-so - a friend a few blocks away makes some that is far better. Thing is, if people will claim ownership of a commonly-held recipe and name for profit, in what way will they alter their products for more profit?\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nFini Balsamic Glaze, 8.45 Ounce Bottles\nReview:\nLuckily found this at the supermarket but not a great deal cheaper. I enjoy balsamic vinegar and also the art of cooking, so a product that is condensed balsamic vinegar was something I just had to try. Naturally, I had to research it first. Turns out a lot of brands add a lot of extra ingredients; that I didn't want. This has just \"Balsamic vinegar of Modena ('aceto balsamico di Modena I.G.P.') 90%, (concentrated cooked grape must, wine vinegar, caramel color), glucose syrup, modified corn starch. Yes, it is sweeter than just plain balsamic. It makes such an elegant dollop, say on roasted pork with which it pairs well.\n\nIn addition to having a wonderful taste, I like the way the container is designed. It will stand up on either end, taking up less room in the fridge and promising utility when I have to get that last remaining amount to the business end. Speaking of the business end, I am delighted to find an unusually well-designed dispenser which allows me to put a dollop or smear exactly where I want it and when done, there is no mess. I mean the outside of the dispenser is totally clean after dispensing.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTrue Orange Shaker, Ginger, 2.82 Ounce\nReview:\nAnother great flavor burst from True Citrus Co, made in the USA and containing only crystallized orange [citric acid, orange oil, orange juice], ginger, maltodextrin, natural flavor. Contains soy. No preservatives. Gluten free. I keep it in the refrigerator and use it to instantly transport my simple meals to International Flavor City.\n\nThe orange flavor is very definite. The ginger is less so but its tart tang adds to the orange. I am accustomed to buying gingerroot and paring and mincing just before consumption; it is unlikely a dried version can replicatehat flavor. At any rate, I am more than happy with these products, their convenience and purity.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I'm not typically a flavored coffee person, but I thought this might be fun to try for iced coffee.  I tried today hot for a pick-me-up after finally being home from a long 4 days of business meetings and travel when my rear was dragging.  I'd give it a really good for someone who doesn't normally drink flavored coffee.  It's quite smooth and seems to be high quality coffee.

Based on a few reviews, I wasn't sure I would like it so I picked up a small box locally.  And I can report that indeed I do not like it...I LOVE it!  It has a light cinnamon flavor and an almost buttery finish.  I do add coconut cream and vanilla bean ghee to my coffee, so perhaps this is part of it, but this tastes like a liquid cinnamon roll.  I will be ordering for sure...this is one I can--and will--drink every day.  Absolutely delicious...so smooth, too.  I am not normally a flavored coffee person, but this is wonderful coffee, and I highly recommend it.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLaughing Man Colombia Huila Coffee Keurig K-Cups, 16 Count\nReview:\nI find this to be a very smooth, light coffee.

It's become a regular order for me.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nnutpods Dairy-Free Coffee Creamer, Unsweetened French Vanilla, 4-Pack\nReview:\nI haven't tried this in coffee yet, but I love it in tea.  I received this order at the same time I received by Republic of Tea order.  Coincidence?  I think not.  This is a stellar addition to the cup of Cardamom Creme Brulee tea I'm enjoying as I write this review.\n\nIt's not cream, don't expect the same texture especially as this product doesn't contain the typical thickeners usually found in products like this.  But the taste is excellent (nutty and slightly sweet with a creamy vanilla finish), and I experienced no issues at all with curdling when I added to the tea.  The amounts are pretty true to cream for me;  if I add cream to my team, it's usually about a teaspoon, and the same amount of nutpods worked well for me.\n\nIf you would like to avoid dairy and like the taste of nut milk, I think you'll be pleased with this product.  I would (and will) be buying this again.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nThe Republic of Tea, Bing Cherry Black Tea (Harry &amp; David), 50 Count\nReview:\nI just received this tea this morning and am drinking a cup as I write this.

Republic of Tea continues to deliver quality tea.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nThe Republic Of Tea Republic Red Chai Red Rooibos Herbal Tea, 36 Tea Bag Tin\nReview:\nThe only thing that keeps this tea from getting 5 stars is the fact that I've tried the loose leaf Mate Latte, and it's definitely better.  This one is really good, but the loose leaf is outstanding.  If you don't want to bother with loose leaf, I highly recommend this, however.  It's very tasty.  The vanilla, chocolate, and almond flavors are very smooth, and they work very well together.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nThe Republic Of Tea Organic Peppermint Bark Herb Tea, 36 Tea Bags, Fusion Of Cocoa And Peppermint Tea\nReview:\nI received a sample of this in an ROT catalog today.  I tried it this afternoon, and it's so good, I immediately ordered a tin.  Now for you to understand how significant this is for me, I do not normally care for peppermint and pass up almost everything that has peppermint in it.  I won't even use peppermint toothpaste.  But this was so smooth, and with the cocoa and vanilla everything melded together perfectly.  I added a spoonful of coconut cream (a standard practice for me on both coffee and tea), and it was heavenly.  I love this tea.  I did brew this with a smaller amount of water as I like strong tea, and I think 2 bags per 8 oz of water will be perfect.  I can't wait to get it!  :)\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

They are also VERY small.  Apparently, Fiber One made the portion size with keeping under 100 calories in mind.  I was seriously surprised at the tiny size. But, you have to keep your focus on the fiber so you don't kick yourself for such a tiny bar. They do have a lot of sugars in them, mainly from the lemon flavored frosting squiggles. Not sure if they had to add so much sweetness to cover the taste of the inulin (chickory root), the fiber they use or what, but at this point, I don't mind.  Thanks to dental troubles, I can't chew as well as I used to, so getting fiber is a challenge. (Sorry, I just can't down a glass of Benefiber, even though I know it isn't supposed to be gritty!

I was a little puzzled about the combination of marmalade and Champagne.  But, I trust Mrs. Bridges, and can happily report that this is a wonderful product.

Well done.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMrs Bridges Scottish Preserve, Strawberry, 12 Ounce\nReview:\nMrs. Bridges products are simply the best jams, preserves and marmalades.

I am used to the Yorkshire Tea in a slightly larger bags that do not have a tag or string.

This I wouldn't mind but I have a hard time digesting \"glass noodles\" and unfortunately I get the same queasy feeling eating the shirataki noodles. At first I thought it was that I'd eaten the whole package (in my favorite spicy broth) but I tried it again with marinara (not bad flavor-wise) then again in broth but half the amount of noodles and got the same queasy feeling. Too bad as this was an excellent idea.

My experience with the Tinyada noodles has me a little anxious about cooking time as they have a tendency to go from uncooked to mushy quite quickly - these seem quite a bit more forgiving.\nI tossed my first batch with Golden Mountain sauce, a lot of garlic and fresh thai basil and it was awesome.

I left home, and did not really bother to make beans for years and years, then one day I experienced an incredible urge for a pot of Pinto Beans. I bought some at the grocery store, but they were tiny, not the right color, and their taste was dull, without any of the rich gravy that I had come to expect from every batch of Pinto Beans that I had ever had in my life.\n\nSo, I turned to good old Amazon, certain that Ammy would have more Pinto Beans than even the most ardent lover of beans could ever imagine. I was right, it took me an hour to go through all of the various Pinto Beans on offer, and I had to make a few tough decisions.. In the end, I opted for Bob's Red Mill Pinto Beans. While they are not organic ( my preference), they are non-GMO, and are thick, plump, lightly-speckled beans, just the type that I grew up with.\n\nI ordered a big , old- fashioned Southern ham from a smokehouse in the Deep South, boned it out, cut up the bones, chopped about a quart of the ham into cubes, and was ready to go. First, I washed the beans and soaked them overnight in cold water, in a pan covered with a cloth, at room temperature. The next day, I drained the old water and added enough fresh water to cover about 2 inches above the beans, I added about four pieces of ham bone, four cups of cubed ham, two chopped bell peppers, 1 chopped onion, 2 bay keaves, a tea strainer full of about one tablespoon of whole black peppercorns, and two cans of original flavor Rotel Sauce. I brought this mixture to a boil, turned the beans way down low to simmer, and left them, barely bubbling, on the stove for about 5 hours. I stirred them infrequently, just to make sure that they weren't 'sticking on the. bottom of the pan.\n\nI made a batch of long- grain brown rice in my rice maker, and we each had a soup bowl filled with rice, and topped by these luscious , flavorful, and delicious beans with a thick rich gravy. They were so good that even my Yankee husband went back for seconds. These pinto beans are the best that I have ever eaten. They were a whole new taste experience for me, each bean was plump, juicy, and full of its own rich flavor, not to mention the flavor of the ham which had permeated the entire pot of beans with its own hickory-smoked flavor.\n\nThese are without a doubt the best Pinto Beans that I have ever tasted. They were clean, pale cream in color with the classic pinto dark markings. They had a very sweet taste, which was clean and pure, and they  soaked-up the ham and other seasonings as well. These beans are really expensive, my Southern ancestors must be turning in their graves over the price that  I paid ! However, I do not eat them every day, and they are the only beans that I have ever found that taste as good as the  beans that I grew-up with. You can serve them over brown rice, or you can make a nice batch of cornbread made with stone-ground corn meal and buttermilk., and use that to sop-up the yummy gravy.. Again - these beans are so expensive, but they are the only beans that I have ever found that taste like the beans from my childhood.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Extra Thick Rolled Oats, 32 Ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI live on Smoothies. One of the many, many ingredients is oats. I like thick,hunky, seriously \"Oatey\" oats.these fill the bill. Like all \"Bob's Red Mill organic\" items, the quality is just superb.\n\nThe have a fresh, rich, oat fragrance, and are the trickiest cut that I have been able to find. I have 26!noz. smoothie cups. These are serious Smoothies that I am making, and I live on them. I add 1/4 cup oats to each cup (approx), along with about 1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon to bring out, and accentuate the flavor.. I put them in the cup, and mix them into the Smoothie,not wanting to run them through the blender, and  totally defeating the purpose of my lovely fby chopping them up all tiny again.\n\nThey are about as pure and additive-free as can be found. The flavor and quality is just like candy to me ( I lack a sweet-tooth.), and really read and consider the nutritional level of this oat, I should be blasting off to the  moon some day,  under my own steam some day soon.\n\nI highly recommend these. I double bag themin Zip-Loxks, and freeze them. They stay nice and fresh, and their vitamins and nutrients are unaffected by the heat of a warm kitchen. If you can, try these. The nutrition that is added to your system, plus the luscious taste, makes these oats worth the effort.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill, Organic Medium Grind Cornmeal, 24 oz\nReview:\nI grew up eating cornbread, not the kind made with finely ground meal, white flour, sugar, and other non-Southern affectations. No, my family made the real thing : Stone Ground Coarse Yellow Corn Meal ( Personally fetched from the mill.), buttermilk, eggs, baking soda, salt, and bacon drippings. A large cast iron skillet was heated in the oven, with a spoonful of bacons drippings, until smoking hot, then the batter was poured into the pan. The pan was so hot, that the bottom and sides of the batter immediately fried and climbed the sides of the pan. This pan by the way, was a sacred object in our kitchen, it was never to be washed with soap and water, never scrubbed, and only Mother was allowed to use it. When the cornbread was baked, she would grab the hot pads and flip the heavy, cast iron pan over onto a plate. The cornbread came sliding smoothly put of the pan, exhibiting a golden, crispy, and yummy crust. Mother then wiped the hot pan out with a paper towel, and left it on the stove to cool down, that was it. Generations of Southern women seasoned these precious pans and passed them down to a lucky daughter.\n\nThe corn bread was yummy, tart and rich from the buttermilk, crispy on the outside, smelling of bacon, and crumbly and speckle-colored on the inside. This freshly ground corn meal was not solid yellow, it had various colors of specks in it, including black specks. Since it had just been ground, this was not mold or dirt, that was just what stone-ground corn meal looked like. I grew-up, left home, and forgot about cornbread for many years. But then the urge for it returned, I purchased my own cast-iron skillet and began a search for corn meal. I could not find any coarsely ground, stone ground corn meal that even remotely resembled what I grew up with until I tried this meal from Bob's. What a relief, the grind is just right, the meal is coarse and full of  differently colored specks, just exactly like what I grew up with. The corn bread that I produced was perfect, just as Mother would have made it. This meal is really expensive, my female Southern ancestors must be turning in their graves over what I paid for this. But......it is authentic, and just exactly what was needed to produce a real old-fashioned Southern cornbread.\n\n* Always store this in the freezer, it will go rancid very quickly otherwise.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBaja Bob's Maui Madness Mai Tai Mix, Sugar Free, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI ordered a case of this product, not expecting much in the way of taste, but at least it would be a low- calorie way to enjoy a Margarita. Amazingly enough  - this is an excellent mixer,  it tastes as if it has been made with fresh limes, and the artificial sweetener does not give the mix an odd taste. I just followed the instructions on the bottle, 3 parts mix to one part of Tequila. I added nothing additional, and served the drink with crushed ice. It has a light and refreshing taste, a recommended way to enjoy a nice Margarita, without an overload of calories.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nCarr's Whole Wheat Crackers, 7-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nThese are the most lovely biscuits that I have had to good fortune to discover -  rich and whole-wheat flavored, and that extra \" Highlands Butter taste. These have a womderfully fine crumb, the aroma wafting from these must be eaten, or enjoyed, with a fine Cappuccino..\n\nThey have a lovely golden  color, and one can easily eat three or four of these, without recognizing that fact. These must be carefully packed, and well-padded, if their wonderful flavor and  good taste is to be enjoyed whole. Just set a few out on a plate, and watch them disappear.\n\nI have eaten so many of these over the years, we used to get  them only during the holiday season.  My entire family is addicted, and If you like  nothing betterr than a lovely,  crumb texture, and a rich golden crumb, these are for you.\n\nThey are worth the occasional splurge-out for a truly super Scottish Cookie.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nWalkers Shortbread Animal Shapes, 6.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese chocolate shortbread cookies are extremely cute. The idea of baking Scottish Shortbread into the shape of a Scittie dog was a good one. They are just so cute, you really do not want to eat them. I gave several boxes to friends with little dogs that resemble the cookie dog. They all laughed and enjoyed the cookies.\n\nWalker's Shortbread is an old, well-established, and top-quality of Scottish shortbread. Normally it projects an intense buttery aroma, and is light, flaky, and crumbly. Walker's is the very standard for what good shortbread should be. Therefor,e,  I was a tad bit surprised to find that these cookies were not quite up to the normal Walker's quality.\n\nThe boxes of cookies were fresh and undamaged, not a broken cookie in sight, so that could not be the problem. It appears that the alterations required to produce a chocolate shortbread batter make a less flaky and delicate cookie. The chocolate taste was just a bit strong, lovely for chocoholics , but less exciting for the pure shortbread contingent.\n\nThe most noticeable feature of Walker's shortbread has always been the amazingly rich and buttery fragrance, along with a light and delicate crumb. The addition of chocolate tends  to obscure the buttery fragrance,  Also,, the texture of the chocolate variety of this Walker's Shortbread is a bit tougher, and the crumb is less fine thanthat of the standard Walker's shortbread.\n\nIf you are a big fan of chocolate, and prefer more of that taste, then these cookies will be quite suitable for you. If, as some are, your entire shortbread experience is heavily based-upon the rich and buttery flavor, and the fine crumb, you will be better served with the original, and non-chocolatey version.\n\nThese are nice cookies, the  little dog figure is quite sweet,  and they are of high quality. For chocolate lovers everywhere, these are a fine choice.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nRoland Sushi Ginger, 16 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI eat a lot of sushi, and acquired a strong liking for pickled ginger.

It requires quite a bit to taste a hint of sweetness. I was happy b/c I heard it was lower glycemic than regular sugar, etc etc...however, when you have to triple the amount you would use just to taste a little hint of sweetness, it cancels out b/c you end up using more & getting more calories, carbs, etc. I could use half of the amount of regular sugar to achieve the slightly sweet taste I like in my coffee. Seriously..I had to dump a whole lot of it in my coffee just for a little sweetness. Sorry, just don't think its strong enough, which leads to using more to achieve the taste your after. Regular sugar, maple syrup, or honey is 10x sweeter while using MUCH less. Just get organic & call it a day. Will stick to what I was using...Organic maple syrup or Date sugar.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nEndangered Species Panther, Natural Dark Chocolate Squares (88% Cocoa), 10-Count Individually Wrapped Pieces (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nDark and smooth.

When you first get the pump to put into a new bottle, you'll need to hold a cup or something under the spout and do a couple pumps.  You don't necessarily have to pump the liquid out, but you do need to get some of the liquid up into the tube so that you have room to screw the pump lid on without overflowing the brand new bottle of syrup.

I was a little surprised at the smaller size of the package, but that's my fault for not paying more attention to the weight.  These taste VERY good!  Fresh and soft with a slight denseness that comes with higher quality marshmallows, and perfect flavor.  I don't notice any aftertaste either.  I love them so much!  I didn't want to spend extra for the chocolate kind, so sometimes I'll layer it with a caramel Atkins square, and BOY that is heavenly!  They do raise my blood sugar a little bit, but nothing too dramatic.  Just don't eat the whole package in one sitting, because the sugar alcohol carbs can add up if you eat too much at once.

I just ordered my second jar. It was a hit at Christmas dinner, and were New England white people with palates of New England white people. I still prefer super spicy food and noticed some reviewers mentioned its not spicy enough. I say you just have to add more of this curry. In India spices are an ingredient not a condiment. Like, go crazy with this. Dump in a cup. Youll taste the spiciness then. What I will observe is that the flavors besides just spicy are big... but thats a good thing. My aunt had never tried curry and she loved this. My brothers girlfriend kept coming back for more and even the five year old loved it, adventurer that he is. My family is mostly vegan now so were really exploring new flavors and Im certain Ill be buying this again - as well as looking at other spices from this seller. I made veggie and red lentil curry using coconut oil and potatoes and diced tomatoes. Its a really fine grind - if youve cooked with curries you know this is best - and I like working with it better than paste. Its a great price too. One more thing, the packaging is easy!!! No bags to re-seal, no refrigerator needed.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHealthworks Quinoa White Whole Grain Raw Organic, 10lb (5 2lb Packs)\nReview:\nSomeone mentioned this was a fluffy or sticky quinoa but that's not quite my experience - it's a standard grain that changes depending on how you cook it. I use a pressure cooker 1 cup quinoa to 1.5 cups water, 1 minute & natural pressure release. Perfect every time. A bit nutty, the way I like it. Versatile. Great price. I rinse beforehand & that's recommended with this (not pre-rinsed). That's a slight pain honestly. I'll probably get pre-rinsed in the future. But the price is right!

This one makes yummy booch. I prefer bagged teas because the process is easier. I find that plain old Lipton, brewed only three minutes, is better than the green/black blend. You need fewer bags than you think - people always say 8-12 for a gallon but half that is better. Sometimes I'll add a green tea bag to mix things up. I truly enjoyed this tea, I'm glad I tried it, and I will use up the whole bag. I just can't say it's worth the cost & self-bagging effort - so, unless I'm prepping booch on a lazy weekend, usually I go back to my bagged teas which also make delicious booch.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nOrganic Turmeric Powder - 1LB Jar - 100% Raw w/Curcumin From India - by Jiva Organics\nReview:\nThis is a lovely yellow curry mix.

This powder fixes that - it makes a nice sauce in and of itself ((and it's good mixed into all sorts of other things, too!)), but it also makes a very good \"matrix\" into which very sharp, harder cheddar can be melted.\n\nThere are very few ingredients in it, which is why I decided to try it ;)\nSome folks have said it tastes like the here-unnamed \"famous boxed brand-name mac and cheese\".  I didn't grow up eating that, so I went ahead and tried some a few years back, shortly before I turned 58 - and I trashed it after the first bite. This is NOT that!!!  This is actually cheese, with some buttermilk and whey protein (which is a component of milk).  The yellow color is from Anatto, which is derived from the nut of a shrubby South American tree that's been used for food and other uses for thousands of years. Some people raise a fuss about Anatto because some folks do seem to have an allergy to it ((just as some people have an allergy to peanuts, and/or other various foods)), but Anatto is so widely used, including in butter, so if you're allergic, you probably found out early on.\n\nIn the absence of such an allergy, I recommend this as a tasty addition to one's pantry.  I haven't yet tried making any sort of cheese crackers or rolls with it, but I'm betting it would be good in baked goods as well, for those folks who like ((or need)) to make their own.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Buckwheat Flour, 22-ounce (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI enthusiastically like everything I've gotten from Bob's Red Mill - the quality is always high, and I like that it's a o-op sort of arrangement.\n\nThe Buckwheat flour (like all of their flours) is fine and evenly-sized, delicious, and a pleasure to use, especially for those for those of us with wheat allergies.\n\nI have - and keep! - my pantry stocked with a variety of Bob's Red Mill non-wheat flours.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSuzie's Whole Grain Thin Cakes, Puffed Brown Rice Crackers, 4.9-Ounce Bags (136g) (Pack of 12)\nReview:\n- Basically, \"Suzie's Whole Grain Thin Cakes, Puffed Brown Rice Crackers\" are UNSALTED thin brown-rice cakes.  But the operative word there is THIN.  Maybe 1/4\"/apx 6mm or a bit less.  They also are less crumbly than \"regular\" rice cakes.  And the brown rice gives them a bit more taste and 'substance'.  I also think the size is perfect.\n - What I get is the ultra-plain, no salt, nothing-but-rice ones.  They're a bit bland, I guess, for eating on their own ((to me, they taste a bit like plain pop-corn)), but I generally use them as a substitute for bread ((I don't have a gluten problem - I have an allergy problem)), so I've used them for everything from little \"pseudo-Ruben\" type things, to mini-pizzas, to tuna \"sandwiches\", to having them with peanut butter.  Or just melting some cheddar on them.  And so on.\n - And again, they seem to me to be a little more \"dense\" and less crumbly than regular rice cakes.  So, they hold the toppings, and don't clash with anything.\n - As long as they keep selling them, I definitely will keep getting them, because they are, for me, the best \"bread substitute\" I've found.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSan-J Tamari Gluten Free Soy Sauce, Non GMO Black Label, 64 Ounce\nReview:\nThis is my favorite soy sauce - it's 100% soy, NO WHEAT, hooray!, and it's delicious.

This is by far THE BEST non-wheat pasta I've ever had!  The texture is not at all grainy, but rather, is smooth very pleasant, *very* much like \"regular\" pasta; the flavor is excellent ((I do not at all like the wheat-free pastas that are made with corn :p )); and it's *easy to cook*, tolerates even a bit of over-cooking, and retains its structure - some non-wheat pastas get crumbly, but not this one.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Co-op Organic Korintje Cinnamon, Ground, A Grade, 1 Pound Bulk Bag (Pack of 2)\nReview:\n- This is DELICIOUS cinnamon!\n - I never ordered spices online before very recently, and when I saw that this was from Frontier, I gave it a whirl.\n - My expectations were definitely exceeded!\n - It is very fragrant and has a full-bodies flavor, without the harsh edges that the common store bought \"cassia\" type has.  I've bought Korintje cinnamon locally in the past, but this Frontier cinnamon is sooooooo much better!\n - It came in two bags, so I popped one into the freezer and transferred part of the other to a \"daily use\" container, and keep the main bag in the fridge.

I've been enjoying everything I've made with them :)\n - I received them quickly, too :)\n - So yes, I'll get these again, to be sure - better pricing than the local grocery store, and that's when I can get someone to go to the store for me, since I can't get around well at all at this point.

(Pack of 3)\nReview:\nLovely tea.  The peach does not overpower.  The fragrance is truly orchid-like.  Not bitter either.  One of my favorites from Mighty Leaf.\n\nDon't over-brew this one:  Usually white teas require five or six minutes to steep, but this one will loose its peach and melon flavor if steeped that long.  No more than three minutes works well for me.  Also, do not use boiling water; let boiling water sit for several minutes before pouring over white teas (or do not bring it to a boil). White teas like 180 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nHighly recommend if you like a floral fragrance in your tea.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDole Pineapple Chunks in Heavy Syrup, 8.25 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nCome warmer weather and we turn from soups and stews to grilled and lighter dishes, I make sure I always have a can of these Dole Pineapple Chunks on the pantry shelf.  When I don't have an appropriate fresh fruit, and I need a sweet-sour-spicy salsa for fish or chicken, I grab this can.\n\nThe pineapple is as close to fresh as it can be.  I buy the chunks so I can chop it into smaller pieces myself.  I believe the bigger chunks hold their flavor in the can better.  And we like a bigger chop than what comes crushed, and a smaller chop than comes with the tidbits.  Plus, these chunks work for kebobs, too.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKnorr Pasta Sides, Beef 4.3 oz\nReview:\nAfter serving Knorr's Smokehouse Bacon Parmesan Pasta Sides to my family at dinner last week, they insisted that they would not ever try another Pasta Sides flavor. So, I cooked this up during the day, just to give it a try.  I tasted a few spoonfuls to confirm that my pre-conceived opinion was correct, then I dumped the rest.  I didn't even want to give it to the chickens in the yard, because I felt the wimpy noodles and excessive salt were not healthy for them.\n\nThis package makes two cups prepared pasta.  One cup is considered a serving size.  I was appalled to see that one cup of this stuff contains 31% of a person's recommended daily salt intake.  And I could only stand at the counter and shake my head when I read that two cups of this weighed in at 580 calories--and this is just a side dish?!?\n\nIf you try this product, remember to not exceed the 12 minute boiling time in an effort to get the sauce to thicken; your noodles will be mush.  Thickening occurs during the two minute resting period after you take it off the flame.\n\nI don't know why anyone would bother with this product, as it isn't even a true \"convenience\" food that you can pop into the microwave at work.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nZICO Watermelon Raspberry Coconut Water Drink, 16.9 fl oz, 12 Pack\nReview:\nHaving been lucky enough to have once lived in an area where I was able to crack open as many fresh green coconuts as I desired, I must say that the flavor in these bottles is decent:  Not perfect, but not bad.  I had to get it really, really ice cold to achieve the correct flavor.  Coconut water right out of the shell is extremely refreshing, and I don't think it can ever be correctly duplicated.  (Same like the juice from a freshly-squeezed lime or lemon loses its true taste as it ages.)  But his offering from Zico comes close.  And the aftertaste is authentic, too.\n\nI don't think that all people understand that fresh coconut water does not taste like coconut meat.  Coconut water has only a hint of the flavor of  coconut meat, and it has a slight tang and almost a slight \"soapy\" taste.  It is nothing like coconut milk or coconut cream.  And its nothing like the coconut flavor in a pina colada.\n\nI'll say it's decent enough flavor to bring back memories of shaking green coconuts to listen to the slosh of the water inside.  Then taking a machete and trimming off the top of the tough outer green of the coconut.  The final swipe would expose a hole to the inside.  Bring it to the lips and some water would always trickle down my chin.  When the water was gone, I would crack the coconut open and use one of the ovals from what was trimmed from the top to scoop out the jelly inside.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLee Kum Kee Premium Oyster Sauce, 18-Ounce Glass Bottles (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nYes, this oyster sauce is more expensive than many others, but it gives so much more flavor that it is worth it to me.  It has a richness that the others do not have.  It has a meaty flavor.  It has a deep flavor.  If I want to quick throw a stir fry together, I drizzle a tablespoon of this oyster sauce, a tablespoon of a hoisin, and a bit of low salt soy sauce.  It makes a great sauce!\n\nI've been using it for years and am never without a follow-up bottle on my pantry shelf.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFISHER Chef's Naturals Slivered Almonds, No Preservatives, Non-GMO, 2 oz (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nAlmonds taste fine, but the bag I received contained more little pieces and brown skin than pretty slices.

All I added was EarthBalance butter, salt and pepper, with a touch of garlic powder and paprika. I was certainly a hit among us normally gluten free eaters.

So when I noticed this brownie mix, I had to try them. As I followed instructions, I noticed the batter was super dense. No problem, I just spread it till it reaches the edges of the pan. We tried these warm and they were ok. We both agreed they were no like brownie (chewy and chocolatey)they tasted \"off\" but familiar. We agreed, they were more like a crumbly fudge cake. After we tried them cooled down, I figured it out what was off...it was too much baking soda/powder flavor. Not really sure but I know I got that after taste when I was learning to bake as a teen. If we ever try these again, we will load them up with other things like blue berries, chocolate chips, nuts, coconut, or whatever I have around.\n\nWould I recommend? It depends. I don't need a gluten free diet. So, for those who are like me in that way, then No. For those who need gluten free, then Yes.\n\nMy favorite brownie to date, is Trader Joe's brownie mix...oh, with Biscoff spread, OMG!

With no noodles, it was great (even thought of not adding the noodles - but they should make it better, right?). Then I added the noodles, cooked them 8m (like the pkg indicates), and poured it right in a bowl to enjoy. At first I thought it was me, cause something tasted yucky. You might be asking, \"hey is she used to gluten free products?\", Well yes, been gf for about 6m & have eaten many noodles. Well it ruined my soup! I thought letting it sit would make it better. Nope! The funky taste got stronger. All that soup gone to waste. Then I realized this product is not made with GMO free corn. My mistake for not reading.

It surprises me how very different coconut sugars can be, some are grainier, sweeter, clump together and have almost a bitter taste (like this one).

First of all... the different brands utilize coconuts from different parts of the globe.  That in and of itself would cause flavor differences.  But, the other thing that came to mind is how the same tree can produce different flavor and texture results in things like oranges and apples depending on the weather pattern for that season, etc.  Perhaps the same applies to coconuts?  In any case, of all the brands I've tried, this is by far my favorite.  I decided to try drinking coconut water to help with lowering my blood pressure and it has definitely done that.

They're barely toasted at all, so they don't have much flavor.\n\nOn the other hand, they're a healthy snack, and not that bad.  They certainly don't lead me to overeat.

They are indeed delicious - though I find the coconut and yogurt flavors come through much more strongly than the apricot.  They're somewhat more filling than Larabars - 235 calories vs. 180 calories, in both cases half fat.  There's big difference in saturated fat - 9 grams for \"Eat Natural\", 1 for Larabars, and \"Eat Natural\" bars have almost 20 times the sodium (95 mg, as compared to 5 mg), and half the fiber (2 grams as compared to the Larabar's four).  \"Eat Natural\" ingredients don't get any more unnatural-sounding than soya lecithin, glucose syrup, and dextrose - but the list is certainly a whole lot longer than my Larabar's \"dates, almonds, unsweetened apples, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon\" (yes, that's all).\n  These \"Eat Natural\" bars do taste good and are a little better at killing hunger pangs than Larabars.  I might buy them again sometime if I find I need a snack that's a little better at killing hunger but think I'll stick to Larabars in the meantime.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nEat Natural Bars: Almond &amp; Raisin with Brazil Nuts &amp; Peanuts, 1.76-Ounce, 12-Count Boxes\nReview:\nNot something I'll buy again - rather bland puffed rice and nuts (mostly Brazil nuts and almonds), sweetened with glucose syrup and with some raisins mixed in - the only fruit I could taste, though the ingredient list includes apricots and peach.  The result is bland as well as overly sweet.  Though \"Eat Natural\" yogurt-coated almond & apricot bars are even sweeter, they're far tastier and would be my choice if I were to buy \"Eat Natural\" bars again.  I prefer Larabars to either - though I know they're not everyone's cup of tea.  (And the dates and other fruit used to sweeten Larabars seem more natural ingredients to me than the glucose syrup used to sweeten \"Eat Natural\" bars.)\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nRaw Almonds from California - 10 (1 Lb) Resealable Packages\nReview:\nThese are great almonds - bigger and not as dried out as the ones I've been paying a lot more for at the grocery store.

Not just my imagination - I brought them with me as part of my contribution of food for a 13-hour session working the polls at a special election recently, and they were a big hit with everyone else too.\n\nThe box they come in works as a dispenser - has a drop-down panel at the front.

AND mostly xylitol - the sugar substitute I prefer anyway.  So I order one bag to try it, and quickly went back to order more.\n\nIt's great stuff - more like light brown sugar than dark brown, so I need to add a tad of molasses in some of my baking.  And of course like plain xylitol, it's much drier than sugar, but adding a little applesauce to whatever I'm baking helps with that.\n\nBut mostly I use it on my breakfast cereal - sprinkling cinnamon in the bottom of the bowl, adding&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bob-s-Red-Mill-Gluten-Free-Whole-Grain-Rolled-Oats-32-Ounce-Bags-Pack-of-4/dp/B002TXT502/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain, Rolled Oats, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;and a handful of raisins, microwaving it, and topping it with Ideal Brown no-cal sweetener.

The powder itself provides:\n\n60 calories per serving with 10 grams of protein (almond milk adds 30/1, respectively),\n4 grams of prebiotic fiber, with .5 grams of sugar, 90 mg of sodium,( 1/0/180),\n50 mg of potassium, and no total fat, saturated fat, or trans fats.(170/2.5/0/0).\n\nEach serving is .8 of an ounce by weight using the enclosed plastic serving spoon and it is to be mixed with either water or unsweetened almond milk. With water, it is chocolatey and filling but not very tasty; with regular milk, which is not recommended in the directions, it tastes better and is filling; but the fat, vitamins, and sugar content must be added to the nutrition facts on the Designer Protein can; and with unsweetened almond milk it tastes much better. It tastes better with almond milk which can be expensive, but water is an option. The chocolate cookies and cream taste was achieved in my case using Blue Diamond \"Almond Breeze unsweetened almondmilk\". Highly Recommended for the health benefits and the low price.

It also packs 28 grams of sugar, 34 carbs, 3 grams of fiber, 160 mg of sodium, and 5 mg of cholesterol, and 210 calories.\n\n Beyond this, in a 10 ounce bottle and based on a 2000 calorie daily standard, it has 30% of Vitamins A, D, and C, 15% Vitamins K and B12, 20% foliate and iron, lesser amounts of thiamin, niacin, B6, & riboflavin, and an impressive 40% Calcium. A special point is that it does not contain high fructose corn syrup. The only drawback for some may be the high sugar content, but it gives a delicious protein, sugar and vitamin boost.

Here are some tips on using it:\n\nRehydrate your TVP in a double or triple strength liquid, like bouillon or soup base with twice or triple the recommended amount added to the water.\n\nCover the TVP with the bouillon or soup mixture until it kind of sloshes around.  It will absorb more liquid over time.\n\nAfter the liquid has absorbed (usually 10 minutes or so) taste test it to see if the seasoning is to your liking.  You can add more seasoning, or add more TVP depending on how strong it is.\n\nOnce it's at the right flavor, use your culinary skills to give it some kick.  Add an egg and some breadcrumbs, and make TVP burgers or \"meat\"balls.  Add some cumin, onion, garlic, and chili, thicken with a little starch, and you get TVP taco filling.  The possibilities are endless!\n\nBIG SECRET tip: Use a little sugar in your hydrating liquid if you are going to brown the TVP in any way, as in taco filling or patties.  The sugar will help it brown (Google: Maillard Reaction) And if your dishes are tasting salty without tasting \"savory\" try adding a little nutritional yeast, or yeast extract.\n\nMy only complaint: this TVP is pale, like breadcrumbs. I like my TVP to have a nice dark color usually, but it all tastes the same, so not a big deal.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nPopin' Cookin' Happy Sushi House by Hamee\nReview:\nIt's not sushi flavored, don't worry!  :)\n\nMy favorite part are the little \"eggs\" made by dropping one mixture into the other.

Quinoa naturally has a slightly bitter coating which has to be rinsed off. This can be a little bit difficult since it's such a tiny seed. That means it has to be rinsed in a fine mesh strainer and often sticks to the strainer This product saves that step. It's already washed. Quinoa is nice for a change of pace from rice or other grains but can be prepared in much the same manner. It's actually a seed and not a grain and has a more complete protein profile than rice. I usually prepare it in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Stainless-Steel-Rice-Cooker-Model-ME81-Formerly-ME8-by-Miracle-Exclusives/dp/B000I5UEQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Stainless Steel Rice Cooker Model ME81 (Formerly ME8) - by Miracle Exclusives</a>&nbsp;and often mix it with barley or brown rice and cook them together. I use about two parts of water to one part quinoa. I often use it for Tabouli Salad to replace the bulgar. I've also used it in pilaf and in chilled salads with vegetables. It works very well in a rice pudding type of dish too. (In place of the rice.)\n\nQuinoa has an impressive nutrient profile as well. It has 50% more protein than brown rice and more fibre. A cup of brown rice has 14 per cent of the recommended daily fibre. As good as that is, quinoa does rice even better, with 21 per cent. It also is one of the few plant sources that contains a complete protein meaning that it has all of the protein forming amino acids.\n\nSample received for review.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nEmergency Preparedness &amp; Survival Gluten-Free Food Supply - All Natural, Kosher, Non-GMO - 10 Year Shelf Life - 15 Servings\nReview:\nThese aren't the kind of jelly beans where you stuff a handful into your mouth.  These are meant to be savored and enjoyed one at a time.  Each has a vibrant, distinctive flavor, the kind you want savor, one at a time.  And this sampler is the perfect way to try a variety of David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans.  It provides a nice variety including bacon, black cherry, blueberry, coconut, cranberry, ginger, grape, green apple, Himalayan sea salt, lemon, orange punch, peach, pomegranite, root beer, strawberry and vanilla bean.  All of them were very good, but my personal favorites were strawberry, lemon, coconut and bacon.  I have to admit that the bacon was a strange flavor for a jelly bean.  Maybe that's why I liked it.  It had sort of a burnt flavor, like bacon when it's crispy.\n\nThese jelly beans use natural flavors that are quite intense.  One of these small beans fills your whole mouth with flavor.

The bacon, ginger and Himilayan Sea salt flavors from this sampler are included, but there is also a chipotle, Thai chili, wasabi and a habanero jelly bean that is three-alarm hot!  If you like unusual flavors you have to give them a try too.\n\nFrom what I understand David Klein created the first gourmet jelly beans some 35 years ago, so he's quite accomplished when it comes to unique flavors that are fun to taste.

The flavors remind me of summer. It doesnt contain any regular tea leaves, making it actually a tisane. Ive switched to caffeine-free drinks lately, so this is perfect. The flavors make it a natural for an ice tea but its also very good as a hot brewed tea. To make it iced, I just brew it hot with a smaller amount of boiling water, and then add ice once its brewed.\n\nIve been using a lot of loose teas lately because I like having more control over the strength of the Tea and because its actually quite a good deal moneywise using the loose rather than teabags. I love these canisters with the airtight seals that Tiesta uses.

Each bar weighs 1.20 ounces, which isn't a lot, but the flavors, especially the dark chocolate, make them satisfying. They are just 150 calories each so they're a good snack for those of us trying to keep our weight down. They're low enough that they don't cause that big sugar drop a half hour or so after eating them like some regular candy bars do. They have 2 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein per bar. I like that they're GMO-free. They aren't a health food, but they fit in with my plan for a reasonable number of calories in a snack while still tasting very good.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYogi Tea - Echinacea Immune Support - Supports Immune Function - 6 Pack, 96 Tea Bags Total\nReview:\nMy husband often has a scratchy throat, probably from acid reflux.

They aren't too sweet which I appreciate when trying to lose weight and not overeat, because they don't give my that blood sugar spike that a lot of energy bars give which end up making me want to keep eating. These are satisfying and I love the jalapeno. It's heat is bold but not overwhelming. For me, it's just the right amount of heat. One bar is 230 calories but with all the almonds, pumpkin and hemp seeds it's very satisfying makes me feel full for a couple of hours after I eat one. The ingredients are: almonds, pumpkin and hemp seeds, honey, non-GMO glucose, and pea crisps, jalapeno chili, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked sea salt and sunflower lecithin. The nuts and seeds are whole, not mashed into some gooey mass and baked. I like being able to taste the indivual ingredients. The slight smoky taste is perfect with the other natural flavors. These are more savory than sweet.  I will definitely keep buying these.\n\nUpdate 4/8/15 - I just had one of these bars from a different box, a box of 4. The heat was gone. I could barely taste it. I hope it was just that bar and not the rest of the box as well. The heat was what I liked about this bar. I hope they didn't change the recipe.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I find the flavor of this tea to be quite good considering that it not one of the more expensive teas that I have tried.  It is better to me served chilled than hot.  I prefer my tea to be very strong with very little sweetener & no cream at all.  I usually prefer teas either hot or cold based on the individual tea.  This is one of the flavors that is good either hot or chilled, but I do think the flavor is stronger when it is chilled.  They changed the ingredients a few years after it was marketed.

Give these a pass and find some higher quality cookies.\n\nI love good lemon cookies, these really are not very good at all.  The lemon flavor is there but subdued and not terribly \"fresh\" tasting.  The cookie is soft to the point of crumbing in your hand and even taking one out of the package is likely to break pieces off and scatter your table with crumbs.\n\nThere are far too many unneeded ingredients and they use (or may use) palm oil and other cheap oils and high-fructose corn syrup.  For those to whom it matters, they use some level of genetically modified foods.  I do nor care and this is not really a genuine issue but many people do care and I present the facts so people may make their own decisions.\n\nI'd suggest not giving these to small kids as it is going to be an unqualified mess as the cookies break apart if you glance at them and a small child will simply turn this into a cleaning mess with sticky crumbs and bits of \"frosting\" all over the landscape.\n\nIn fact, I'd simply suggest giving them a complete miss regardless.  These are third rate cookies at best, in my opinion, and not worth the cost or calories.  Archway has always been a \"brand of last resort\" in my experience and nothing here changes my mind in the least.\n\nAddendum:  As others mention, these leave an unpleasant aftertaste that lingers.

Not sure I'll continue to use it though as it is one third sugar.\n\nNo idea if they are all like that but that's way too much sugar.  It occurs three times on the ingredient list in various places and there's 10 grams of sugar in a 30 gram serving. Sugar is the next ingredient after peppers.  Ridiculous.\n\nThe flavor is good.  This stuff is no foolin' spicy.  I like it.  Good \"burn\" without overdoing it.  Reminds just a bit of Tabasco Sauce although the flavor is decidedly different.  There is (obviously) a sweet aftertaste as well from all that brown sugar and cane sugar.  Too much really for my taste.\n\nMaybe in summer if you can use it like a barbecue sauce to get that caramelized flavor on the grill it may work better, but for for my use it's just sugary hot sauce and I can get great hot sauces without all the extra sugar for a lot less money.\n\nNot meaning to harp on this as I'm not particularly a health nut but if excess sugar in your diet matters, use this with caution.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nJack Link's Meat Snacks Beef Jerky, Peppered, 5.85 Ounce\nReview:\nRather like Pastrami Jerky...and that's a good thing.

No idea what that is doing in my beef jerky but be aware if such things matter to you.\n\nOverall, a great snack and a very traditional one.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nNongShim Neoguri Noodle, Spicy Seafood, 4.2 Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)\nReview:\nI was hankering for something a bit different from standard Ramen.  I gave these a try and they are a serious hit.\n\nThey take about ten minutes end to end using a microwave (I add some dried shrimp for a bit more flavor and Umami.  The noodles plump up well and have a good texture with a decent \"bite\" to them, they are not soggy paste. They don't dall apart and remind me of a decent pasta.\n\nThe broth is definitely spicy/hot.  Not \"burn your mouth \" hot but not fooling around either.  There's a great seafood flavor and an intruiging mix of ocean life (sand lance anyone?)\n\nAs usual, there's a ton of sodium so this may not be for everyone and it's not low calorie either, a full pack is a bit over 500 calories.  They play the usual game about portions and presume there's two portions in the bag.  I doubt most folk will divvy it up but there is enough that you could do so without feeling like you are making portions for a child's tea party.\n\nOn a cold, damp, rainy day, this is a nice way to warm up and I intend to keep some around and try their other flavors and maybe add some dried bonito flakes as well.  This stuff is a good platform for experiments.\n\nTasty, hearty and highly recommended to fill that void in your tummy or your craving for noodles.\n(Note, the product has origins in Korea I think but the version sold here is made in the USA.)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBuzz and Bloom Honey Creamy Spread, Original, 12 Ounce\nReview:\nA very creamy honey.

It would seem Ukrainian bees do a fine job of work.  ;)\n\nHighly recommended for a breakfast or snack \"change-up\" or to put some zip in your morning sip.  I suspect this will be superb in a cup of coffee with some Cognac or in a Mocha with some Coffee liqueur as well. I shall report back on this once I try one or the other.

Have a napkin on the table or desk as you're going to get tuna crumbs all over unless you have the dexterity of a surgeon.\n\nThe included crackers are decent but not spectacular and work as a vehicle to hold the tuna and can be gently used to \"spoon\" upt he tuna once the can is somewhat empty.  Works better than the tiny plastic \"spoon\" provided/.\n\nThe chipotle flavor drowns out the tuna completely and lacks the subtle heat and warmth of the good stuff like the assorted \"rooster sauces\".\n\nThis will do as a back-up snack or such but only if you have water or milk or something to tame the annoying afterburn.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nPure Leaf Tea House Collection, Organic Iced Tea, Wild Blackberry &amp; Sage, 14 Ounce Bottles, Pack of 8\nReview:\nIt's summer.  Where I live has had record breaking heat and the joy of smoke from major brush fires.  Add in the place not being fully air conditioned (Didn't used to need it in these parts) and you have the \"prefect storm\" that is best quenched by a nice iced tea (at least until I get bids on adding real A/C).\n\nNow, while I enjoy iced tea, I am coming to dislike the heavily sweetened versions moistly available.  This particular line, while being sweetened, does use cane sugar rather than corn sweetener and uses it judiciously.\n\nA bottle of this is 90 calories while a similar bottle of \"Gold Peak\" is 180 calories. Another brand I like, Tea's Tea, is zero calories with no artificial sweeteners but is a bit more of an acquired taste if you are used to the fizzy corn syrup and water that passes for sodas and such in the USA.  (I do suggest trying it...the Jasmine green tea does not *need* sugar and your palate will awaken.)\n\nThere are multiple flavors in this particular assortment but I am only going to comment on the Sicilian Lemon and Honeysuckle as that is what I have had so far.  I may add an update when I get to the Blackberry and Sage one as that really sounds odd.\n\nShort form:  Good stuff, a refreshing drink that is not overly sweet.\n\nThe lemon is tart without being bitter or making you pucker and the honeysuckle brings up distant chords of memory from when my grandfather taught me when I was a child to pick and enjoy honeysuckle nectar right off the vine.  Refreshment and nostalgia in one bottle, a nice combo.\n\nif you want to advance your taste and selection past Lipton and Snapple, you won't go wrong giving these a try.  You might not like every flavor but experiment, you may find something you didn't know you loved.\n\nFlavor Update:  Just finished a bottle of the \"Blackberry and Sage\".  Interesting.  They use brewed blackberry leaves and brewed sage leaves along with the usual black tea.\n\nMakes for a different but not unacceptable variant.  The blackberry leaves add a deep, mildly tart note and the sage presents an almost savory aftertaste that is not unpleasant but does linger.\n\nI'd not want this every day but it is an intriguing variant on an old stand-by.

There is a definite split in our population between those who become exuberant over their phony mango shampoos, etc. and those who know a toad when they see one.\n\nThis flavor combo is so intense it has even absorbed itself into my plastic insulated cup and I can't get it out. You know that highpitched overly sweet chemically induced maddness that resembles so many cosmetics these days. Out, out dammed spot for I have poisoned the queen...eek.  And all that sugar...omg no it is not better than aspertame. It makes children wild and mice sick and loves cancer.\n\n Make these doggone sodas yourself; get some seltzer better yet Perrier or mineral water, and add some real mango juice and yogurt or juice your own strawberries.  Naturalists avoid this simile made with benzyole hydrate and concentrate on the living.\n\n  And try using Xylitol....may have to dissolve it in warm water first but tastes much better than all the others and 1/2 the cal of sugar and natural to the body.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nV8 Golden Butternut Squash Soup, 18.3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nI usually buy Wolfgang Puck's Butternut soup which is delicious and rich in flavor.

The flavor balance is excellent, and the (added) peanut butter adds amazing richness and depth.\n\nI made it with the meat from a turkey drumstick leftover from Thanksgiving, and it was perfect. The hardest part was cutting the meat off the drumstick! The only other add-ins are chicken broth (6 cups), and a cup of peanut butter; I used mostly unsalted natural style, since i don't think high-fructose corn syrup would be a welcome addition to the flavors.\n\nI recommend this highly. It is only very slightly spicy; heat-lovers might want to supplement that a bit, though as-is, I can't see anyone objecting to it. If you are allergic to peanuts, I think sunflower butter would work equally well. I really liked the turkey in it, but the chicken the recipe calls for would be lovely, too.\n\nIt is also very filling. It makes 4 servings, and those make a very satisfying meal, possibly with a salad. It's even better after resting overnight in the fridge- the vegetables get more succulent, the soup thickens up, and the flavors blend.\n\nI will definitely be buying this one again!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMaldon Sea Salt Flakes, 8.5 ounce Box\nReview:\nI love how handy this was to order.

And yet, so many recipes I want to try require it! OK, one can sub in balsamic, but that's definitely going to change the flavor.\n\nI was very happy to find it available through Amazon, and I hope my 2 bottles last a while.\n\nAlthough the packaging was excellent, the shipping cost was itself about as much as 1 bottle of the vinegar. So, if you can find it locally, that would be better than ordering it.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nFrontier Soups Hearty Meals Minnesota Heartland Eleven Bean Soup, 18-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nThis is a hearty and delicious soup, and it was both pretty easy and made LOTS. I really love the flavor balance, and all the beans were done at the finish time,\n\nWe did go with all the add-ins: ham hock (ours had lots of meat), kielbasa, and chicken breast. All the meats were from our meat CSA, by the way!\n\nThe meat combination makes this a sort of American cassoulet (which traditionally has pork, sausage, and poultry confit).\n\nA nice crusty bread makes the perfect accompaniment.\n\nIt does take some serious elapsed time, though most of it is hands-off. It's probably 6+ hours from start to finish, though that can be divided into a couple of days. The physical prep is easy and straightforward- mostly chopping veg and the sausage and chicken.\n\nAnd, like all the frontier kits I've tried thus far, it does not taste like a mix. It tastes homemade.\n\nCan you do similarly yourself? sure! but I love the mix of seasonings and beans, and the meat suggestions, and just not having to THINK!\n\nVery recommended!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHoosier Hill Farm Dry Malt (Diastatic) baking Powder 1.5 lb.\nReview:\nMy husband and i do home brewing, so we are not unacquainted with malts.\n\nThe problem with malts is- they are very hydrophilic- meaning, as soon as you open them, they glom onto any moisture in the air and turn into a sticky and sullen mass.\n\nThe packaging for this one is a huge help. It's far easier to seal it against humidity. It's not 100% effective- but it's a huge help.\n\nI think if you are brewing, you'd do better to buy malt powders or syrups from your local homebrew shop. But when one needs an occasional tablespoon or quarter cup for baking- this is really handy.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nHoosier Hill Farm Fermented Black Beans, 1.5 Pound\nReview:\nI do not live handy to a good Asian market, so I tend to either buy stuff online, or in the supermarkets.\n\nAs with spices, the supermarkets tend to charge a LOT more for smaller quantities.\n\nFailing a good Asian market opening up close, this kind of thing is great. It's a huge amount of fermented black beans for Chinese dishes, that costs per recipe a tiny fraction of what they do in the supermarket. The tightly-sealing jar in which they are shipped is also great.\n\nVery cost-effective, and of a good quality for Chinese black bean dishes.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I usually get players but wanted to try the Fisher brand and was pleased with their flavor and crunch. Planters dry roasted peanuts have a very mild flavor than works as a snack or you can use in desserts since they do not taste very savory. These Fisher dry roasted peanuts are way more savory in a good way that is great as a snack or on salads like This satay salad and such. I would not use these in desserts, you can really taste the paprika and spices, which I really like but you should be aware of.\n\nThere was a TON of spice sediment in the hat that I had to sift out to avoid dumping powder in my hand when grabbing a handful for a snack. I will be buying these in the future when this jar is finished, they are very satisfying and great on curry and thai dishes! Get Planters if you are making rocky road fudge or other sweet.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nEmerald Nuts Dry Roasted Almonds, 11-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nI find the flavor of these almonds to be wonderfully savory, the coating is barely covering the nut but really keeps them nice and crunchy.  I think the coating has the same flavor profile as old fashioned dry roasted peanuts, the slightly seasoned ones I remember my grandma always having a jar of.\n\nI guess these are really a love them or leave them type of product; you'll notice the very high or very low star ratings, not one 3 star review when I tasted these.  I think the split is because the almonds do not have the word \"seasoned\" in the title so people looking for plain almonds feel duped.  I also see that some people are mad about them containing MSG; it is listed clearly in the ingredient list so you can avoid it if you have problems consuming it.  Some people get sick or bad headaches so this is an important thing to be aware of if you are sensitive.\n\nI can see how someone would be put off by any flavor if they were looking for plain; my advice is to always hunt down the ingredient list to any food you are planning to buy without tasting first, especially if ordering in bulk.  I went to the grocery store and got one jar of these to see if I liked them, when these are gone I will be getting these in bulk here on amazon since I paid almost $6 for one jar.  Good flavor, good value.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nYumEarth Organic Lollipops, Assorted Flavors, 5 Pound Bag\nReview:\nI had morning sickness so bad it lasted all day and for 5.5 months, ugh!

After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator.\n\nMy impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna.  This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce.  Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon of the mayonnaise.  The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to the mayonnaise-based version.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce.  I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions. They both work equally well.

I wanted something that would cream my coffee without needing refrigeration, and this is perfect. I may never buy the liquid again, actually. This can be used with or without milk, and tastes wonderful. It does not completely dissolve in the hot coffee sometimes, but the tiny bits that float detract nothing from the flavor or texture of the beverage, which is all I care about.\n\nYou can also mix it with whole milk ahead of time, using a stick blender or other appliance, and store it in the refrigerator.

I can't swear to it because the pieces are very tiny but they are hard.  So it seemed that either the truffles had dried out or were dried and reconstituted or simply not particularly fresh, rich or aromatic.  For the price, rather disappointed.

I really did.  I made pot after pot, day in day out and I was convinced this was the best coffee around.  But the quality has veeeeeeeeeeery verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry slowly been changing.  Its good coffee, don't get me wrong.  But it's no longer superior coffee.  It has that awful back taste that lesser blends or not so fresh beans have...an ugly bite.  No amount of french roasting will cover the fact that a bad bean is a bad bean.\n\nI can't say it's all bad.  It's just not superior.  I hung in there for a while, even mixing it with an expresso bean to ramp it up.  But all I see is that it makes the other coffee taste weak and bitter.  So the search is on again.\n\n________________previous revue________________\nit's got everything:\nrich roasted bean aroma before it's ground.\nfreshness\nperfect oil balance (the beans SHINE like little patent leather shoes)\nperfect acid balance\na touch of chocolate like flavor\nwiney\n\nfantastic coffee. Now I'm spoiled rotten.  Had to make do with a lesser (although I used to think the lesser was good coffee but now  pftt!) when I ran out, became miserable and surly without my morning perfect cup.  and this IS the perfect cup of coffee.\n\nif you're a coffee person, get yourself a coffee maker that grinds too, because no point in pregrinding and wrecking the perfection.  if you're gonna do it, do it right.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\n Cameron&#39;s Coffee Roasted Whole Bean Coffee, Flavored, Chocolate Caramel Brownie, 12 Ounce (Pack of 3) \nReview:\nI love Cameron's French roast, I love the quality of it, the high roast on the bean, love the overall flavor.  So I thought we'd enjoy their lighter roast too when we want a less robust coffee.  This didn't do it though. It's an adequate coffee, meaning not terrible and it is fresh, but it's got a back sort of oily/clanky flavor reminding me of supermarket brands, which isn't terrible but not good either.\n\nI always freeze my coffee, taking out what I need for about a week and storing those beans in a container in the frig, so the coffee is always fresh and we use a Cuisinart grind and brew, which makes great coffee.\n\nI would use it again if I had to, but I wouldn't recommend it as Cameron's best nor would I go out of my way to buy it.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\n LorAnn Extracts, Natural Madagascar Vanilla Bean Paste, 4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3) \nReview:\nWonderful product.

It's got a lighter fruitier more acidic flavor when used in the drip coffee maker (one scoop per cup of coffee on the carafe ie. 8 cups on the side, 8 scoops in the filter) I'm liking it much better as a cold brew coffee, it's very smooth in the cold brew (but then most everything is). I won't be ordering it again, I'm going to try the dark roast, instead. But I got this very very inexpensively, so I'm not that disappointed, I just can't rate it higher for the price, when people want a review of the taste. :)\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\n Lavazza Tierra! 100% Sustainable Ground Coffee, 8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3) \nReview:\n1st cup down, second cup being enjoyed. My can says it expires 5/2011 - I have no idea how far out they set their best used by dates, so I've no idea how long this has been around. However, my first and second cup of coffee were flavorful and NOT bitter or sour. I paid next to nothing for this coffee and would again, but I wouldn't pay the nearly 8 dollars per can it is now when I paid a little more than that for 3 cans. It wasn't a knock your socks off, I can never drink another cup unless it's this cup of joe - but it's smooth, mellow, and enjoyable, especially when I paid next to nothing for it. If I'm going to pay nearly 8 bucks for a 1/2 pound, I'll go up to the local coffee roaster and get it fresh. (oh, normally I don't get my coffee in ground form, I usually grind it myself, but this was soooo inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.)\n\nSide note - this is an espresso grind. I had no trouble with it floating or clogging, but I sprinkled it with some cold water to wet the grinds a bit before I started the brewing, that helps keep them from floating up. I also propped open the little spring loaded cover to the coffee basket with a skewer so it was as open as it could get. Result was a clear coffee and no mess. Ratio - one level coffee scoop per cup as measured on the carafe.\n\nedit update 3/29/2011 - I've now had about 9 cans of this coffee - it's my go to coffee, it's still smooth mellow and enjoyable and I've given it an extra star for consistency, it's been good through all those cans, when ever it's on a decent sale (usually on the Friday Sale) I buy it again, just got another 3 cans. I also use it for the rub I put on ribeyes and a rub I made up to put on a pork butt for pulled pork...good stuff!  :)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Almonds, Bold Habanero BBQ, 16 Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nOH MY WORD!! I love these, I love the bold flavored Blue Diamond almonds. Love this flavor first, then the wasabi then the salt vinegar. The Wasabi has a gram or so more of carbs, so I generally choose this one or the salt and vinegar. The problem for me is I'm an addict. If I got 3 pounds of these almonds, I'd eat 3 pounds of these almonds in short order. That being said. They are delicious, salty, a little spicy with a touch of sweeet - they are fantastic! This price is better than I get them at Wally World for the 6oz can and they are cheaper there than anywhere else. So, buy these, buy them now and hide the other bags from yourself (or send them to me) ...they are SO good, I'm eating them now! :\n\nHey Amazon, this is sold and shipped by you, it would be ever so nice if this came on the subscribe and save!\n\nNow that Wal-mart has lowered their prices on the 6oz cans - this amount in 6oz cans would cost 19 dollars and 84 cents 2.48 a can)- so, no savings, over buying them in store. A lot of time saved, however, to have them dropped off at your door.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Almonds  Bold  Wasabi &amp; Soy Sauce, Value Pack, 16-Ounce (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThey aren't quite as low carb as some of the other Bold flavors - but they are soooooo delicious...sometimes I forget to care! All of the Bold Flavors I've tried are fantastic. I already have a terrible addiction to crunchy nuts, pecans, macadamias, almonds, brazil...come to mama! (not a huge fan of cashews) But the Bold line of of these Blue Diamond almonds are just outrageously delicious.

I don't keep milk in the house. Well, I thought I'd try the sugar free concentrate as a quicker way to fix the tea, bought some milk and BLECH...it was so sweet I had to dump it. And it was not spicy. I love the Lipton's it's rich and spicy and tastes like drinking Christmas...I want some right now! So, I cannot recommend this at all. If you want a very very mild flavored tea that's extremely sweet - this is your stuff - and I have some you can have! Come on by, it's yours! :D\n\nUPDATE 12/23/12 - now make my Chai from the Celestial Seasonings Chai - which blows the Lipton out of the water, in fact, I had forgotten I made it from Lipton till I reread my review. Try the Chai from CS - but it is generally less expensive at Wally world. Yesterday I bought several boxes for 2.48 a box.

I have rinsed them, boiled them and rinsed them again and had no problem with them, but the texture doesn't bother me, the kind of semi rubbery texture of pearl tapioca. Honestly, I really like them and hope I can find them for less. I used the \"rice\" the other day in a dish of sausage, onions and peppers with some asparagus all sauteed together, I rinsed the rice and then put them in the microwave and nuked them for 5 minutes, drained and rinsed them again and then dumped them in the sausage veggie mix, they soaked up the pan juices and were delicious. I've enjoyed the noodles in Asian style dishes and with spaghetti. I think I'll use the little \"rice\" balls in soup. I recommend these. I am only giving them 5 stars because they are obviously not pasta, but for what they are, they are great. :)\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\n Royal Oak Gourmet Jumbo Virginia Salted Peanuts, 40-Ounce Holiday Christmas Tins (Pack of 2) \nReview:\nI have a serious nut addiction, granted peanuts aren't really nuts, but if they're crunchy and salty that's pretty much good enough for me. These are both crunchy and salty, they are big and you can see where the oil has bubbled on the surface of some of them. Some of them crunch with a soft crunch like a macadamia and then kind of melt and some of them CRACK and almost shatter in your mouth, some are just plain old peanutty and crunchy...the textures and taste and crunch crunch crunchy goodness make these a delight. Now are they way better than Planters or any other peanut, I honestly couldn't tell you, I don't buy peanuts. I'm generally low carb and eat other more low carb nuts, like pecans, macadamias, almonds, etc...but I bought these on a whim and now they are nearly gone. Five pounds of peanuts in a VERY short period of time, consumed in mass quantities, by the addict. Peanut crack. Buy some, buy them all, keep me from being able to order more...now, to buy some macadamias!\n\nUPDATE: I was going to order more but today on 9/12/13 these peanuts officially cost around 8 dollars more than when I bought them last, less than a year ago. HOLY SMOKES!! What is going on with Peanuts, or is it just Royal Oak, too bad, I was going to order more. :( I can't justify a rise in price of over 25% in less than a year.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It's nutty, chewy and tastes good.  I don't even add salt.\n\nOne caveat is to let it cook for longer than the package calls for, and add a bit more water.  After 20 minutes, it's still pretty soupy, but 30 minutes gives the perfect texture. For two servings, I use 1/2 cup oats to 1 1/2 cups of water, bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat and cook for 30 minutes.  I usually add one T of brown sugar and a handful of dried blueberries, dried cranberries or raisins to the water before cooking.  The moisture plumps the dried fruit beautifully and the sugar adds just a hint of sweetness. Slosh on some low fat milk and it's good to go.  This is the perfect breakfast food!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMarlo's Bakeshop Gluten-Free Soft-Baked Biscotti, Banana Bread, 5 Ounce\nReview:\nWhile there's definitely some banana bread flavor in these biscotti, they aren't wonderful.  They don't have the density of true biscotti, and they're very crumbly.  The one I just ate tasted like a slice of dry, almost stale banana bread made from a mix.\n\nIf you are on a gluten free diet, they might be satisfying bits of sweet, but speaking as a dedicated cookie eater, I'm not a fan of these.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nBob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa, 26 Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)\nReview:\nQuinoa is the most user-friendly grain I've ever found.  It cooks in the same amount of time and same liquid to solid ratio as white rice, but it has a flavor and a little crunch that's not as bland as rice.  Cook it in water or broth; add some sauteed onion and garlic or some ratatouille and it's a wonderful quick lunch.  Serve it as a bed for salmon or chicken and it's an equally delicious and fast dinner.\n\nBob's Red Mill Quinoa is my first experience with this ancient grain, and I'll be a fan for life.  Although I've read that quinoa should be washed before cooking to eliminate a bitter flavor, I've not had to do that with this brand.  It does have a bitey quality, but I happen to like it.  Even my meat and potatoes husband likes quinoa!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nJuicy Fruit Starburst Strawberry Sugarfree Gum, 15 piece,10 Count\nReview:\nI love Starbursts.

We're SO pleased!\n\nYes, it's a blend (what did you expect for the price?), but the mellow smoothness of the Kona really comes through and makes for an outstanding pot of coffee.  Without the almost-bitter notes of the Fogbuster, this Kona blend is complex, rich and delicious.\n\nFor a 12 cup drip coffeemaker, I use two and a quarter coffee scoops of the beans and grind for 15 seconds.  It's perfect, and way better than Maxwell House or Folgers.  Highly recommended!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nPeanut Butter &amp; Co. Chocmeister Hazelnut Spread, Milk Chocolatey, 13 Ounce Jar\nReview:\nI could sit down with this jar and a spoon and eat the whole thing.  It's delicious.  I love the combination of hazelnuts and dark chocolate, and the back off on sugar is exactly to my taste.  The dark grittiness of the cocoa comes through, the hazelnut gives it richness, and it's not overpoweringly sweet.\n\nBy no means is this stuff good for you!  A serving size is two tablespoons at 200 calories with half of those from fat.  Maybe it does have bumped up protein, but I still got sugar jitters from the spoonful I couldn't keep myself from devouring right out of the box it arrived in,  This won't be a breakfast spread for me, but I'm going in search of some coconut macaroons to serve as its vehicle for a totally decadent Sunday afternoon snack.\n\nI'm rating it in terms of its flavor, not for its implied healthiness.  That is simply misleading.  This is a fat laden sweet treat, and I love it!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nIndus Organic Authentic Indian Curry Powder Spice (Medium Hot), 8 Oz, Salt Free, Freshly Packed\nReview:\nThrough years of trial and error, I've learned I don't like curries with cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg.  They give dishes a dessert-y dimension I find unpleasant.  I've been searching for the perfect blend and this is it!  It's hot, curry-ish and delicious.  I've experimented with using it in salad dressing, chicken salad, and deviled eggs and it's the perfect blend for my taste.  There's no aftertaste and no funky cookie flavor.\n\nMy only quibble is the \"mild\" description.  This curry is quite spicy, and I love it.  Though it's branded as Authentic Indian Curry Powder, this would make a great base for Chinese, Japanese and Jamaican curries as well.\n\nSince my primary interest is flavor, I'm not that much concerned with organic spices, but I do appreciate that it's salt free, which makes it versatile.

The answer is Quaker Instant Oatmeal. The Maple Brown Sugar is really good... Almost as good as the stuff that leaves the mess in the pot, but if you want something more comforting and satisfying on a cold morning, I recommend going for Quaker Instant Oatmeal. We've been using it for years, and really appreciate the convenience of free delivery from Amazon!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nMcCANN'S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Sugar Free Maple &amp; Brown Sugar Flavor, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIf you're looking for taste and convenience, you can't go wrong with McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal. The Maple and Brown Sugar Flavor is really good. It cooks quickly in the microwave for a healthy breakfast (or midnight snack) that could lower your cholesterol. You don't really have to add anything to it, but half of a banana is a great addition to the maple flavor.\n\nGood product!\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nQuaker Chewy Variety Pack 60 Granola Bars (Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip), 50.7OZ\nReview:\nDon't hold back on purchasing this variety pack! This is a moist and chewy granola bar that can kill that raging appetite for only about 100 calories. I take these to work with me and when I see everyone else devouring the cookies on the break room table, I have one of these with a cup of coffee or tea and I'm fine 'till diner!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nQuaker Chewy Granola Bars, 25% Less Sugar Variety Pack, 18 Bars, Net Wt. 15.2 oz\nReview:\nWe subscribe to these on Amazon because of the high quality and great taste. I've never had a problem with freshness here or in the big box stores. The convenience of delivery is great, of course. Reduced sugar and variety pack makes this great for everyone, and it's certainly a step up from candy. Take them to work and save yourself from the garbage in vending machines!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nQuaker Instant Oats Variety Pack, 48-Count\nReview:\nNo negatives here! This is just about perfection in a bowl -- or coffee cup. No time for breakfast at home is not a problem. You can have a yummy hot breakfast at work or anywhere you can find some hot water. Sometimes I'll pour in a little coffee to give the brown sugar flavor a little extra zip. We've even used it for a simple lunch at work, and people have commented that it smells as though someone is baking home-made muffins.\n\nFor convenience and nutritional value, you really can't beat Quaker Instant Oatmeal, and the price of the variety pack with free shipping makes it all the better.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nFruity Cheerios Gluten Free Breakfast Cereal, 12 oz\nReview:\nCheerios Fruity Cereal has much more of a fruit flavor than other kids' cereal. The overpowering artificial candy taste that makes me crings is missing, along with some of the sugar. Kids and adults will like it. While it's not a \"health\" cereal, it is better than other brands of flavored breakfast food.\n\nIt also tastes pretty good out of the box, so a little in a zip-lock snack baggie makes it the perfect sweet snack for work or school.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSmuckers Sugar Free Breakfast Syrup, 14.5 Oz (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nI couldn't find this anywhere but on Amazon! This is the absolute best pancake syrup that is sugar free -- ever. The taste and texture will not disappoint. We really do not like diet syrup, but Smuckers Syrup tastes just like the real thing. Most definitely give it a try if you have been missing out on a little sweetness with your breakfast!\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It's \"okay\" and we \"like it\" is the best we can say about the meatloaf. The mashed potatoes suck. I chuck those and make my own (Honest Earth instant is WAY better than this quickie mashie in this meal). I add a salad or sauteed veggies, and divide the two loaves: a meal for two pretty fast.\n\nI hate molding/dealing with raw meat, so when I get a meatloaf craving, I go to Boston Market or I keep this in the fridge. This 16 oz size is fine for two if you add sides. (Trust me, the mashed potatoes are not worth the calories, and you're better off making your own or baking a couple taters or just having some veggies and crusty bread on the side.)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nExplore Cuisine Fettuccini, Organic Edamame &amp; Mung Bean, 8 Oz (Pack Of 6)\nReview:\nFirst off, if you like a bit of an earthy taste to your noodles, this will work fine for you. If you are expecting it to be like wheat or rice or corn pasta--not so much.\n\nI liked the simplicity of ingredients (mung beans + water) and the very high fiber (11 grams per serving), plus lower carb and higher protein than regular grain pastas. I figured I'd take a risk. Know what? I like these.\n\nBecause some reviewers had used the term earthy--rightfully so--I boiled up a batch (raw vegans can just soak them for a day). I sauteed artichoke hearts and fresh mushrooms in EVOO and garlic, then just tossed in these noodles and added parmesan. Very nice. I enjoyed them a whole lot. I cooked them till they were al denter and I like the chewiness of the texture.  I will be trying these with pesto and red pepper sauce, too.\n\nA very pleasant surprise. I like em. I won't say they are like real pasta. They are simply a different sort of noodle for folks who enjoy that, and I do.\n\nIf you aren't sure if it's for you, just order ONE from some vendor. Don't buy this huge quantity.\n\nOh, you can eat these raw as a snack with a dip. My sister and I tried them raw before I cooked up some. We both agreed they were kinda interesting uncooked--crunchy. They might work fine for folks who can digest these okay raw.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nSpecial K Crustless Quiche (Ham &amp; Cheese), 7 Oz (Frozen)\nReview:\nReally yummy. Smallish size, add toast and fruit or make a sandwich out of it. I sometimes, if tired, have this with sliced tomatoes and a fruit smoothie for dinner. I like this one a bit more than the portabella one, but I have to say the ease of this frozen breakfast item is terrific. A couple mins in the microwave and DONE. I hope they make more flavors. However, they really need to rethink the price. For how tiny these quiche \"patties\" are, five bucks plus for 2 of them is insane. I'd say these should cost in the neighborhood of 3.00 for the box, certainly no more than 4.00. $5.19 is a bit nuts and is the only impediment to my buying more quantities.\n\nUpdate: I've been making breakfast sandwiches for days with this (had to order more). Ezekiel bread, toasted, slice of cheese melted onto toast, one slice of Virginia ham. That's 8 grams of fiber for the sandwich,  about 400 cals, very filling and delicious.  (Tomato and fruit on the side). I gotta keep this one stocked.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nLean Cuisine, Craveables, Margherita Pizza, 6 oz (Frozen)\nReview:\nIf it's a choice between no pizza or this lower calorie pizza: skip pizza.\n\nThe crust is gross. The toppings skimpy (as one expects in lower calorie). The flavor missing. This is a failure of a pizza.\nYou're better off buying pizza sauce with good flavor and low-fat cheese and getting a pita and making a pita pizza in the oven, adding toppings.\n\nTo make this one bearable I added garlic, mushrooms, and extra cheese. I also baked it a while in the oven to try and improve the crust. It helped marginally, but this pizza is so awful, that even with all those additions, it was unsatisfactory.\n\nNope. Can't recommend this.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nLean Cuisine Favorites Swedish Meatballs - Frozen Meal with 16g of Protein and No Artificial Flavors, Delicious Frozen Meal, Ready in Minutes (9.125 oz.)\nReview:\nThe meatballs are absolutely vile.

This can't be meatballs for humans!\"\n\nI do not get the good reviews. Unless I got the bad batch of all batches, this is some seriously nasty meat in them there meatballs. And the sauce was bland. Salty, but bland.\n\nWill never rebuy!!!\n\nPlease, Amazon Fresh, get some good frozen homestyle meatballs we can heat up at home.

As a test, I did not tell my family it was made without wheat flour to see if they would notice.\n\nThe directions are simple and easy and I had it mixed up in a matter of minutes.  Into a muffin tin and baked for the amount of time specified on the packet and when i opened the oven, they looked perfect.  I pulled a couple out of the tin to serve my husband hot, with a dollop of butter and after he'd had them (a treat because I rarely bake), he stated that he could live on banana muffins and butter.  Only then did I tell him he flour is almond flour rather than wheat.  He had not been able to tell a difference and obviously, thoroughly enjoyed them.\n\nI have had them both hot and cold.

My daughter does not like and will not drink regular milk but she tried this and loves it.  Now she has one in her school lunch everyday and I feel good that she is getting the calcium/nutrition a young girl needs.

I would have to say I preferred the plain variety the best - I'm not much for flavored pancakes - but I feel I'm alone in this since the chocolate was the preferred mix with the kids.

You need to learn to work with cocoa to achieve maximum enjoyment.\nCocoa is bitter and a bit gritty.\nHow you proceed depends on your desired results.\nHot Chocolate is a good place to start. If you like the packets, then you want sweet and creamy. About 2 1/3 to 1 ratio of sugar to cocoa is about right.\nTry 2 tablespoons plus one teaspoon of sugar mixed with one level tablespoon of cocoa. One cup of hot (NOT boiling) milk and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, plus a dash of salt. Mix well in a mug and enjoy.\nHershey's is a good cocoa and a good value in this offering.\nCocoa can also be used in baking (brownies, chocolate/devil's food/mocha cake, for example,) and chocolate or fudge confections and candies.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBarilla Pronto Pasta, Half-Cut Linguine, 12 Ounce (Pack of 16)\nReview:\nBarilla Pronto is a new, interesting take on pasta. Use cold water, just enough to cover the pasta. Turn on the stove and allow the water to be absorbed. Just like steamed rice. No draining. Add sauce in the same pan and done. Voila! Quick-prep pasta al-dente.\nA great concept and quite the time saver.\nThe package directions assume you are preparing one whole box. If you want a different amount of pasta, you need to visit the Barilla web site for alternate instructions. A chart on the box would be more convenient and useful.\nFrom box to sauce-ready in just 10 minutes. Quick, convenient and tasty.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S Kisses Chocolate Candy, Baby Shower Pink&quot;It's A Girl&quot;, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nIf you are traditional, (boys=blue, girls=pink) Hershey's has a treat for you. Milk chocolate Kisses, wrapped in pink or blue foil. The same Kisses that have been satisfying your chocolate cravings for decades, now in lovely wrappers to highlight your buffet table or gift bags. They are small enough to indulge every once in a while, yet big enough to enjoy their chocolate goodness. Rich, sweet and affordable; the three pound bag is ideal for parties (or if you're feeling REALLY depressed.)\nThe light pink and blue colors are also great for Easter and other festive occasions, not just your baby parties. (However, the \"flags\" say \"It's a boy/It's a girl\", so they may not be appropriate for other parties, but when you need chocolate, do you really care?)\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nKellogg's Nutri-Grain, Soft Baked Breakfast Bars, Assorted Pack, 1.3oz (48 count)\nReview:\nNutri-Grain cereal bars are tasty snacks that are not totally devoid of nutritional value.

This is not the same Dubble Bubble gum any more.\nThe flavor is nice, for a few seconds. Then, nothing. The pieces are also too small to blow bubbles. You need to chew two to three pieces to get a decent bubble.\nMaybe I should look for Bazooka Joe?

Chocolate, all by itself is bitter.  And Stevia is super sweet and also bitter.  So the combination of these two ingredients creates an intense DARK CHOCOLATE that is very bitter-sweet.  Not a product for beginners, but very good for those who are accustomed to and appreciate the bitter notes of true chocolate and the super bittersweet flavor of stevia.\n\nChocolate has the potential to be a healthy superfood when it is consumed correctly - meaning that sugar and milk are not a part of the mix.  When chocolate candy is created, sugar and milk are added to tone down the bitterness of the chocolate.  But when people struggle with health issues, sugar is sometimes not an option, and often milk is also not an option.  Furthermore, milk negates the health benefits of chocolate.  According to the University of Michigan Health System, \"Milk binds to antioxidants in chocolate making them unavailable; therefore, milk chocolate is not a good antioxidant source.  To get the benefits of antioxidants, avoid drinking milk with dark chocolate.\"  (I would cite my source but Amazon doesn't allow links in their reviews.  Just google the terms, dairy and chocolate antioxidants, and the very first article should be the one I am referring to.)  In other words, to get the health benefits of chocolate, you must consume it without sugar and without dairy.\n\nI really like the simplicity of the Dante's ingredient list:  Chocolate Liqueur, Stevia, Pure Vanilla.  98% Cocoa.  And as a diabetic, I am in love with the fact that there is no sugar in the mix.  With this kind of list, the bitter taste is impossible to avoid.  So - if you hate bitter, then don't try this.  But if you like a simple, healthy, exotic and sophisticated dessert, then this might just be right up your alley.\n\nYou must also understand that this in not a low calorie food.  Even without sugar, there are still 260 calories per 45 gram bar AND 12 grams of carbohydrate.  Most of the calories in the Dante bar come from chocolate's high quality fat.  Compare to a Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate bar which is 190 calories per 41 gram bar and 25 grams of carbohydrate (the carbs are mostly from sugar).  This isn't about low calorie, low fat or low carb.  It is about the health benefits of pure chocolate and NO dairy or sugar - which is great news for diabetics who are open to new taste sensations.\n\nThis stevia sweetened chocolate is SO intense that you might not be able to eat more than one tiny square at a time.  This is where you will save on calories, fat and carbs - this chocolate is so satisfying that you will eat less and your cravings will be satisfied to the extent that binging will become a thing of the past.  Or if straight chocolate is too much for you, then you can grate it and sprinkle it on top of a whipped coconut cream mousse for a touch of chocolatey flavor without the dairy and sugar.  There are lots of things you can do with this, but be aware that this will NEVER taste anything remotely like a Hershey's candy bar.  Do not buy this thinking you will be able to make that switch because the two do not really compare.  It is better to realize that the bitterness inherent in both the chocolate and the stevia is to be appreciated and not avoided.  If you can come to terms with that, you might end up being one of those people who LOVE Dante's Stevia Chocolate.  If not, you will hate it.\n\nSo - I am giving the 4 stars - deducting one star because I was unable to confirm that the chocolate used is organic and non-GMO.  But for a simple, nutrient rich, sugar free chocolate rush - I think the Dante is wonderful!  However I am a long time Stevia user and am used to the taste of stevia.  And, my husband and I are both used to eating 100% UNSWEETENED chocolate and we weren't surprised at the bitterness.

It might have been in some of the delicious food, but since I never cooked while I was there, I am not sure if I ate it during my stay or not.  I probably did and never knew it, but since I don't know, I cannot compare what I tasted there to this product.\n\nI think this tastes akin to a very strong olive oil.  I prefer a lighter tasting oil, but I cannot say that this strong taste indicates a rancid flavor or if it is simply how Argan oil is supposed to taste.  I suspect that it's supposed to taste like this - I know what a rancid oil is like and this doesn't taste rancid to me.  Just really, REALLY strong.  When you put it in a dish, be sure to know that the flavor will overpower everything else.  I do have some real experience with exceptionally good quality extra virgin olive oil, and in my experience, the best olive oils do not have this intense,  unpleasant flavor.\n\nThis product gets 4 stars from me because of the vitamin E content.  I bought this because I am allergic to wheat and since wheat is a major source of vitamin E in the American diet, my levels were getting low.  Then I found out that Argan oil is even richer in vitamin E than wheat and my problem was solved.  Since I don't like the taste in cooking, I just take a teaspoon every day along with my disgusting cod liver oil and other supplements.  It does the trick.\n\nJust to make sure I have a really fresh Argan oil, I am planning to buy a different brand next time so I will have a basis for comparison.  If I find that Argan oil is always this strong in flavor, I'll come back and give this item 5 stars instead of 4.  If I find that I like other brands better, I come back and reduce my rating to 3 stars.  If I realize that this Argan oil is rancid, I'll come back and change my 4 stars to 1 star.  I might even take it to a local Moroccan restaurant and ask the owners to taste test it and give me a knowledgable opinion.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nNative Forest Organic Premium Coconut Cream, Unsweetened, 5.4 Ounce (Pack of 12)\nReview:\nUPDATE - June 4, 2017:  Since writing the above review, I have discovered that Thai Kitchen has some questionable additives and I have switched to Natural Value Coconut Milk. I just pour off the water to get 100% Cream. And this brand does seem to have a generous amount of cream in the can, with absolutely NO additives.

It was supposed to be CREAM for goodness sake, but when I opened this can there was hardly any cream in the can.  The contents were grayish and watery.  There wasn't enough cream in this to make it worth anything.  I would rather buy Thai Kitchen coconut milk, which is pure white, FULL OF CREAM, and a rich milky water that is great for smoothies or soups.\n\nI am not sure how they define CREAM, but I feel like I got mostly water from this can.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\nMiracle Noodle Shirataki Zero Carb, Gluten Free Fettuccini, 7 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nA quick look at the reviews of this product shows that people are divided as to whether this is a guilt free pasta dream come true or whether this is a nasty, smelly, slimy nightmare.  And I fall solidly into the \"Dream Come True\" camp.\n\nAs a person with miltiple food allergies and type 2 diabetes, my diet had become a bland, monotinous string of meat and vegetables.  I don't like \"fake\" food and so I had opted out of substitutes like fake cheese, low carb bread, and artificial sweeteners.  Then I ran across these noodles (my doctor carries a line of low carb foods in his office), and decided that I would try them once, even if I probably wouldn't ever want to eat them again.\n\nI am really glad I tried them.  I like the texture, and the taste is so bland that they quickly soak up any flavor that is cooked into them.  The initial odor coming out of the package is kind of \"fishy\", but that goes away quickly as the noodles are prepared and they absorb the flavors and aromas of the foods they are cooked with.  The texture is slippery, stretchy, and chewy - kind of like I remember real pasta being.  Some reviewers said that they didn't like the \"slimy\" texture, but I didn't find it to be any slimier than real pasta.  In any case, it didn't bother me at all\n\nI started with spaghetti and meatballs, then I had buttered noodles, and then I had noodles with taco meat and a yummy mexican sauce with olives and avacado.  Then there was my allergen free version of Pad Thai.  The list goes on and on and I have never failed to love whatever I have used them in.  AND my blood sugar stays within the normal range!\n\nI tried several shape varieties, and I like the fettuccini noodles the best for pasta because they have substance.  I like the shiratake rice as a rice substitute.  I used the \"fake rice\" for a stuffed zucchini dish that was to die for - my whole family dove in and raved for more!  Shiratake noodles are now a part of my diet and long term lifestyle, and I have enrolled in the Subscribe and Save program because I use them so often.\n\nShiratake noodles are something a person either loves or hates, and there doesn't seem to be much in between, so I recommend that anyone who isn't sure and wants to try it once should buy from the Miracle Noodle website because they accept returns if you don't like the product.  If you like them, you can then purchase from Amazon, but first time users should buy directly from the manufacturer.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

It is vegan, gluten-free, bpa-free, organic & verified non gmo.\n\nThe taste is superb.  I tasted the mango and coconut.  Also, there are small coconut flakes, which make it that much better, and give it texture.  I love coconut flakes.\n\nI love products such as these.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nRaw Rev 100, Chocolate &amp; Coconut 100 Calorie Organic Live Food Bar, 0.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 26)\nReview:\nTo me, chocolate and coconut is pure heaven.

It is versatile; depending on how you season it depends on how it turns out.  For example, it can be seasoned with lemon, pepper, garlic, basil, etc.  It can also be seasoned with brown sugar.\n\nI am not going to write a long review; the grain itself is versatile enough to make it just about any way you want.  And it's easy to prepare.  And it's healthful (I'll get into that in the next paragraph).\n\nFrom what I'd heard about the grain, it is \"old\", \"strong\", \"healthy, \"wise\" (even has built up a coating that is a resistance to insects).  This grain intrigues me; I plan to look up its history.\n\nQuinoa (which I recently found out) is what dieticians call a \"complete protein\".  Other than meat products, there aren't a lot of \"complete proteins\" that I know of, other than soy.  I do not eat soy.  So I thought I'd give this product a try.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLipton Black Iced Tea Bags, Cold Brew Decaffeinated Family Size,22 Count,4.8 Oz (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nThis tea is perfect for me, especially since I don't boil my tea, anyway.  I just let it seep out of the bags into the water.  I put the bags in the gallon jugs, and let it set there in the refridgerator.  And I love the taste of this tea.\n\nI do usually drink decaffeinated tea, as the caffeinated versions keep me up really late.  I wish I had of known about this back in the day when I had to pull all-night duty.  Back then, I did not know that caffienated tea did this to me.  I tried coffee to keep me perky all night, but it did nothing for me.\n\nI love tea.  This particular type of tea tastes really good to me.  And I love cornbread and iced tea.  That is a combination that goes good together for some reason.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nBlue Diamond Natural Oven Roasted Almonds Vanilla Bean, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nThese nuts are heavenly in more ways than one.  For one, all nuts are healthy.  Almonds are especially heathful.  For two, the taste is out of this world.  It is an almond taste with a smooth vanilla background.  If you like both almonds and vanilla, then you will be in heaven.\n\nLucky for me, I am a nut lover.  I am lucky to love something so healthy.  And the vanilla background of these nuts make them a very healthy and tasty snack; they are so good, it is hard to believe that they are healthy.\n\nAlmonds are good for the heart, as well as other organs.  Even though raw nuts, I'm sure, are healthier than cooked nuts, I do sometimes include nuts in different recipes.  However, I would never include these vanilla almonds in any recipe, because I would be afraid that the vanilla might come off.  I only eat these raw.\n\nThis is a very healthy snack.  Highly recommended.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nLate July Organic Dark Chocolate Sandwich Cookies,  8.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nI was attracted to this box of cookies because of the \"brand\". \"Late July\" sounds like a wonderful brand name, and late July does bring back wonderful memories for me: it sounds like a fish fry with homemade french-fried potatoes and cole slaw and hush puppies, an ice bucket, iced tea, a cool breeze blowing from the fan, a porch, and lots of love. That's what I thought of when I saw this brand. Also, it is natural and therefore, vegans can have this product.\n\nVanilla bean with green tea:  The cookies didn't taste good. The flavor idea was pretty good. There was a hint of good flavor. Vanilla bean with green tea sounds wonderful. Possibly, the bad taste was due to all the soy and soy products used.  I managed to eat this whole box (of vanilla bean with green tea) without throwing any out.\n\nDark chocolate:  Horrible.  I couldn't even finish the whole box; I had to throw out most of it.  (And I'm the queen of conservativeness.)  The \"dark\" chocolate was so dark and so horrible, that it was too much for even a chocolate lover.  The chocolate had a horrible taste.  Not to mention the horrible taste it left in your mouth.  (Possibly too much soy, and whatever was in that chocolate.)  I literally had to go and buy some lemons and ate two, and also some potato chips, just to get that taste out of my mouth.\n\nNever again.\nRating:\n1.0\nProduct:\ngoodnessKNOWS Cranberry, Almond &amp; Dark Chocolate Gluten Free Snack Square Bars 18-Count Box\nReview:\nOne star is missing:\n\n1- Soy lecithin is listed in the ingredients.\n\n2- Milkfat is listed in the ingredients.\n\nThe bars aren't all bad:\n\n1- There are several good ingredients, such as berries, almonds, honey.\n\n2- They taste good.\n\n3- Each \"bar\" is divided into four squares.\n\n4- They are non-GMO.\nRating:\n4.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

I took one star off for the added salt & sugar, but I understand that most people do not want to eat things as tart as I like, nor do they want to buy a bunch of separate items, and then have a bulk supply sitting around.

I believe they sell them with pistachios, but those aren't very good. It's easy enough to grab a couple of walnut halves with a piece of the candy and eat them together; the pieces are small enough to do that.

Bag\nReview:\nThese may last forever at 1T every day in my morning shake since I'm having trouble finding recipes for other ways to use these seeds, but they will keep (in a sealed plastic container).\nUPDATE: Figured out the best use of these seeds for ME--I love salad with 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds and am now adding 2 tablespoons chia seeds, too. This way I get lots of crunch, different textures and a REALLY filling meal. I've been eating very low-carb (20 grams or less/day) for about 9 months now and have lost 30 lbs. But, at that low level of carbs, even using them all on vegetables and drinking jugs and jugs of water can still leave a constipation problem. These seeds fixed that immediately even as they facilitated eating less and feeling more satisfied. Miracle food is REAL.

We found the grind was course and uneven. We found the coffee completely dry (freshly ground coffee has indices of moisure being present when fresh and then ground). The uneven grind would mean uneven results, and we like to grind our own using a burr grinder which not only gives a consistent granularity; it does it without overheating (recooking) the bean as some grinding processes do. We have no way of knowing, but we think it was old. So it wasn't to our liking, we thru out 2 new bags and the partrtial we had opened.

As for the fortune, it's typical of what is given out these days. I used math and logic in my working life and the notion that one slip of paper can deliver a unique verbal prediction for you and a winning lottery number just can't travel together (if you hold any store in those fortune slips anyway).  The two diverse things on the slip are contradictory, if one's correct the other one can't be correct, but it's all in fun so why take a fortune cookie serious?

So many other more satisfying sugar-free treats out there for a fraction of the price.\nRating:\n2.0\nProduct:\nHERSHEY'S Chocolate Syrup, Dessert Topping/Beverage Syrup, Sugar-Free, 17.5 Ounce (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nSo good. When you get that chocolate craving, this curbs it. Great in ice cold milk or whipped with cream for dipping strawberries.\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nTorani Caramel Sauce, 16.5 Ounce\nReview:\nPerfect for so many things. Purchased for the holiday coffee bar so my guests can use this in their coffee, hot cockails, and cocoa. But it is so delicious and rich and has such a beautiful color and texture, I can see this drizzled on cheesecake, ice cream, waffles, used as a fruit dip, etc. The best part is it's real caramel instead of artificially flavored syrup. I also love the mess-free spout cap/squeeze bottle combo. The bottle itself is also attractive, so it looks nice on the coffee bar.\n\nGlad I found this on Amazon Prime!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nDeruyter Chocoadehagel Puur (Dark Chocolate Sprinkles), 14-Ounces Boxes (Pack of 3)\nReview:\nHeavenly! I'm sure glad I found these. After reading the reviews and having several customers answer my questions, I ordered some. They are, as promised, delicious! Very genuine dutch chocolate flavor. These worked great for topping and coating holiday treats like chocolates, truffles, and boozie-balls. The sprinkles added a lovely flavor and texture. They kept their firm shape and created a nice visual finish. I've used them sprinkled on cake frosting, whipped cream, and even cookie icing, which looks and tastes amazing. As an experiment, I tried to bake with them. While they melt beautifully at a lower heat, they don't do well at high heat, so use baking chips instead. DeRuijter Chocolate Sprinkles are perfect as is!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nSweetLeaf Sweet Drops Liquid Stevia Sweetener, Chocolate, 2 Ounce (Pack of 2)\nReview:\nI absolutely LOVE SweetLeaf Chocolate liquid! I've added it to my low carb cheesecake, brownies, smoothies, shakes. If your recipe already calls for sugar substitute and chocolate, A small amount of SweetLeaf Chocolate will punch up both the richness of the chocolate and the sweetness of the sugar substitute. Try a few drops in a glass of milk for a chocolate milk that tastes so much better than the sugar-free version of the big-name syrup. If you like your chocolate milk rich with a nice chocolate color, here's a tip: stir a half teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa with a few drops of SweetLeaf Chocolate into 12 oz of cold milk. The cocoa won't mix with the milk very well, but if you put the milk in the fridge for 20 minutes, the cocoa will become saturated and will then stir into the milk with a spoon just like the syrup! Bob's your uncle!\n\nThis is a very authentic chocolate flavor that is actually complimented somewhat by the slight bitterness of the stevia, giving it the depth of dark chocolate. I cannot wait to make no sugar chocolate whipped cream in my cream gun!\n\nNow I'm going to have to try a few more flavors!\nRating:\n5.0\nProduct:\nKeebler&nbsp;Cookies, Simply Made,&nbsp;Chocolate Chip, 10 oz Tray\nReview:\nYes, Keebler! Please keep making products like this! I stopped buying and eating \"store-bought\" cookies years ago because of the horrible ingredients - partially hydrogenated vegetable fats, artificial vanillin, etc. Simply Made chocolate chip cookies have a delightful flavor. They're rich and buttery with a delicately crispy texture, not hard and dry like most other store-bought cookies. The chocolate chips are plentiful and decent quality. They melt in the mouth like they should instead of being hard little burnt bits. The chocolate chips are pretty high in cocoa percentage, so they are strong-flavored with a slightly roasted aftertaste. If you're used to the anemic, overly-sweet, vanillin-flavored chocolate bits in other store-bought chocolate chip cookies, these may taste a bit different to you.\n\nWhile they're not exactly \"home made\" tasting, they are far and away the best store-bought cookies I've had in a very long time. I wish I could give Keebler extra stars for making baked goods with wholesome ingredients (real sugar, real butter, coconut oil) instead of corn sweeteners and partially hydrogenated fats.\n\nEdit: I think the \"burnt\" taste people are commenting on might be just the browning. Real butter will take on a slightly nutty taste (beurre noisette). It's a unique flavor but a sign that real butter is being used. Many people prefer this taste to the flavorless, greasy shortenings normally used in store-bought cookies. Additionally, since they use real sugar instead of fructose corn syrup, browning occurs at a different temp, which may add to the complexity of flavors of baked goods.\nRating:\n5.0\n</similarpairs>\nNow you will receive features shedding light into how you use words and formulate sentences:\n<features>\n\n</features>\nFinally, you will receive product-review pairs from other customers to help you distinguish your style from others.\n<otherwriters>\n\n</otherwriters>\nUsing the features, generate the proper review.

Perfect for children's small hands and stomachs, but too small to quench the hunger of an adult.\n\nI enjoyed the combination of berries and applesauce, but was a little put-off by its ultra fine texture. It reminded me of baby food. But I can see why they have it that way, seeing as how the neck of the pouch is very small - they don't want it to clog. The screw top lid is a nice touch, kids can eat part and throw the rest in their lunch box without fear that it will spill.\n\nI think kids will like the idea of squeezing it out like toothpaste.\n\nA tip for parents: The first pack opened very easily for me, but the second one didn't. It was a struggle to snap it free. With this in mind, you might want to go ahead and loosen the caps if you put this in lunch boxes for small kids.\nRating:\n3.0\nProduct:\nSwiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix, Sensible Sweets, Light, 8 count,0.29 ounce, (Pack of 6)\nReview:\nBut drinking a lot of milk and chocolate mixed with sugar has its negative health side. During the winter I like hot drinks and the Swiss Miss diet drink is very satisfying. I can taste the sucralose (substitute for sugar) and that is a slight reduction in enjoyment. Also I notice the thinness of the drink compared to regular milk. So I rate it 4-4.5 stars.\nRating:\n4.0\nProduct:\nBarilla Whole Grain Spaghetti, 13.25 oz(Pack of 10)\nReview:\nLike a lot of people I have to limit my intake of white flour.

I drink my regular tea and Chinese tea straight. I've enjoyed sampling these Lipton fruit flavored teas. The flavor is more pronounced when I steep it for several minutes with a little honey added. The blackberry really was distinct in this tea. Lipton should take the pomegranate name off and just make a pure pomegranate tea.

I like to add some plain oatmeal to the bowl to create more volume to fill me up and make it less sweet. One of my tricks to keep it from overflowing the bowl in the microwave is to let it stand in the water for a couple of minutes while I prepare my coffee. The water absorbs into the oatmeal.
