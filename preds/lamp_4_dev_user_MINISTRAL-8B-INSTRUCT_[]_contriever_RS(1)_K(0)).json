Now righteous populism must face economic, financial and political realities if other European states don't bend Greece's way.\n\nTo keep up with the drama as it evolves over the coming weeks, we've connected WorldPost readers directly to the daily blog of Yanis Varoufakis, the self-described \"erratic Marxist\" who is now Greece's finance minister. Writing from Athens, HuffPost Greece Editorial Director Sophia Papaioannou says Alexis Tsipras' electoral victory will give suffering Greeks \"space and time\" to address their predicament. Former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou argues that the path forward after the election is for a national referendum on a \"Greek plan\" for reform that will bind a now polarized nation. Rena Dourou, a deputy of the victorious Syriza party, notes that the vote was as much against the corruption of the formerly ruling political parties in Greece as it was against austerity.

They are the victims of yet another suicide bombing by the self-proclaimed Islamic State in the wake of Turkey's decision last July to allow U.S. warplanes to fly from its soil to attack militant positions in Syria.

Just as Chinese President Xi Jinping was due to arrive in South Korea -- which is angry at Japan over denials about World War II \"comfort women\" --  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a changed interpretation of the constitution that allows Japanese military forces to operate abroad. As Shannon Tiezzi  writes, China's approach is now aimed at exploiting differences within Japanese public opinion over Abe's new nationalism. From Australia, John Garnaut  writes that an old idea of Colin Powell's is being raised anew: an alliance of democratic states in Asia to counter China's new influence.

Defiant to the end, the philosopher voluntarily drank the poison himself in a suicidal display of dignity.\n\nThis weekend, Greek voters will decide in a referendum whether they will be force-fed more painful austerity, imposed by the jury of other European democracies, or, like Socrates, administer their own poison in a \"no\" vote that will likely push Greece out of the eurozone. Tragedy, too, such as we are witnessing today, had its origins in early Greek drama.\n\nNobel Laureate Joe Stiglitz and Martin Guzman argue that Greece will be better off administering the poison by its own hand. As they point out by examining the Argentine default in 2001, there is \"life after debt and default.\" Manolis Glezos, the elderly firebrand of Syriza, writes from Athens that, in a democracy, \"the people are the measure\" of their fate.

But how does one define \"territory\" when media now crosses the boundaries of nations, cultures and civilizations?\n\nIn the end, free societies must defend the right of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists against murder by fanatics, the Sony filmmakers against the North Korean regime and novelists like Salman Rushdie against a fatwa from the ayatollahs. But isn't Pope Francis also right that, in today's diverse and connected world, we must exercise the civil restraint of \"respect\" for the non-fanatic faithful (see the other depiction of the Prophet acceptable among some Muslims on left above), even if we insist on irreverence toward political authority?\n\nFinding an equilibrium amid the frictions and fusions that abound in this global public space will determine whether or not we can forge a new cosmopolitan commons of the 21st century.\n\nThis week, The WorldPost engages this conundrum. Writing from Denmark, Flemming Rose, the Jyllands-Posten editor who commissioned cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad a decade ago that set off riots across the Muslim world, argues against \"the tyranny of silence\" fanatics would impose.

Soumaya Ghannoushi argues that the many years that activists from the moderate Islamist Ennahdha Party spent in exile abroad taught them \"the art of compromise and consensus, which may be the hallmark of the nascent Tunisian political model.\" Jonathan Labin, head of Middle East, Africa and Pakistan for Facebook, chronicles how the same social media that fomented political upheaval is now connecting young people in the region to jobs.

Not a leader to rest on the laurels of his country's remarkable success so far in rising to the top ranks of the global economy, Xi wants to leap over the \"middle-income trap\" in which development becomes stuck in a low-wage manufacturing export economy. To do that, he needs to avoid, in his own words, the \"Thucydides trap\" of conflict between China as a rising power and the U.S. as the established power so instability does not disrupt growth prospects.
