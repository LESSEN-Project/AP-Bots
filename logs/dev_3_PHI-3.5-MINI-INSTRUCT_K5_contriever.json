I'm using it because I haven't seen anything much better.\nScore:\n3\n\nReview:\nWorst thing I ever purchased on amazon.  So cheaply made you'd hesitate paying $10 for it at a discount store.  Cheap cloth on the front.  Hardly any padding.  Hanging brackets only hold if you never touch the board again--slightest movement makes it fall off the wall.  Bad smell.  I can't believe they had the nerve to charge almost $33 for this--or that I actually paid it!\nScore:\n1\n\nReview:\nThis is a beautifully made phone--quite heavy, not flimsy like most other \"traditional\" phones these days.  However, I only gave it 3 stars because even at its highest setting, the volume is much lower than my old, flimsy phone that was half the price.  But I'll keep this as it's simply a secondary phone that I use with MagicJack, mostly to call myself when Ii can't find my cell phone!  Maybe it's just this one phone, too, that has such low volume--but I don't care enough to send it back and get another one.  It's good enough.\nScore:\n3\n\nReview:\nWorks just as it's supposed to!  Very useful in my long, dark closet.  Will buy more.\n\nUPDATE  Used this about once a day since I purchased in November 2017.  Today the switch stopped working--just rocks back and forth without making any contact.  Since this was under $10 I guess I should have expected it, but I had a similar one that worked for more than 8 years before going bad and didn't cost much more than this.  i guess I'll try another brand this time.\nScore:\n2\n\nReview:\nThis is definitely a quality machine.  Whether it's worth the trouble of assembling, disassembling and cleaning the removable parts is a question of how much time you have, what you're using it for, etc.  I use it sometimes for my hard kitchen and bathroom floors but it doesn't replace an old-fashioned mop for getting into corners, along baseboards, etc.  However, I do use it regularly to \"spot-clean\" my very light carpeting and throw rugs.  Much easier than getting down on hands and knees to use a spray spot-cleaner, so I do it more often--my carpets look much nicer.  It actually pulls more cat hair and other debris out of my carpet than my regular upright vacuum does--but it means you have wet debris in the rollers and bin, which is a bit messy to clean out.\n\nOverall, this is a somewhat pricey investment considering it does not, for me, completely replace my regular mop or vacuum.  But I do use it often enough, and it seems sturdy enough, that I'm sure the cost will be worth it in the long run.  And my rugs do look very nice!\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Thankfully she felt sorry enough for me that she finally gave in, and Monday night I was sucked into the tumultuous romance of Lynch and Kat!  Ive been fortunate over the past year to have quite a few times to chat with Tory and she is just the sweetest thing ever confident, yet simultaneously questioning her writing and you expect these wonderfully sweet romances  right up to the point where you realize that Torys inner voice has a MOUTH on her!  LOL!  Anyway, if you want to check out more of her works, look below for the carousel that showcases a partial backlist  Tory writes contemporary, she has some paranormal/shifters, some heroes (SEALS, etc) and also a trio of brothers (Evans Security  what Im rereading now because I need some more of a Tory fix ).  Another way to check out some of her books?  Go to her webpage and in the top right hand side, input your email and sign up for her newsletter!\n\nOkay, on to the Wild Marauders.  During a shootout once of the bikers is wounded, so Prospect Chicken is sent to the towns clinic to get a doctor.  Instead, he gets a nurses aid / receptionist  Kat.  This is not the first time that Kat & Lynch have met, but it is the most combustible!  Lynch isn't an MC President with a warm and fuzzy side in private; hes hard, raunchy and unapologetic and while he likes Kats willingness to stand up to him, and won't tolerate it if it disrupts the club or her safety.  With the Red Devils upping their game to take over the Wild Marauder and Dark Menace MC territories, Kat becomes an unwilling pawn in the power struggle, and she and Lynch have to decide if their relationship is worth the risk.\n\nIve read many of Tory Richards stories before and they are definitely panty changers.  Not only can you get a good cardio workout from reading her books, but they (gasp!) also have a STORY to them!  (Double gasp!)  This is NOT a gratuitous sex scene to sex scene book, but delves into the lifestyle of an MC and has some suspense/mystery/danger in it to boot.  One thing I usually dislike about first books in a series is that the author is trying so hard to set up subsequent stories, and push character introductions, that the story is actually left dangling.  This is NOT the case in this Wild Marauders book; while you are introduced to the MC and some of its members, you don't get dragged under with multiple back-stories, and the introduction to the next book in this MC series is so subtle that it actually surprised me a bit when I saw in her newsletter that the next book would be about a friendly MCs President, Stone of the Dark Menace (you meet him in this book because his MC comes in to help a few times & vice versa).  While Wild Marauders is a standalone romance, the threat of the Red Devils MC remains and will make a nice arc suspense theme as the background for Stone & Rachels romance.\n\nThere are several litmus tests that I usually have with a first book that I read.  Do I have the urge to look & see what other books the authors had published so that I can read them?  (Since I already have many of them, I guess since Im rereading the brothers thats a PASS.)  Another is if I find myself hoping the next book in the series will release SOON, which leads me to a question for Tory   when will DARK MENACE  STONE be done so I can get a copy?  [wink]\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nDISCLAIMER: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an HONEST review. However, please note that since I realized it was third of a series, I did purchase the first two books to read so that I was familiar with the characters.\n\nFirst of all, don't be afraid to pick this book up -- you don't necessarily need to have read the prior two books in the \"Foul Ball\" series in order to understand &/or enjoy the book. It can easily be a standalone read. Secondly, don't be put off thinking you need to like/understand baseball in order to read this book. Baseball is more a \"setting\" for the book - and just as easily gambling could be used as the setting.\n\nCatriona McDaniel is back and working for the Soldiers, once again a team reporter and living with her fiance, Benji. You're introduced to her half-brother, Quinn, who is a shady McDaniel that creates a huge problem for Cat. This book exhibits similiar themes to the prior two -- greed is bad and the rich are overpriveleged. There are rants against ball player salaries; overconsumption by \"celebrities\" and Benji gets in a few more ecological points. But the basic of the book is a \"cozy mystery\" of what actually happened on Cat's balcony and how that ripples out into the rest of her life and the baseball playoffs. It's an enjoyable read, with a few cute little twists. I would have enjoyed the story much more if I hadn't thought too much about it (guess that's a downside to knowing you're going to review it -- instead of reading for enjoyment, you're reading it knowing you need to review it). I think the whole relationship with Benji REALLY bothers me. Between her \"dalliance\" in \"Curveball\" with Junior and her nightmares about getting married (& more than obvious reluctance to do so) I just couldn't believe the relationship. And what woman really thinks about if her ring is actually real 14K gold (& how in the world does a college professor afford a 2 carat diamond???)? The ending bothered me; she obviously did NOT want to go with him for a year and to end it with her looking longingly at Soldier Field... well, not sure if that is meant to let the reader guess that the engagement is doomed to fail, or if it was more of a \"I promise I'll be back\" situation.\n\nI did really like the family themes; family sticks together, etc... It was also great that Quinn returned in the end to save her. I thought that I had read this was a three book series, but I think it'd really be interesting to \"hear\" from Michael McDaniel (the father) if there is a future book...\n\nOverall, about a 3.8 star book (I rounded up) but it's a nice, easy read with some fun characters. Enjoy!\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\n4.5 stars!!\n\nIT'S A TRAP!\n\nDammit. Y'all know that serials PISS. ME. OFF. Guess what? \"WOLF BAIT is the first book in the Wolf Cove series\" does not, to me, translate to -- \"WOLF BAIT ends in a cliff hanger - so sorry\". I expected that it meant the author planned to then feature other staff from Wolf Cove. Plus, with the title, I thought there might have even been a surprise of a shifter going on and it just wasn't referenced in the blurb (by the way - NO, there is NOT). Imagine my pissed-offed-ness when I reached the end... &*@#$(!!!!!  By the way, don't be put off by the \"lot of sex\".  The main characters don't really have sex until about 90% of the way into the story, but before that there is an (overseen) lesbian scene and masturbation scene... so don't turn the book away thinking it is going to be filled edge to edge with smut.  It's not.\n\nWhat IS it filled with?  Not an ending.  Not even a HFN.  (Sorry - I hold a grudge.  Just think about how many times I've said that I'm still angry with Bella Jewel for beating me to a teary pulp at the end of SHADE.  See.  GRUDGE-HOLDER.)  This is the story of a church sheltered college junior who expects to graduate from her Christian college in a year, marry her childhood / neighbor sweetheart fiance who is the pastor's son, and give him her virginity on their wedding night.  Not that they haven't been tempted by some heavy make-out sessions, but Jed always held back.  Well, except for that time Abbi finds him balls deep in another girl...  So Abbi goes to the job fair & interviews for a summer hotel position at the newly opening \"Wolf's Cove Lodge\" in Alaska, and gets the call that she's gotten on staff.\n\nHer first night there she has her first drink, gets drunk, and runs into Mr. Wolf... and a fascination is born.  If you want to try to pigeonhole it, the Virgin / Billionaire trope probably works best.  There's a lot of subplot going on -- Henry Wolf is controlled by his father dangling control of the Wolf lodge chain in front of him, just as Abbi is controlled by her Mama's approval & fear of the Church teachings. (I'm assuming the second novel will take into account the amount of self-subjugation these characters are willing to endure for their goals!) It's also a novel of awakenings -- Abbi to owning her sexuality and independence, and Henry to balancing the lessons of his grandparents against the goals of his father.  There's also a little subtext in there about self-worth, and not accepting cheating from your significant other just to appease public opinion / community expectations.\n\nOriginally posted on SnarkyMomReads\nSnarky Mom's Scale of Awesomeness!

Its amazing what weird crap runs through your head while you're hopped up on Nyquil.\n\nAnyway, as usual, Entangled Publishing has a wonderful release here & I absolutely loved it!\n\nWhen flaky Las Vegas hairdresser Molly McLaren overhears a Russian hit man planning to kill a US congressman and take out Hoover Dam in the process, she becomes a target for murder. Now, on the run from the assassin and a dirty cop, she winds up in an eighteen wheeler with an ex-cop sporting a bum leg, a bad attitude, and a body built for loving.\n\nGrey Wilson just wanted to be left alone. No more Las Vegas. No more casinos. And no more floozy women like the one his best friend sent him to pick up on the side of the road. She talks fast, but her endless curves and sensuous nature make him want to slow down. Which is not in the cards. Grey knows he needs to unload his excess baggage. And quick. But when someone tries to kill the Vegas beauty, Molly captures his heart with her backbone of steel, and brains to boot. Now in order to grasp the future that had once seemed impossible, Molly and Grey need to keep Hoover Dam, the congressman, and their love from being blown sky-high.\n\nGrey and Molly realize that neither are what the other appears on the surface, and their love story develops as they run from the Russian mafia, dirty cops and suspicious task force members.  This was a great before bed read!\n\nNow, as for the weird sh! t that runs through my headand its not just THIS story, but romance stories overall.  Have you ever noticed how they ALWAYS seem to have condoms at the ready?  So here I am, all hopped up on Nyquil and all I can start thinking of are those coupon dispensers in grocery stores and how the men in romance novels seem to have the same thing going with their wallets.  I mean, take Grey.  I guess I can understand a guy always having a condom in his wallet.  What really cracks me up, however, is how its always mentioned that they grab for their pants & then you hear the crinkle of foil.  Really?  You just have a condom hanging loose in your pants pocket?  How long has it been in there and how many wash/dry cycles has it been through?  Do you REALLY want to USE that one??  On top of that, when you're on the run from the Russian mafia and people are shooting at you, WHEN are you taking the time to refill your condom stash?!!??  Me?  Id be more worried about staying alive than making a stop at the corner drugstore to pop in for condoms but thats just me.  Must be different for boys.  ??\n\nI know.  No more Nyquil for me.\n\nOriginally posted on Snarky Mom Reads.\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\nTEMPTATION'S EDGE\n\nWhen I chose to read & review (in exchange for a copy of the book) Temptation's Edge by Eve Berlin (aka Eden Bradley), the write-up that hooked me mentioned meeting an alpha-man at the wedding of a friend and having a brief fling.  Um, it's not really that, but at the same time, it is sooo much more!  First of all, be aware:  THIS HAS BDSM THEMES OUT THE WAZOO.  (And there is wazoo play, too.)  While Snarky Vanilla Mom isn't averse to reading BDSM themes, what almost did make me put down the Kindle was when the main male character proclaimed himself a sadist.  Yeah, that was going a bit too far for me out of my comfort zone.  However, I stuck with it, and I am glad I did!\n\nMischa leaves San Francisco to head to Seattle to help her friend, Dylan, plan her wedding, and also to meet up with a former colleague to partner up for a new tattoo shop.  (Apparently there are two prior stories to this one so Dylan's story was one of the prior ones - which if I'd known that, I'd have known more of what I was getting into reading.)  She meets Connor, an Irishman, and the attraction is instantaneous.  While Mischa is not unfamiliar with BDSM play, she's not as \"into it\" as Connor - so she has a bit of a learning curve to loosen up her control issues for the trust exchange inherent in BDSM.  While the sex scenes ARE smokin' hot, and Connor professes several times that he is a sadist, the \"scenes\" are pretty laidback compared to what they could have depicted (there was talk of hot wax, whips, etc... - but none of that happened in the book).  The story was more about the fact that from the age of six, Mischa had to be the parent in the family, and therefore has massive issues about giving up control and trust.  On the flip side, Connor suffers from fear he'll turn out like his abusive father, so he has massive issues about giving up control, trust and his ability to even love.\n\nTemptation's Edge is their story.  It's DEFINITELY one of those books you wouldn't want left up on your Kindle where the kids could read parts of it - 'cause quite frankly, I always thought that pinching was solely used for getting your kids' attention while out in public since you can't really whack `em upside the backs of their heads then -- so they'd just have even more things to snicker about if they read parts of it.  Don't let the heavy sex turn you away, either - it's actually tastefully done, again - SMOKIN' HOT, but it's not just a sex scene after scene book - there is actually a PLOT (gasp!).  You'll find your heart breaking right along with Mischa's and cheer on Connor when he steps off the cliff.

(Check her out here: [...] ) Her fourth in the series just came out a few days ago & I picked it up last night.  H.O.T. !!!  OMG!  So the title is \"Bases Loaded (Mustangs Baseball)\", and apparently it refers to a \"secret club\" that these FICTIONAL major league ballplayers have created, where there is a sexual challenge put forth to women who are invited to participate -- and the result for those who make it through all (4) bases is some jewelry pierced into some... um... personal spots.\n\nAnyway - this is the story of Antonio & Clare - Antonio is new to the Dallas Mustangs baseball club and Clare is a college music professor who moonlights as the baseball team's organist.  He catches sight of her at a fundraiser and realizes then & there that she is his soul-mate.  However, she is \"curvy\" and has massive self-esteem issues, so when he hits on her, she thinks he's being a bully & trying to humiliate her.  The resulting story is how he works through what he thinks are perverted needs for the woman who will bear his children, and she works through her body issues, as they fall in love.  Since it is the off-season, he has lots of free time in which to \"woo\" Clare.  The ultimate problem?  She wants to \"run the bases\" for his \"Bases Loaded\" sex club; he feels too possessive and they have constant clashes over this.  If you want to find out how it all shakes out... READ THE STORY!!!  (Disclaimer:  toy play, anal, m/m/m/f, light bondage.)\n\nOkay, so I'm always a vocalist about digital book pricing, so I will say that this is very well priced for the amount of pages it has - WELL worth the money!!!  This isn't SOLELY sexually based; beyond the character growth of Clare learning to like herself as she is and to realize her inner AND outer beauty, there is a female bully (& don't we ALL know some absolute BITCH who just LIVES to make others feel like crap??!!!??) who threatens public humiliation of Clare and Antonio, which would result in the loss of his contract.  Lots of angst... lots of sex... lots of self-realization that beauty isn't all about Barbie dimensions!\n\nGo read it.  It's awesome.

It will capture your heart.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\n* 5 + Stars *\n\n*2014 Favorite Read *\n\nSugar On The Edge is by far the best book Sawyer Bennett has written! She has proven her growth as an author, created more complex characters, gave them more of an edgy darkness, created a plot that was unique, and merged several genres together that work perfectly together.\n\nSugar On The Edge can be read as a stand alone novel or in the Last Call series order. The beloved characters from the previous books are present in Sugar On The Edge. They lend a strong supporting role for the characters without influencing the direction of this story or having their own stories repeated or referred to throughout the book. Sawyer Bennett allowed her leading characters, Gavin Cooke and Savannah Shepard, to take the readers away in a completely new direction.\n\nBritish author Gavin Cooke has come to the Outer Banks of North Carolina to complete his book. He is on a deadline. His destructive behaviors, drinking, and disregard have left his publishers and agent in a corner. They have suggested he take himself out of the seedy streets of London and buckle down. He is an arrogant self absorbed, dirty mouthed, critical, and contemptuous arse. He knows it and makes no apologies. His crude mouth, diabolical behavior, and self destruction have just changed geographical locations.\n\nGavin Cooke is sex on a stick! His filthy mouth and filthy moves will have you swooning. His vulnerability and misguided guilt will have you wanting to hug him after you tie his delicious self to the bed. He is one hot alpha male. His snarly, dry British sarcasm and creative blend of words will tantalize all the senses\n\nSavannah Shepard is a struggling photographer. After losing her job at the local newspaper she is forced to take on several jobs to make ends meet. When she takes on the job of being a temporary housekeeper for Gavin Cooke, her life has just taken on another crappy job. The man is a complete jerk. He assumes too much, sees too little, and berates everything. He may think shes a lamb and hes the big bad wolf . He has another thing coming, Savannah has taken on the wolves and beat them to the ground. She is a tigress in a lambs skin.\n\nGavin and Savannahs relationship is combustible and every surface they touch goes up in flames. Gavin may be domineering and Savannah may seem submissive but all is not what it seems. Together these two will find all the right ingredients to make the perfect combination that will intoxicate the readers.\n\nThere will be explosive sexual chemistry, panty dripping scenes, dramatic tear jerking moments, swooning romance, shocking actions, and a new story with a happy ending. Their journey will keep the readers captivated. I will say this, it is a good thing that Savannah and Gavin have their own persona Yoda, Brody Markham.\n\nSawyer Bennett has broke the mold with Sugar On The Edge. Her star is shining bright!\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nWhen I began reading End of Day by Jewel E. Ann, I had expectations that this was a paranormal type of book.  I was completely off base.  End of Day is a contemporary novel that may or may not be a dark thriller or it could be a dark romance.  Or it could be something else entirely.  It is in a class by itself, completely unique.\n\nAt first I had my doubts about this book.  It was a slow start but once the it got going I was completely entangled in it's web.  It all begins when Jude and Jessica Day are witnessing their own funerals.  Tragic circumstances in their lives have led them to fake their deaths,completely walk away from their old lives, and begin new ones.  It is apparent they are in a witness protection type of program.  These quirky, driven, successful twins become Jackson and Jillian Knight.  Their new personas are completely different from who they were in their old lives.  They chose to move to Nebraska.  They chose a quiet senior citizen  community to live in.  The only thing exciting that happens within Peaceful Woods is taking the trash out on the wrong day or cutting the grass one inch too short.\n\nTheir new nosy neighbors are intrigued, enchanted, charmed, and curious about their new neighbors.  They have charmed the community with the exception of their immediate neighbor, another younger resident in the community.\n\nSenior Master Sergeant AJ Manoghan has lived in this quiet, peaceful community for quite a few years.  He craves the nature of routine life and structured community.  His new neighbors are beyond belief.  They are brash, repulsive, noisy, immoral, and do not belong in Peaceful Woods.  Especially Jill, the blonde bombshell sexpot that exposes her assets at every opportunity.\n\nThe neighbor wars begin.  Jillian and AJ have declared war but beneath the surface they are insanely attracted to one another.  Now this should be the meaty part of the story, the sizzling hot love affair and the red hot chemistry between the two.  But no... this affair is only going to scratch the surface of this story.\n\nAJ appears to be an uptight man with a stick up his butt.  But appearances aren't all that they are cracked up to be. AJ has issues with PTSD.  He has a sketchy family background that indicates he may be a bit more unstable.\n\nJillian is an absolute contradiction.  She appears to be this wild, somewhat slutty woman that lives by her whims rather than plans and direction. Beneath the surface she is a caring and sensitive woman. She also has some serious mental issues that may or may not be dangerous.  She has a past that is questionable.  She is also mourning the loss of her former lover & psychiatrist Dr. Luke Jones.\n\nJackson knows all of Jillian's secrets.  On one hand he tries to direct her in a positive manner.  On the other hand he is allowing her to create a new life.  No matter what he will stand by his twin sisters side.\n\nBoth Jackson and Jillian have a ton of secrets.  There is the reason they are in Peaceful Woods.  What happened that made them walk away from their lives?  What kind of danger is lurking?  Jillian has some serious demons that stem from something that happened in her past.  Jackson also has some serious secrets lurking.  And finally AJ rounds the secret circle out, he has his own secrets lurking around the corner.\n\nMeanwhile they are living amongst the friendly senior citizens of Peaceful Woods.\n\nThis book ended on a major cliffhanger that has the reader screaming for more.\n\nJewel E. Ann is a brilliant writer and creates quirky characters living in a world only she could create.  She is a master of blending romance, suspense, and erotic moments that leave the reader breathless.  I loved how she played upon the characters identities with the Day and Knight and the Jack and Jill.  Very creative!  I can't wait to see what happens next in Middle of Knight.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nThe dynamic duo is back with another red hot romance and drop dead sexy hero that needs some loving.  Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward have created Mister Moneybags, a romance between a powerful CEO and a dynamic, beautiful reporter that's out for his blood.\n\nWhen Dex Truitt, the reclusive owner and CEO of Montague Enterprises, agrees to an exclusive interview with business reporter Bianca George, little did he know his title would change from Mister Moneybags , as Bianca dubbed him, to Mister Liar Liar Pants On Fire. What a man will do or become for a beautiful woman is crazy, fun, zany, and breathtaking.\n\nBianca George has her reasons for hating Dex Truitt and men like him with power.  She would never fraternize with the what she considers no good, worthless jerks.  When she meets a sexy bike messenger while trapped in the elevator at Mister Moneybags building, she's hit the jackpot.  A sexy, hard working, ordinary guy who's fun, intelligent, and full of personality.  He even whittles.  Dating a man like him is delightful.\n\nDex Truitt has gotten himself into a pickle.  When the sexy woman from the elevator all but castrated him, he couldn't actually tell her who he was.  He wanted to get to know this sexy woman beyond the elevator.  Maybe lying wasn't the best idea he ever had, but it was well worth it.\n\nNow Dex has buried himself in a mountain of lies that keep piling up.  He has to come clean to Bianca.  Will she accept his sincerity?\n\nDex's lies aren't the only lies that could destroy their relationship.  The lies from the past are bigger than anything Dex could conceive.  In fact, they could destroy all their lives.  Dex will do anything to keep the woman he loves.  But he will not lie to her again.\n\nVi Keeland and Penelope Ward once again brought a fun, sexy, snarky, and highly emotional romance to life.  I have to commend these authors for creating charismatic characters, delightful dialogue, and stunning descriptions in their characters world.  I am from West Palm Beach and they nailed the descriptions to perfection, from the Breakers Hotel ( where I attended my senior prom) to Good Samaritan Hospital ( where I had my children).  It was wonderful to revisit home through their book.\n\nLove these authors and love this book! I highly recommend Mister Moneybags!\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\n*** 2017 Favorite ***\n*** 6 Star Review ***\nThe one thing I have discovered is that when I open a Jewel E. Ann novel I am in for a great surprise and an all consuming reading experience. Her writing is charismatic, engaging, and real. She delivers a very entertaining story with a sense of humor while slamming the reader with a raw emotional experience. Not only does she create an entertaining romance, the one thing that stands out is the story itself is completely original. Of course we all know that there really aren't too many plots that are original, especially this day in age where the publishing world doesn't have specific guidelines and rules. What makes Jewel E. Ann stand out is her gift to tap into several plot ideas and combine them to make them completely her own and completely different from the other million books out there. She adds her magical touch of creating dynamic characters that are charmingly imperfect but very endearingly human.\n\nThe first thing I want to say about this book is no matter what your reading tastes are just KEEP READING! I know many of the romance genre readers have hard limits with books about cheating and will not read a book where the synopsis indicates this may happen. Again I say KEEP READING! This book is exactly what the title is. It's a messy, emotional, delightful story about When Life Happened.\n\nAs I began reading When Life Happened I immediately connected with Parker Cruse. Parker was betrayed by her twin sister Piper. Parker caught Piper cheating with her fianc&eacute;/ high school sweetheart Caleb. Weeks later her sister walked down the aisle Parker should of been walking. Parker made sure her walk of shame was done in style with a huge dose of laxatives resembling the scarlet letter on the train of her wedding gown. Revenge was sweet but it would never heal the wounds of a broken heart. Two years later and still emotionally paralyzed, Parker is moving on with her life. She's taking on the world of adulting. She's moving out of her parents house, she's going to get a real job, and she's going to be an independent grown up. It doesn't matter that she's moving across the street into her grandparents old farmhouse. It's far enough away from her parents. It's also far enough away from conniving twin sister and despicable husband that are returning to town in a month. What she didn't anticipate is a grubby sheepdog and sexy neighbor intruding in her space. She didn't count on the sexy neighbor, Gus Westman, making her feel things she hadn't felt in years. She didn't count on her neighbor making her feel like a woman. She also didn't count on him being married. She can overlook his ordinary wardrobe and baseball caps, she can deal with his adorable mangy dog and give it a haircut, she can hold herself back from swooning at his bad jokes and quirky grins. Being around him on a hourly basis isn't all it's cracked up to be. What she cannot overlook is his wife. The wife who becomes her boss and meal ticket. It doesn't matter if she's the world's worst human being and wife. Gus belongs to that despicable woman, her boss. Gus wants to save his marriage until he doesn't. Parker despises cheaters. She has taken back control of her life and learned to love herself. Who does Gus Westman think he is to take that away from her? He's the man who loves her exactly for who she is until When Life Happened.\n\nSounds like a love story gone wrong? That's absolutely correct but ... KEEP READING... life happens and Parker is in the middle of all it's beautiful mess. She's going to find that life isn't black and white. There are two sides to every story and her story is just beginning. She's going to learn about forgiveness, acceptance, and love.\n\nJewel E. Ann had me with the first page. I could not put this book down and was completely surprised by the outcome because yes I am one of those readers that absolutely hates cheating. I am hopeless romantic that believes in true love and happily ever afters. I am also a human being that understands life can spin out of control and sometimes bad things happen before the good things can be appreciated. Life is messy but it is also beautiful. Parker experienced it all. Jewel E. Ann created a beautiful reading experience that left me with the warm and fuzzies!\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Twisted Twosome is another winner that had me laughing out loud and craving snack cakes.\n\nA contractor and an heiress.  A man desperate for money and a woman desperate for her independence.  A man with honor and solid work ethics.  A woman with a dream that has champagne taste and a beer budget.  What they have in common is they are both strong willed, smart mouthed, and dedicated to what they believe in.  They say opposites attract and in this case it couldn't be more true.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this novel and connected with both of the characters.  Their snarky banter, ridiculous pranks were just part of the pretty package.  Their true hearts and integrity won me over.  Their love for one another had me sighing and swooning.  This book is loosely connected to My Best Friends Ex.  Several of the characters appear in both books.  I cant wait to see what comes next for this hilarious group of friends.

I have not read the previous two books, but I will be sure to rectify that. But if you are like me and have not read the previous books, I think the author has done a great job in making this book read as a standalone.\nNormally I prefer my romance books to be on the raunchier side, and this book is definitely not that. Though when I did finish this story, I don't necessarily think I missed that part all that much.\nThis is a very well written small town romance about second chances. Not second chances at love, but second chances at life. Cole most certainly deserves his. But as with all small towns, gossip that bares no element of truth has a way of crippling a person.\nMaddie took me some time to connect with. She is at first, a very insecure woman. After making a deal with Cole, they start to connect and she slowly sheds her insecurities.\nWhat makes this book a great read for me is the cast of minor characters. They all add to the story in their own way and quite often had me laughing with their shenanigans. This is the reason I will go back and read the previous books.\nA highly enjoyable story that I thoroughly recommend.\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\nThis is a great follow up to JL Davis' debut novel Last.

This game has a lot of scary rides like that rollar coster or being shot out of shotting barrels while it's a snow storm. And the giant bee's you have to dodge them or hit thim with a barrel.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nHere's where you kind of need to take a very large leap of faith. Apparently a secret corner of the government knows EVERYTHING and anticipates that a GIANT monster will...invade looking for its masters. Plus, if there was a giant monster sitting in your backyard of your neighborhood, heck, your country, I don't think you accept it on terms of \"peaceful relations\" with some island nobody's ever heard of.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nI love this game when it was on regular Nintendo and now on Nintendo 64. I love riding in peoples yard throwing papers at the windows and breaking them of course your not suppost to do that or you'll lose points to get some points throw the papers in their mail boxes or at the front door step. A dog will chase you and a old woman to stop them just throw paper at them you also have to watch out for cars and motorcycles.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nThis dvd comes with a musical cd which is great now about this dvd. The U.S. people went to Japan to have them draw the cartoons of nine short movies that involes the Martix movies each with different stories. The americans wrote the stories. To tell what I think about each story look down below.\n\nFINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS (8/10)-This one is the only one in 3D graphics I say it looks pretty good, I love it when while they were inside the ship shooting at the machines that were outside just like in the \"Matrix Revolutions\", the dissapointing thing was at the end they all died anyway.\n\nSECOND RENAISSANCE PART 1 & 2 (10/10)-This one is the best of all of them. I wish it was a movie of it's own making it to the big screen. The drawings were 100% perfect especially on how the United Nation building was drawn. Both 1 & 2 is telling you on how it all started when man invented machines to do work for them then on machine was the first to kill his master then all the humans were distorying the machines then the machine created a city for themselves to get back at humanity.\n\nKID'S STORY (7/10)-The animation was very good at first until the agents arived at this boys high school and started chasing him at his school he was running on his skate board thats when the picture started to look so blury and way out of drawn right which ruined it for me. This boy was a lost soul to commit suicide.\n\nPROGRAM (5/10)-For me it was \"ok\". I liked the fighting in the forest when that man and woman were knights to me those were good moves, the animation was a bit bad it looked like that anime show \"Regin\". The story was a bit entertaining when this man wanted this woman to come with him to leave the matrix she refuses then kills him, then she wakes up learns that it was all a test and she pass but she didn't took it too well.\n\nWORLD RECORD (4/10)-World Record was the worstest onw I hated out of the most. All it had was a man who was not suppose to race on his legs or else he could gets paralise for good he didn't listen when his legs started to break the whole picture started to look so stupid and weird it usually had nothing to do with the matrix movies. I always fast foward through this one movie what a waste. Also very bad animation.\n\nBEYOND (5.5/10)-It was just 50/50 for me. I could have been better. Just some girl who loses her cat she goes off to fine it in the ally with a bunch of kids playing and for some reason either they have magic powers or were they was at gravity is not a law I didn't get.\n\nA DETECTIVE STORY (6/10)-I feel the same way about this one. Some detective is going after a computer hacker. It starts to get interesting when he meets Trinity on the train then the agents started shooting at her and him was my favorite part. Trinity her animated version looked very good in this movie.\n\nMATRICULATED (6/10)-Don't know much to say about the last movie except it was alright. They were turing machines programing them to be on their side for a change. In the end all of the people died from fighting the evil machines, the only left alive was one machine which looked heart broken seeing that woman died.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It is the perfect size if you are looking to just carry your iPad around with a few accessories (cellphone, keys, charger, plane tickets). The bag is very well made and the padding is super thick. I know if I dropped my iPad it would be perfectly fine in this bag. Some reviewers complained that there was a fish smell coming from their bags and mine had no such problem. Also, some people complain that it is too small. Well that is what this bag is made for. It is made to hold you iPad securely and that is about it. If you need to hold a lot of gadgets and paper work I suggest you look elsewhere. The color is an olive drab and looks very nice. You don't have to worry about this bag being confused for a purse. The hardware is made out of tough ABS plastic and should hold up for the life of the product. The interior is roomy enough to hold my iPad 3 in a Timbuk2 case that Amazon sells without any problems. I tried to think of some cons for this bag but I can't come up with any. It is exactly what I was looking for and the craftsmanship is top notch. I would highly recommend this bag if you a looking for a small carrying case rather then a more traditional laptop/briefcase.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nI ordered several different Spigen cases while waiting for Apple to deliver my iPhone 7 Plus. While all of them were high quality this is the only one I had problems with. The cases tolerances are so precise that I was unable to get one corner on without causing the plastic to slightly hold under. Besides this slight flaw it is a nice minimalistic case. I ended up using the Spigen Neo Hybrid as my daily case because it has a small profile, good looks, and offers plenty of protection. I gave the case three stars because of the corner damage caused when installing per factory directions.\nScore:\n3\n\nReview:\nI'm not sure why Amazon doesn't have me as a verified purchaser (bought them from Amazon), but here's my two cents. I hadn't played golf for about 8 years and my TaylorMade Burners from 2000 were looking a little shabby. Wanting to stick with TaylorMade I went with the Aeroburners because they are designed to be forgiving on off-center shots. I am pleased to say these clubs do not fail in anyway. Right out of the box they were perfect. I didn't need to get them shortened/lengthened or the lie angle adjusted. After a quick brush up lesson and some range work I am hitting more consistent than ever. Even with the long irons. I picked up the Aeroburner 4 & 5 rescue, 5 & 7 Woods and Mini Driver to compliment the set. These additional clubs are just as good and with the Mini Driver (designed as a 3 wood replacement) no more slicing. I have since taken out the 4 & 5 irons because for me they were redundant and the hybrids are more forgiving. One thing of note is that TaylorMade says you will hit longer with these but that is because the lofts. I would recommend hitting some real balls to adjust your distance since range balls are designed to be durable and not for distance. In short I highly recommend the Aeroburners. If you have a chance to demo them you'll be pleasantly surprised.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Unfortunately, when replacing this, it broke the cable that ran the wireless, so I had no wifi.  Taking it into the apple store set me back $500 for a new display, since that small cable was integrated into the entire display.

This isn't to say that its flawless, but that its well worth the money (especially if you paid $4.99 like I did).\n\nThe Bad:\n1. There's not a lot of bad here at all.  The controls are a little clunky and wierd and despite the fact that I'm running a quad core i7, I still get a few hiccups on it though not many and they mostly went away when I turned the settings down a bit.\n\n2. They give your character special outfits and theres hidden cars and such, but overall there wasn't a lot you could do to customize things for yourself.\n\n3. The game is pretty linear.  Its not really like GTA in which you can run all over the city doing all kinds of things.  I mean you can drive all over the city but they discourage reckless damage so thats not as much fun and its not as satisfying as in GTA 4 anyway, especially since the pedestrians keep jumping out of the way and they don't allow you to shoot randomly.  With each section they open up a certain number of street crime side missions that happen in order and other things, which is fun and nice but you're basically playing the main story in order, and picking up the side missions in order as you go more or less.  I guess you can hold off on the side missions till later if you want, point is they unlock based on your progression on the main story so theres not much to do other than that and the main story.\n\n4. Its a pretty big world, comparable to GTA 4 maybe, but to be honest its kinda boring for that size.  You're discouraged from running into things, there's not a lot of interactivity with the broader environment and other than street crimes of which there are 40 and case locations, theres really no other places to go or things to do of value.  So you have this pretty nice sized world with pretty good detail but not much to do in it.  I'm not sure what you could have done that would have still been consistent with the theme, but its just an observation.  I did like the detail and landmarks, though having lived in LA, I know there were a number of well known places that were there in the 40's as well that weren't represented.\n\nThe Mediocre:\n1. This game came out in 2011, thats over 2 years after GTA 4 (and Saints Row 2) and yet the driving feels substandard.  Granted this is not a driving game, the driving and open world is nice but its not like GTA 4 in which driving is a major component of the game.  Still, since Rockstar Games (which made GTA 4) is involved in this one, you'd think they would have been better able to pull the driving and physics, vehicle damage and world damage into this.  Sure, there's some damage and some things can be destroyed, but it seems more in line with the kind of damage you would have seen in GTA San Andreas (from 2005), rather than a game from 2011.\n\n2. The aim on the guns is a little wierd.  It works very similar to GTA 4 in terms of how you aim but its a little different and to be honest, not as smooth.  As such, it always takes a couple extra seconds to get the dot thingie to line up on the guy you're shooting at and by then he's already put a few bullets in you (luckily you seem to recover pretty quick and can take an amazing amount of bullets before you start to feel faint).  This factor by the way maybe is not so lucky as both aspects (the aim and the huge health) detract from the realism.  That having beeen said, I don't even think the shooting is a focus of this game.  There's a few shootouts here and there but again, I think the questioning and interrogation are really where this game shines.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. The game installed with no problems and I had no issues whatsoever running it on Windows 7.  It sounded like a lot of people had trouble but I didn't have any at all.  Maybe by the time I installed (July, 2012) they had resolved whatever the issue was.  I think the rating of this game is thrown off because a lot of people gave it a low rating due to installation issues as opposed to the actual gameplay.  I think if they had gotten to play the game (very frustrating if they couldnt) they likely would have rated the game much higher and I think the overall rating of this game would be higher.  If you look at the non download versions on Amazon at the ratings, you see that its a lot more balanced.\n\n2. The voice acting is superb.  Really well done.  So is the scripting.  Pay attention to a lot of the crowd chatter, some of it is very clever.  My favorite crowd line so far is \"I got married by a judge...I should have asked for a jury\".\n\n3. I have never seen facial expressions that are so realistic and detailed in a video game like this.  It is very well done and I think this is going to set a standard for future video games of this type.\n\n4. I really loved the way they did questioning and interrogation.  There's no meters or bars to tell you if someone is lying or telling the truth, you have to figure it out just like if you were a real cop.  You have to watch them, look at their faces, their movements, pay attention to how they speak.  It's not so much what they say but how they say it that makes such a big difference.  This kind of interaction that doesn't involve a game telling you what to do or what someone is doing but forcing you to figure it out for yourself by paying attention is incredible, realistic and for sure one of the results of the incredibly detailed facial work that goes with the game.  I hope that future games are able to integrate this sort of idea in to their games as well that you can figure things out if you're given enough detail.\n\n5. The game is very immersive.  I lived in Los Angeles for a while and I can't tell where I am.  I recognize most of the streets but granted, I never spent much time downtown and certainly not in the late 40's.  Everything looks really nice though.\n\n6. The characters are extremely well developed, particularly the protagonist.  I think he's sort of likable and all, maybe a little too serious and too strained for my taste.  I prefer it when characters have a little humor about them but thats just my personal taste.  Clearly this guy has no sense of humor at all but maybe thats just how he is.\n\n7. The game is almost like being inserted into the movie L.A. Confidential.  There's a lot of references to the movie in game as well, both direct and indirect, so the game producers certainly knew what part of their inspiration was.\n\n8. It doesn't shy away from more adult themes.  This is an adult game, so seeing the naked body of a woman who has been beaten to death or talking with a teenager who has been raped and drugged would make sense for a police detective.  Although these images and situations may seem disturbing to some, I think if you're going to immerse yourself into this role, then you need to be willing to accept that the police have to deal with such things sometimes.\n\nOverall definately worth the time and money.  A really fun experience that has a few flaws for sure, but the flaws aren't big enough to detract significantly from the experience.  If you're considering this game, definately get it, especially if its under $10-$15.\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\nThis is an amazing game that I highly recommend.

There's no meters or bars to tell you if someone is lying or telling the truth, you have to figure it out just like if you were a real cop. You have to watch them, look at their faces, their movements, pay attention to how they speak. It's not so much what they say but how they say it that makes such a big difference. This kind of interaction that doesn't involve a game telling you what to do or what someone is doing but forcing you to figure it out for yourself by paying attention is incredible, realistic and for sure one of the results of the incredibly detailed facial work that goes with the game. I hope that future games are able to integrate this sort of idea in to their games as well that you can figure things out if you're given enough detail.\n\n5. The game is very immersive. I lived in Los Angeles for a while and I can't tell where I am. I recognize most of the streets but granted, I never spent much time downtown and certainly not in the late 40's. Everything looks really nice though.\n\n6. The characters are extremely well developed, particularly the protagonist. I think he's sort of likable and all, maybe a little too serious and too strained for my taste. I prefer it when characters have a little humor about them but thats just my personal taste. Clearly this guy has no sense of humor at all but maybe thats just how he is.\n\n7. The game is almost like being inserted into the movie L.A. Confidential. There's a lot of references to the movie in game as well, both direct and indirect, so the game producers certainly knew what part of their inspiration was.\n\n8. It doesn't shy away from more adult themes. This is an adult game, so seeing the naked body of a woman who has been beaten to death or talking with a teenager who has been raped and drugged would make sense for a police detective. Although these images and situations may seem disturbing to some, I think if you're going to immerse yourself into this role, then you need to be willing to accept that the police have to deal with such things sometimes.\n\nOverall definately worth the time and money. A really fun experience that has a few flaws for sure, but the flaws aren't big enough to detract significantly from the experience. If you're considering this game, definately get it, especially if its under $10-$15.\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\nI just started playing this game but so far I really love it!  I had reservations because it is an older game (2006) and I figured going in that the graphics weren't going to be what we're used to here in 2012.  Certainly this is true but the graphics are still really good, I think this game was probably ahead of its time in that area.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to go ahead and play it is that I had never played a Hitman game before but when I saw the trailers for the new Hitman 4 coming out, I got really interested.  I didn't want to make the same mistake I made with GTA though which was I played GTA 4 as my first GTA experience and I LOVED it, it was amazing.  Then I went back and tried to play GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas and I couldn't do it because I had gotten so used to the way GTA 4 worked that going back to a game that was older and didn't look or feel as good simply didn't work for me.  So my plan with Hitman was to play the older one first and that way the new one would feel even better!\n\nSo about the game.  I've played a few missions so far and what I love the most about it is the fact that its kind of open ended.  You get a mission and there's a huge ton of different ways you can complete it.  You can walk around for a while, be patient, take your time. You can make things look like an accident, you can go in guns blazing if you want, you can sneak up on people if you prefer.  You can kill only your targets or you can feel fine with some collateral damage and wipe out a few bystanders.\n\nObviously some choices will give you more credit and lower notoriety than others, but the fact that you have this amazing freedom to figure things out for yourself and that there's really not a \"right\" way or a \"wrong\" way to complete the missions.  As I say, some ways may be more optimal than others, but you can tackle them in the way that fits your style of gameplay best...or even better, you can play missions over and over and try different tactics to see what works and what doesn't.\n\nI'm taking my time with each mission, really thinking about the tactics and discovering the areas so that I can formulate good plans.  This way I feel like I'm really a hitman who considers everything rather than just a guy running in and shooting everything, which obviously could work as well.  This being the case, I see many many hours and hours of potential gameplay in this thing.\n\nI bought this as a download on sale at another website for $2.46.  It works perfectly and is an amazing steal at that price, though frankly I was prepared to spend up to the $10 or so that Amazon had it for as well because I felt it would be worth it, and it definately totally is.  Especially with the new Hitman coming out, if you haven't played the series and are curious about it, try this one and I think you'll be hooked and ready for the next one.  I only wish that in future versions, they allow you to customize your character instead of having to be the bald guy.\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\nI wasn't sure if I'd like this game or not but thought I'd take a chance.  When I first started playing, I became more skeptical and I didn't really enjoy it a lot, but I kept with it and soon it grew on me and started to become more fun.\n\nThe graphics are very nice, buildings and streets are as good as I've seen and comparable to GTA 4 which came out in 2008.  NYC is very nicely represented and you can recognize many of the buildings and settings.  The people and car quality for graphics wasn't quite as good, I would say more on the level of GTA San Andreas which I think came out in 2005, so a bit of an older look for those aspects.\n\nRunning around on free mode is fun for a while, jumping over buildings, consuming people and taking on their bodies, etc.  After a while it does get a bit old so its time to move on to the main mission and the many many side missions.  You complete the side missions to get exp points that you use to upgrade your skills.\n\nI liked the progression of the disease from seeing a normal peaceful city in the beginning to a city filled with disease and panic near the end.  Billboards are normal at first, but by the end are all about the disease, its a nice touch.  I liked the way the story was presented too.  It starts at the end so like any good movie, you jump in on big action, then you go back to day 1 and build up from there.  The way the story is presented is intriquing.  The main character has lost his memory and as he learns what happened, so do you!  I had kind of figured out where it was going early on but I do that with movies too and it didn't ruin it for me.\n\nThat's the good.  Now a couple of minor issues.\n1. The controls for PC are just way way way too complicated.  There's tons and tons of different moves, combos, devastators, etc and there's all kinds of combo keys to hit to make them work.  I couldn't remember them all.  It's like if you double tap a directional key and hit the left mouse button and then E this happens but if you hit the right mouse button and F something else happens.  When you're in the middle of a battle, its seriously hard to remember all that.  This having been said, I was still able to complete the main mission on normal mode and most of the side missions even with my more limited arsenal that resulted from not remembering what buttons to hit for what move.  Seriously though, this was just way too many options to keep them all straight and sometimes I just hit everything and hope for the best.\n\n2. This is a personal issue but I prefer games that let you customize your character.  I realize GTA doesn't do that and I still enjoyed those games as I did Prototype, but I really was able to identify more with my character in Saints Row 2 for example, because I created her look and stuff.  I have trouble to identify playing as a male character.  I can do it but its more fun for me to be a tough butt kicking girl!\n\n3. Despite the open world of Prototype, I still felt it could be kind of linear in a way and when it came to the side missions, they tended to be rather repetative.  Sure, there were a few different kinds of side missions.  Glide toward a target, fight as infected, fight as ally, consume events, etc, but within each type the variation was minimal so you were kind of doing the same things many times over.  I also thought I'd see the kind of free for all battle royale that was hinted at in the beginning of the game, near the end but that never really materialized.\n\n4. There's a little bit of music in the menus but otherwise there really isn't any.  The sound effects are terrific, I love them but some music would have been nice too.  Music did a lot to help define games like GTA, Saints Row and Dragon Age for me.\n\nAnyway, I was pleasantly surprised ultimately and it did turn out to be an enjoyable game.  If you like GTA or Saints Row type games, you may enjoy this one too.\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\nI wasn't sure if I'd like this game or not but thought I'd take a chance.

Only output the score and nothing else.\nReview:\nWhile I confess I liked GTA 4 a little better than the ELC add on games (better story and more engaging, longer play, more missions, etc), I still loved ELC.  It was 2 pretty full games in one with a good number of missions and it was neat to see how some of the missions overlap with GTA 4 and the two ELC games overlap with each other.\n\nPersonally I like to play games with customizable characters rather than a predetermined one.  I prefer to play as a girl when I can because playing as a guy is a bit strange but I can overlook it in this case.  As with GTA 4, the world is beautiful and realistic, the cars take damage and are neat, its fun to run over things or shoot at things or whatever.  I didn't feel the same emotional connection at the end as I did with GTA 4, but that's okey.  It was a fun couple of games and if you liked GTA 4 (or any of the other GTA games), then I highly recommend it.  Also, you don't need to have GTA 4 to play these.  Its not an expansion, ELC can stand alone on its own.\nScore:", "output": " 4", "formatted_output": "4", "model_inf_time": 9.93}]
