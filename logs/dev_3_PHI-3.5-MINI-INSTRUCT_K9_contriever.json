Cheap cloth on the front.  Hardly any padding.  Hanging brackets only hold if you never touch the board again--slightest movement makes it fall off the wall.  Bad smell.  I can't believe they had the nerve to charge almost $33 for this--or that I actually paid it!\nScore:\n1\n\nReview:\nThis is a beautifully made phone--quite heavy, not flimsy like most other \"traditional\" phones these days.  However, I only gave it 3 stars because even at its highest setting, the volume is much lower than my old, flimsy phone that was half the price.  But I'll keep this as it's simply a secondary phone that I use with MagicJack, mostly to call myself when Ii can't find my cell phone!  Maybe it's just this one phone, too, that has such low volume--but I don't care enough to send it back and get another one.  It's good enough.\nScore:\n3\n\nReview:\nWorks just as it's supposed to!

Since this was under $10 I guess I should have expected it, but I had a similar one that worked for more than 8 years before going bad and didn't cost much more than this.  i guess I'll try another brand this time.\nScore:\n2\n\nReview:\nThis is definitely a quality machine.  Whether it's worth the trouble of assembling, disassembling and cleaning the removable parts is a question of how much time you have, what you're using it for, etc.  I use it sometimes for my hard kitchen and bathroom floors but it doesn't replace an old-fashioned mop for getting into corners, along baseboards, etc.  However, I do use it regularly to \"spot-clean\" my very light carpeting and throw rugs.  Much easier than getting down on hands and knees to use a spray spot-cleaner, so I do it more often--my carpets look much nicer.  It actually pulls more cat hair and other debris out of my carpet than my regular upright vacuum does--but it means you have wet debris in the rollers and bin, which is a bit messy to clean out.\n\nOverall, this is a somewhat pricey investment considering it does not, for me, completely replace my regular mop or vacuum.  But I do use it often enough, and it seems sturdy enough, that I'm sure the cost will be worth it in the long run.  And my rugs do look very nice!\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\nNicely made, quite sturdy when open.

Thankfully she felt sorry enough for me that she finally gave in, and Monday night I was sucked into the tumultuous romance of Lynch and Kat!  Ive been fortunate over the past year to have quite a few times to chat with Tory and she is just the sweetest thing ever confident, yet simultaneously questioning her writing and you expect these wonderfully sweet romances  right up to the point where you realize that Torys inner voice has a MOUTH on her!  LOL!  Anyway, if you want to check out more of her works, look below for the carousel that showcases a partial backlist  Tory writes contemporary, she has some paranormal/shifters, some heroes (SEALS, etc) and also a trio of brothers (Evans Security  what Im rereading now because I need some more of a Tory fix ).  Another way to check out some of her books?  Go to her webpage and in the top right hand side, input your email and sign up for her newsletter!\n\nOkay, on to the Wild Marauders.  During a shootout once of the bikers is wounded, so Prospect Chicken is sent to the towns clinic to get a doctor.  Instead, he gets a nurses aid / receptionist  Kat.  This is not the first time that Kat & Lynch have met, but it is the most combustible!  Lynch isn't an MC President with a warm and fuzzy side in private; hes hard, raunchy and unapologetic and while he likes Kats willingness to stand up to him, and won't tolerate it if it disrupts the club or her safety.  With the Red Devils upping their game to take over the Wild Marauder and Dark Menace MC territories, Kat becomes an unwilling pawn in the power struggle, and she and Lynch have to decide if their relationship is worth the risk.\n\nIve read many of Tory Richards stories before and they are definitely panty changers.  Not only can you get a good cardio workout from reading her books, but they (gasp!) also have a STORY to them!  (Double gasp!)  This is NOT a gratuitous sex scene to sex scene book, but delves into the lifestyle of an MC and has some suspense/mystery/danger in it to boot.  One thing I usually dislike about first books in a series is that the author is trying so hard to set up subsequent stories, and push character introductions, that the story is actually left dangling.  This is NOT the case in this Wild Marauders book; while you are introduced to the MC and some of its members, you don't get dragged under with multiple back-stories, and the introduction to the next book in this MC series is so subtle that it actually surprised me a bit when I saw in her newsletter that the next book would be about a friendly MCs President, Stone of the Dark Menace (you meet him in this book because his MC comes in to help a few times & vice versa).  While Wild Marauders is a standalone romance, the threat of the Red Devils MC remains and will make a nice arc suspense theme as the background for Stone & Rachels romance.\n\nThere are several litmus tests that I usually have with a first book that I read.  Do I have the urge to look & see what other books the authors had published so that I can read them?  (Since I already have many of them, I guess since Im rereading the brothers thats a PASS.)  Another is if I find myself hoping the next book in the series will release SOON, which leads me to a question for Tory   when will DARK MENACE  STONE be done so I can get a copy?  [wink]\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nDISCLAIMER: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an HONEST review. However, please note that since I realized it was third of a series, I did purchase the first two books to read so that I was familiar with the characters.\n\nFirst of all, don't be afraid to pick this book up -- you don't necessarily need to have read the prior two books in the \"Foul Ball\" series in order to understand &/or enjoy the book. It can easily be a standalone read. Secondly, don't be put off thinking you need to like/understand baseball in order to read this book. Baseball is more a \"setting\" for the book - and just as easily gambling could be used as the setting.\n\nCatriona McDaniel is back and working for the Soldiers, once again a team reporter and living with her fiance, Benji. You're introduced to her half-brother, Quinn, who is a shady McDaniel that creates a huge problem for Cat. This book exhibits similiar themes to the prior two -- greed is bad and the rich are overpriveleged. There are rants against ball player salaries; overconsumption by \"celebrities\" and Benji gets in a few more ecological points. But the basic of the book is a \"cozy mystery\" of what actually happened on Cat's balcony and how that ripples out into the rest of her life and the baseball playoffs. It's an enjoyable read, with a few cute little twists. I would have enjoyed the story much more if I hadn't thought too much about it (guess that's a downside to knowing you're going to review it -- instead of reading for enjoyment, you're reading it knowing you need to review it). I think the whole relationship with Benji REALLY bothers me. Between her \"dalliance\" in \"Curveball\" with Junior and her nightmares about getting married (& more than obvious reluctance to do so) I just couldn't believe the relationship. And what woman really thinks about if her ring is actually real 14K gold (& how in the world does a college professor afford a 2 carat diamond???)? The ending bothered me; she obviously did NOT want to go with him for a year and to end it with her looking longingly at Soldier Field... well, not sure if that is meant to let the reader guess that the engagement is doomed to fail, or if it was more of a \"I promise I'll be back\" situation.\n\nI did really like the family themes; family sticks together, etc... It was also great that Quinn returned in the end to save her. I thought that I had read this was a three book series, but I think it'd really be interesting to \"hear\" from Michael McDaniel (the father) if there is a future book...\n\nOverall, about a 3.8 star book (I rounded up) but it's a nice, easy read with some fun characters. Enjoy!\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\n4.5 stars!!\n\nIT'S A TRAP!\n\nDammit. Y'all know that serials PISS. ME. OFF. Guess what? \"WOLF BAIT is the first book in the Wolf Cove series\" does not, to me, translate to -- \"WOLF BAIT ends in a cliff hanger - so sorry\". I expected that it meant the author planned to then feature other staff from Wolf Cove. Plus, with the title, I thought there might have even been a surprise of a shifter going on and it just wasn't referenced in the blurb (by the way - NO, there is NOT). Imagine my pissed-offed-ness when I reached the end... &*@#$(!!!!!  By the way, don't be put off by the \"lot of sex\".  The main characters don't really have sex until about 90% of the way into the story, but before that there is an (overseen) lesbian scene and masturbation scene... so don't turn the book away thinking it is going to be filled edge to edge with smut.  It's not.\n\nWhat IS it filled with?  Not an ending.  Not even a HFN.  (Sorry - I hold a grudge.  Just think about how many times I've said that I'm still angry with Bella Jewel for beating me to a teary pulp at the end of SHADE.  See.  GRUDGE-HOLDER.)  This is the story of a church sheltered college junior who expects to graduate from her Christian college in a year, marry her childhood / neighbor sweetheart fiance who is the pastor's son, and give him her virginity on their wedding night.  Not that they haven't been tempted by some heavy make-out sessions, but Jed always held back.  Well, except for that time Abbi finds him balls deep in another girl...  So Abbi goes to the job fair & interviews for a summer hotel position at the newly opening \"Wolf's Cove Lodge\" in Alaska, and gets the call that she's gotten on staff.\n\nHer first night there she has her first drink, gets drunk, and runs into Mr. Wolf... and a fascination is born.  If you want to try to pigeonhole it, the Virgin / Billionaire trope probably works best.  There's a lot of subplot going on -- Henry Wolf is controlled by his father dangling control of the Wolf lodge chain in front of him, just as Abbi is controlled by her Mama's approval & fear of the Church teachings. (I'm assuming the second novel will take into account the amount of self-subjugation these characters are willing to endure for their goals!) It's also a novel of awakenings -- Abbi to owning her sexuality and independence, and Henry to balancing the lessons of his grandparents against the goals of his father.  There's also a little subtext in there about self-worth, and not accepting cheating from your significant other just to appease public opinion / community expectations.\n\nOriginally posted on SnarkyMomReads\nSnarky Mom's Scale of Awesomeness!

Its amazing what weird crap runs through your head while you're hopped up on Nyquil.\n\nAnyway, as usual, Entangled Publishing has a wonderful release here & I absolutely loved it!\n\nWhen flaky Las Vegas hairdresser Molly McLaren overhears a Russian hit man planning to kill a US congressman and take out Hoover Dam in the process, she becomes a target for murder. Now, on the run from the assassin and a dirty cop, she winds up in an eighteen wheeler with an ex-cop sporting a bum leg, a bad attitude, and a body built for loving.\n\nGrey Wilson just wanted to be left alone. No more Las Vegas. No more casinos. And no more floozy women like the one his best friend sent him to pick up on the side of the road. She talks fast, but her endless curves and sensuous nature make him want to slow down. Which is not in the cards. Grey knows he needs to unload his excess baggage. And quick. But when someone tries to kill the Vegas beauty, Molly captures his heart with her backbone of steel, and brains to boot. Now in order to grasp the future that had once seemed impossible, Molly and Grey need to keep Hoover Dam, the congressman, and their love from being blown sky-high.\n\nGrey and Molly realize that neither are what the other appears on the surface, and their love story develops as they run from the Russian mafia, dirty cops and suspicious task force members.  This was a great before bed read!\n\nNow, as for the weird sh! t that runs through my headand its not just THIS story, but romance stories overall.  Have you ever noticed how they ALWAYS seem to have condoms at the ready?  So here I am, all hopped up on Nyquil and all I can start thinking of are those coupon dispensers in grocery stores and how the men in romance novels seem to have the same thing going with their wallets.  I mean, take Grey.  I guess I can understand a guy always having a condom in his wallet.  What really cracks me up, however, is how its always mentioned that they grab for their pants & then you hear the crinkle of foil.  Really?  You just have a condom hanging loose in your pants pocket?  How long has it been in there and how many wash/dry cycles has it been through?  Do you REALLY want to USE that one??  On top of that, when you're on the run from the Russian mafia and people are shooting at you, WHEN are you taking the time to refill your condom stash?!!??  Me?  Id be more worried about staying alive than making a stop at the corner drugstore to pop in for condoms but thats just me.  Must be different for boys.  ??\n\nI know.

Um, it's not really that, but at the same time, it is sooo much more!  First of all, be aware:  THIS HAS BDSM THEMES OUT THE WAZOO.  (And there is wazoo play, too.)  While Snarky Vanilla Mom isn't averse to reading BDSM themes, what almost did make me put down the Kindle was when the main male character proclaimed himself a sadist.  Yeah, that was going a bit too far for me out of my comfort zone.  However, I stuck with it, and I am glad I did!\n\nMischa leaves San Francisco to head to Seattle to help her friend, Dylan, plan her wedding, and also to meet up with a former colleague to partner up for a new tattoo shop.  (Apparently there are two prior stories to this one so Dylan's story was one of the prior ones - which if I'd known that, I'd have known more of what I was getting into reading.)  She meets Connor, an Irishman, and the attraction is instantaneous.  While Mischa is not unfamiliar with BDSM play, she's not as \"into it\" as Connor - so she has a bit of a learning curve to loosen up her control issues for the trust exchange inherent in BDSM.  While the sex scenes ARE smokin' hot, and Connor professes several times that he is a sadist, the \"scenes\" are pretty laidback compared to what they could have depicted (there was talk of hot wax, whips, etc... - but none of that happened in the book).  The story was more about the fact that from the age of six, Mischa had to be the parent in the family, and therefore has massive issues about giving up control and trust.  On the flip side, Connor suffers from fear he'll turn out like his abusive father, so he has massive issues about giving up control, trust and his ability to even love.\n\nTemptation's Edge is their story.  It's DEFINITELY one of those books you wouldn't want left up on your Kindle where the kids could read parts of it - 'cause quite frankly, I always thought that pinching was solely used for getting your kids' attention while out in public since you can't really whack `em upside the backs of their heads then -- so they'd just have even more things to snicker about if they read parts of it.  Don't let the heavy sex turn you away, either - it's actually tastefully done, again - SMOKIN' HOT, but it's not just a sex scene after scene book - there is actually a PLOT (gasp!).  You'll find your heart breaking right along with Mischa's and cheer on Connor when he steps off the cliff.  Read \"Temptation's Edge\" to find out if they ever figure it out...\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nMARINE FOR HIRE has an on-leave Marine doing manny duty for a friends sister, Sheridan, who is the divorced, single mom of 7 month twin boys.  Sam is supposed to keep his hands off and his eyes open, because Sheridans ex-husband is bothering her and wants her to take him back even though she caught him in their bed with another woman.  Problem?  She doesnt like lying, and Sam has to pretend that he isn't military because of her ex turning her off of military types.  Ive always enjoyed the books from Tawna Fenske Ive read before and this one was no different.  It was smexy, smart and best of all?  Had such hilarious parenting moments that I was absolutely cracking up!  I really related to this book because yeah, I have vague memories of those horrible early months with twin boys and dealing with not feeling I was doing the right thing like normal Moms would (big theme in the book of validating Sheridan)  and how the big tough Marine handles situations (diaper poop blow-out in public with no diaper bag) is hilarious:\nI even bought some little bags of birdseed so we could feed them.  The birds, not teh babies.  The twins didn't eat birdseed.  Much, he amended silently, thinking it best not to mention his ill-advised attempt to let the boys feed the birds.  It had resulted in a quick call to Poison Control to make sure it was okay for babies to ingest small amounts of millet.\nTheres also frank talk about sexuality and motherhood in the book (who hasn't been interrupted by a crying kid?  Try having TWINS!) and this part had me roaring!  He grinned, and she felt bad for antagonizing him.  Hell, hed just cooked her dinner.

I just wanted to clarify so you didn't have expectations (either good or bad) for The Club.  This is a short story and you get drawn in immediately with the story of this Eliza Dolittle-ish character, Lizzie, who agrees to be auctioned off at The Club where her friend works  meaning shed be owned (again, not in a BDSM way) for 48 hours.  Lizzie is given a makeover, which actually reminds me a lot of the scene in Miss Congeniality  especially where Sandra Bullock is walking while all the guys have their jaws on the floor and then she falls.\n\nGingerly, Lizzie stoood up, wobbly until she could stand straight.  Oh, wow.  Holding her head high, she took a step.  Then another.  With just the hint of a stumble, she managed to walk a few steps on her own.  Lifting her shoulders, she smiled before walking the length of the room.  Lizzie turned around and stumbled over her feet to land in a heap on the floor.\n\nBel and Allan hurried to help her but she brushed them away, I can do this.  I can.  She clambered to stand up, smoothed down her dress and lifted her head high.  First one step and then another, she walked back to the chair before dropping into it.\n\nThis was a really good book about transformations, and obviously, falling in love.  I only wish it had gone about one more chapter, because it pretty much ended about one paragraph after they decided they wanted to stay together  it seemed a bit abrupt.  This is a smexy, heartwarming read  but be aware that there is oral, anal & m/f/m sex acts, so if any of those things bother you  youve been warned!\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\nI always find summer to be a slow time for sports.  I like baseball but I sure don't love it.  Its slow.  And hot.  And can be REALLY boring.  Thank God we have a minor league team here, because they at least have entertainment in between innings.  Now there are good things about baseball  like beer and peanuts.  But really, can anything beat football?  Big, buff men in tight pants.  NO CONTEST!  Since theres still about 3 more months until those yummilicious male thighs are once again pumping up & down the field, it was nice to get a taste of football via NIGHT GAMES & MIDNIGHT PLAY.  They are set against the backdrop of a fictional Las Vegas team, the Las Vegas Slayers, and focus on the Blue family and their football dynasty.  Dont worry  these are romances so you don't need to have a college degree in football to read them  but you do need to be old enough to deal with some of the mature (in other words, SEX) themes .  Both of these stories have subplots about toxic relationships (after reading NIGHT GAMES, youll likely want to call your own parents and thank them for being the great people they are); women breaking through the glass ceiling (NIGHT GAMES female lead, Charlotte, is the only female trainer in the league, and her sister, Danica, is the MIDNIGHT PLAYs General Manager of the Slayers), and finding the truth in themselves.\n\nOriginally posted on Snarky Mom Reads and may reference a gifted book.\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\nA Major League pitcher with a contract to renew in a year, Cole panics when the shoulder of his pitching arm becomes injured.

As a result, his brother sets him up with Everly, a physical therapy doctor candidate to help him heal without anyone knowing about the injury.

(Well, okay, so I got MINE in exchange for an honest review - but still - it IS worth the price!)  Romance, lovin', baseball - what more could you ask for?  How about a mystery, some intrigue - oh, and more lovin'?!  The dynamic of both families is interesting to watch - one family has always been comfortable financially, while Everly has supported her ailing grandfather since she was old enough to work.  While Everly is obviously a strong person with all she has persevered, what is enjoyable is to see a male character also confident enough to allow the woman to be strong.\n\nWhile this is classified as a sports romance, don't worry about the sports part if you aren't a baseball fan.

(Check her out here: [...] ) Her fourth in the series just came out a few days ago & I picked it up last night.  H.O.T. !!!  OMG!  So the title is \"Bases Loaded (Mustangs Baseball)\", and apparently it refers to a \"secret club\" that these FICTIONAL major league ballplayers have created, where there is a sexual challenge put forth to women who are invited to participate -- and the result for those who make it through all (4) bases is some jewelry pierced into some... um... personal spots.\n\nAnyway - this is the story of Antonio & Clare - Antonio is new to the Dallas Mustangs baseball club and Clare is a college music professor who moonlights as the baseball team's organist.  He catches sight of her at a fundraiser and realizes then & there that she is his soul-mate.  However, she is \"curvy\" and has massive self-esteem issues, so when he hits on her, she thinks he's being a bully & trying to humiliate her.  The resulting story is how he works through what he thinks are perverted needs for the woman who will bear his children, and she works through her body issues, as they fall in love.  Since it is the off-season, he has lots of free time in which to \"woo\" Clare.  The ultimate problem?  She wants to \"run the bases\" for his \"Bases Loaded\" sex club; he feels too possessive and they have constant clashes over this.  If you want to find out how it all shakes out... READ THE STORY!!!  (Disclaimer:  toy play, anal, m/m/m/f, light bondage.)\n\nOkay, so I'm always a vocalist about digital book pricing, so I will say that this is very well priced for the amount of pages it has - WELL worth the money!!!  This isn't SOLELY sexually based; beyond the character growth of Clare learning to like herself as she is and to realize her inner AND outer beauty, there is a female bully (& don't we ALL know some absolute BITCH who just LIVES to make others feel like crap??!!!??) who threatens public humiliation of Clare and Antonio, which would result in the loss of his contract.  Lots of angst... lots of sex... lots of self-realization that beauty isn't all about Barbie dimensions!\n\nGo read it.  It's awesome.

It is now about a month later and just the other day I felt like mayyybe the cat litter odor was coming back a little. The web site says it lasts from 30 to 150 days - so I suppose that is accurate although I had hoped it would last a little longer before I started detecting the smell again. Until I can find something that works better for $12 a month, I'll definitely keep buying this.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nThis stuff is great way to get some truffle taste without overpowering your dish.\nI just wish it were in a much better sealed container.\nI have the thing inside 2 ziploc bags and it still stinks up my spice cabinet.\nI like the smell of truffles but it got on my fiancee's nerves after a few weeks.\nOne of these days I'm going to get around putting it into a little airtight storage container.\nScore:\n4\n\nReview:\nIf you read all of the reviews & learn the tricks, you will be fine.

I use a camelbak pack for snowboarding and I never imagined they made these things or I would have never looked around.  The bite straw was just icing on the cake.  This thing is not only spill-proof, but indestructible.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nThis little kit does the job & then some. I used it for my camelbak & it worked perfectly.

If you cut whatever you nuke to the right thickness, these trays will do the rest for you.  We've done a bunch of things on these things and for the most part we were successful without too much effort. Aside from knowing how nutritious it actually is to nuke the crap out of what you want to serve, it tastes good, you can season it beforehand & it's easy to do.\nScore:\n5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

Please don't boo-hiss at me. It is a great story of survival, of overcoming loneliness, finding the basic needs for survival, and then finding companionship. Again, I have my back-up copy as long as a sun-spot doesn't happen and my electricity doesn't go out! Then I'll have to find a new way of playing a dvd! Perhaps looking once again at this wonderful movies will give me tips on how to do that.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nI actually have not watched my copy yet. I have seen this movie several times before but I always wait for that \"special moment\" to watch this one. Somewhat like the Jessica Lange King Kong movie. Takes a rainy afternoon for it.

Family Affair is on, so what is the hold up. Seems like if sex, drugs, and killing is not involved (and let us not forget about the f___ word - how did we ever talk with each other before that word made it to our top 10 list), dvd makers feel like it won't sell. Just another way for the \"money mongers\" to NOT pay attention to what the American public really like. Come on, give us a break. Put this on dvd.

I had long wanted a copy of this movie but it was either too costly or simply not available. The main story of this movie is a love story that meets cultural issues head on and, well it takes a while to deal with them, but in the end - boy gets girl. All of the other side events are interesting as well. I would very much recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you enjoyed Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nVery glad to find this on dvd from the good old days.

Before I watched the movie again, I watched all (~3 hours) of the bonus disc about Mr. Peck, his family, the making of the movie, etc. How fascinating it was. Then I watched the movie with more interest. It was a very enjoyable long afternoon. Do yourself a favor, get away from all the violence and bad language on tv of these days and put in this movie.
