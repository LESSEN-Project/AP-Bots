The U.S. and Japan accused China of trying to change the status quo by coercion and intimidation; the Chinese accused Japan and the U.S. of inciting instability with its \"20th century mentality\" of war and conflict. Following up on his comments in Singapore, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  writes in The WorldPost that China ought to abide by the rule of law in the seas of Asia and calls for negotiations.  Recalling the experience of World War II, Shanghai scholar/entrepreneur Eric X. Li  mocks Abe's pledge in Singapore that the \"new Japanese\" will help their neighbors resist Beijing. The great danger now, writes the Australian scholar Hugh White , is that the ground is being laid for a catastrophic clash since both sides in this conflict assume incorrectly that the other will back down.

Narendra Modi and his modernizing Hindu nationalist party have swept to power in India. Scorned by the West over Crimea, Vladimir Putin has hastened to deepen Russia's energy and political ties with China. China seems to be creating as many enemies as friends with its new, boldly assertive posture. Appearing at a summit of non-Western nations in Asia after cementing the giant gas deal with Russia's Putin, President Xi appealed to his neighbors to keep the U.S. out of the region and leave Asia to Asians. Yet, this came on the heels of anti-China riots in Vietnam after China placed an oil rig in disputed waters. And it came just as the U.S. government indicted individual members of a People's Liberation Army cyber-espionage team for hacking into commercial secrets of American companies.\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: The World Pivots to Asia\n\nArticle:\nOn the same day this week that President Obama announced a measure that could give legal protection to 5 million undocumented immigrants, massive protests raged across Mexico against the impunity and corruption that led to the horrific massacre of 43 students. From Mexico City, Sergio Sarmiento, Elena Poniatowska and Homero Aridjis chronicle the events and ponder what's next. Anthropologist Claudio Lomnitz examines the causes behind Mexico's corrosive impunity.\n\nMeanwhile, as Xin Chunying writes from Beijing, China is also seeking to establish the rule of law through steadily boosting the role of the National People's Congress.

It was born out of a contradiction and a paradox.\n\nThe contradiction is that while the world is growing more interdependent, the media is fragmenting -- re-nationalizing, re-localizing and even tribalizing. The resulting paradox is that the information age is becoming the age of non-communication across boundaries -- political, cultural and ideological.\n\nThe aim of The WorldPost is to help bridge this growing chasm by becoming a platform where the whole world meets; a common zone where cross-pollination of ideas and perspectives from all corners of the planet can take place.\n\nTo achieve this aim, The WorldPost strives for a global viewpoint looking around, not a national perspective looking out. Along with intelligent curation of the global news and original reportage, what distinguishes us, above all, are the first person global voices of our contributors. Every week, they weigh in as events break from Havana to Beijing, from Moscow to Mexico City, Paris, New Delhi and Abuja among so many other places.\n\nThe WorldPost seems to have met an outstanding need. Thanks to you, one year later we have reached 28 million monthly views. We've shown that the message can catch up to the medium if we put our minds to it. (continued)\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: One Year On, The WorldPost Has 28 Million Monthly Views\n\nArticle:\nBEIJING -- The title of Barack Obama's pre-presidential biography is \"The Audacity of Hope.\" Chinese President Xi Jinping has written his own document released this week -- The Communist Party's 13th five-year plan -- that might be titled \"The Audacity of the Chinese Dream.\"\n\nThis blueprint for China's future signals the most momentous shift in direction since the death of Mao and Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening up in 1978. Not a leader to rest on the laurels of his country's remarkable success so far in rising to the top ranks of the global economy, Xi wants to leap over the \"middle-income trap\" in which development becomes stuck in a low-wage manufacturing export economy. To do that, he needs to avoid, in his own words, the \"Thucydides trap\" of conflict between China as a rising power and the U.S. as the established power so instability does not disrupt growth prospects.

Narendra Modi and his modernizing Hindu nationalist party have swept to power in India. Scorned by the West over Crimea, Vladimir Putin has hastened to deepen Russia's energy and political ties with China. China seems to be creating as many enemies as friends with its new, boldly assertive posture. Appearing at a summit of non-Western nations in Asia after cementing the giant gas deal with Russia's Putin, President Xi appealed to his neighbors to keep the U.S. out of the region and leave Asia to Asians. Yet, this came on the heels of anti-China riots in Vietnam after China placed an oil rig in disputed waters. And it came just as the U.S. government indicted individual members of a People's Liberation Army cyber-espionage team for hacking into commercial secrets of American companies.\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: The World Pivots to Asia\n\nArticle:\nThis week, U.S. President Barack Obama is visiting Asia to meet U.S. allies and assure them of America's backing as China rises to become the dominant power in the region.

Just as Chinese President Xi Jinping was due to arrive in South Korea -- which is angry at Japan over denials about World War II \"comfort women\" --  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a changed interpretation of the constitution that allows Japanese military forces to operate abroad. As Shannon Tiezzi  writes, China's approach is now aimed at exploiting differences within Japanese public opinion over Abe's new nationalism.

Defiant to the end, the philosopher voluntarily drank the poison himself in a suicidal display of dignity.\n\nThis weekend, Greek voters will decide in a referendum whether they will be force-fed more painful austerity, imposed by the jury of other European democracies, or, like Socrates, administer their own poison in a \"no\" vote that will likely push Greece out of the eurozone. Tragedy, too, such as we are witnessing today, had its origins in early Greek drama.\n\nNobel Laureate Joe Stiglitz and Martin Guzman argue that Greece will be better off administering the poison by its own hand.

Following up on his comments in Singapore, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  writes in The WorldPost that China ought to abide by the rule of law in the seas of Asia and calls for negotiations.  Recalling the experience of World War II, Shanghai scholar/entrepreneur Eric X. Li  mocks Abe's pledge in Singapore that the \"new Japanese\" will help their neighbors resist Beijing. The great danger now, writes the Australian scholar Hugh White , is that the ground is being laid for a catastrophic clash since both sides in this conflict assume incorrectly that the other will back down. South Korea's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se  fears a \"Pandora's box\" is being opened in Asia. Marking the 25 years since the Tiananmen massacre, China scholar Perry Link worries that Xi Jinping is becoming \"a Mao-like strongman.\"(continued)\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: The New China Faces the 'New Japanese'\n\nArticle:\nIt takes a strong state, not (to paraphrase Hillary Clinton) a democratic village, to aggressively fight climate change. This is the inconvenient message emerging in the wake of the Xi-Obama deal on global warming announced in Beijing this week.\n\nBoth leaders will pursue executive action to fulfill their pledges. As Kerry Brown writes, Xi's decision is binding within China because a long process of consultation and consensus building within the Communist Party stands behind it. What Obama can do is up for grabs. No sooner did the pledge escape his lips than the incoming Republican majority leaders in the U.S. Congress make their own pledge to block Obama by any means necessary.\n\nIn The WorldPost this week, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim writes that the landmark Xi-Obama agreement is not only good for the environment, but also for the economy. Environmentalist Bill McKibben parses out \"what the deal is, and what it isn't.\" (continued)\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: The Inconvenient Truth About the Xi-Obama Deal -- It Takes a Strong State to Fight Climate Change\n\nArticle:\nOn the same day this week that President Obama announced a measure that could give legal protection to 5 million undocumented immigrants, massive protests raged across Mexico against the impunity and corruption that led to the horrific massacre of 43 students. From Mexico City, Sergio Sarmiento, Elena Poniatowska and Homero Aridjis chronicle the events and ponder what's next. Anthropologist Claudio Lomnitz examines the causes behind Mexico's corrosive impunity.\n\nMeanwhile, as Xin Chunying writes from Beijing, China is also seeking to establish the rule of law through steadily boosting the role of the National People's Congress. While stifling dissent, China's President Xi is taking on both \"tigers and flies\" in his no-holds-barred assault from the top down on corruption.\n\nCan China's effort succeed without active public engagement? Can Mexico learn from China and move from angry protest to systemic change? (continued)\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: Is China Outpacing Mexico on the Rule of Law?\n\nArticle:\nThis week, U.S. President Barack Obama is visiting Asia to meet U.S. allies and assure them of America's backing as China rises to become the dominant power in the region. In light of the West's weak response to Putin's takeover of the Crimea, some Asian allies are concerned about whether the U.S. will stand steady in the event a conflict breaks out between one of its allies and China.\nTitle:\nObama's Asian Pivot: A WorldPost Review\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, generate a title for the given article by the same author.

Not a leader to rest on the laurels of his country's remarkable success so far in rising to the top ranks of the global economy, Xi wants to leap over the \"middle-income trap\" in which development becomes stuck in a low-wage manufacturing export economy. To do that, he needs to avoid, in his own words, the \"Thucydides trap\" of conflict between China as a rising power and the U.S. as the established power so instability does not disrupt growth prospects.

As Julian Baggini writes, what is certain is that America, like much of Europe, is experiencing a mutiny against the status quo. The populist revolt against political and economic elites is spreading across borders everywhere except -- so far -- East Asia, where the prospects of the average person have risen instead of fallen over the past decade. (continued)\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: Mutiny Against the Status Quo\n\nArticle:\nNo sooner did the global elites leave their annual talking shop high in the Alps at Davos last week than the people spoke in Greece. In a mutiny against an untenable status quo, those who are run over have revolted against those who run things. Now righteous populism must face economic, financial and political realities if other European states don't bend Greece's way.\n\nTo keep up with the drama as it evolves over the coming weeks, we've connected WorldPost readers directly to the daily blog of Yanis Varoufakis, the self-described \"erratic Marxist\" who is now Greece's finance minister. Writing from Athens, HuffPost Greece Editorial Director Sophia Papaioannou says Alexis Tsipras' electoral victory will give suffering Greeks \"space and time\" to address their predicament. Former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou argues that the path forward after the election is for a national referendum on a \"Greek plan\" for reform that will bind a now polarized nation. Rena Dourou, a deputy of the victorious Syriza party, notes that the vote was as much against the corruption of the formerly ruling political parties in Greece as it was against austerity.
