Inspiring from the human's capability of compensating visual information (looking) with audio information(hearing), a visual-audio integrating method is proposed to reduce the disturbance of light noise and to improve the recognition accuracy. Combining with the PCA-based face recognition, a two-stage speaker recognition algorithm is used to extract useful personal identity information from speech signals. With the measurement of visual background noise, the visual-audio integrating method is performed to draw the final decision. The proposed method is evaluated on a public visual-audio dataset VidTIMIT and a partner robot authentication system. The results verified the visual-audio integrating method can obtain satisfied recognition results with strong robustness.\nTitle:\nVisual-audio integration for user authentication system of partner robots\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, the write-to-MRAM process is relatively slow and results in high dynamic power consumption. Such inherent disadvantages of MRAM make researchers easily conclude that MRAM can only be used for low-level caches (e.g., L2 or L3 cache), where cache memories are less frequently accessed and slow write to MRAM can be more easily compensated using simple architectural techniques. By developing a hybrid cache architecture, this paper attempts to show that, with appropriate architecture design, MRAM can also be used in L1 cache to improve both the energy efficiency and soft error immunity. The basic idea is to supplement the MRAM L1 cache with several small SRAM buffers, which can substantially mitigate the performance degradation and dynamic energy overhead induced by MRAM write operations. Moreover, the proposed hybrid cache architecture is also an efficient solution to protect cache memory from radiation-induced soft errors, as MRAM is inherently invulnerable to emissive particles. Simulation results show that, with only less than 2% performance degradation, the proposed design approach can reduce the power consumption by up to 76.1% on average compared with the traditional SRAM L1 cache. In addition, the architectural vulnerability factor of L1 data cache is reduced from 28.3% to as low as 0.5%.\nTitle:\nUsing Magnetic RAM to Build Low-Power and Soft Error-Resilient L1 Cache\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The proposed method is based an a mew data structure, called the framed-quadtree, which combines together the accuracy of high resolution grid-based path planning techniques with the efficiency of quadtree-based techniques, hence having the advantages of both. The heart of this method is a linear time algorithm for computing certain special dynamic Voronoi diagrams, The proposed method does not place any unrealistic constraints on obstacles or on the environment and represents an improvement in accuracy and efficiency over traditional path planning approaches in this area.\nTitle:\nA Framed-Quadtree Approach For Determining Euclidean Shortest Paths In A 2-D Environment\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Tags are used for navigation, finding resources and serendipitous browsing and thus provide an immediate benefit for users. These systems usually include tag recommendation mechanisms easing the process of finding good tags for a resource, but also consolidating the tag vocabulary across users. In practice, however, only very basic recommendation strategies are applied. In this paper we evaluate and compare several recommendation algorithms on large-scale real life datasets: an adaptation of user-based collaborative filtering, a graph-based recommender built on top of the FolkRank algorithm, and simple methods based on counting tag occurrences. We show that both FolkRank and collaborative filtering provide better results than non-personalized baseline methods. Moreover, since methods based on counting tag occurrences are computationally cheap, and thus usually preferable for real time scenarios, we discuss simple approaches for improving the performance of such methods. We show, how a simple recommender based on counting tags from users and resources can perform almost as good as the best recommender.\nTitle:\nTag recommendations in social bookmarking systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Web developers must ensure that data input by the user is validated for correctness. Given the importance of form validation it must be considered as part of a model-driven solution to web development. Existing model-driven approaches typically have not addressed form validation as part of the model. In this paper, we present an approach that allows validation constraints to be captured within a model using UML and OCL. Our approach covers three common types of validation: single element, multiple element, and entity association.

As they roam around in the physical world while accessing online services via mobile devices, users also leave a series of \"footprints\" -- i.e., hints about their physical locations - in the physical world. This poses a potent new threat to user privacy: one can potentially correlate the \"fingerprints\" left by the users in the cyberspace with \"footprints\" left in the physical world to infer and reveal leakage of user physical world privacy, such as frequent user locations or mobility trajectories in the physical world - we refer to this problem as user physical world privacy leakage via user cyberspace privacy leakage. In this paper we address the following fundamental question: what kind - and how much - of user physical world privacy might be leaked if we could get hold of such diverse network datasets even without any physical location information. In order to conduct an in-depth investigation of these questions, we utilize the network data collected via a DPI system at the routers within one of the largest Internet operator in Shanghai, China over a duration of one month. We decompose the fundamental question into the three problems: i) linkage of various online user IDs belonging to the same person via mobility pattern mining; ii) physical location classification via aggregate user mobility patterns over time; and iii) tracking user physical mobility. By developing novel and effective methods for solving each of these problems, we demonstrate that the question of user physical world privacy leakage via user cyberspace privacy leakage is not hypothetical, but indeed poses a real potent threat to user privacy.\n\n\nTitle:\nFrom Fingerprint to Footprint: Revealing Physical World Privacy Leakage by Cyberspace Cookie Logs.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this work we look at the combined problem of multi-path routing and bandwidth allocation such that the flow allocation for each connection will be maximized and fairness will be maintained. We use the weighted extension of the max-min criterion to allocate bandwidth in proportion to the flows' demand. Our contribution is an algorithm which, for the first time, solves the combined routing and bandwidth allocation problem for the case where flows are allowed to be splitted along several paths. We use multi commodity flow (MCF) formulation which is solved using linear programming (LP) techniques. These building blocks are used by our algorithm to derive the required optimal routing and allocation.\nTitle:\nMaximum Flow Routing with Weighted Max-Min Fairness\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The proposed image acquisition process is utilized by a computer supported imaging system implementing the acquisition and analysis of skin lesion images supporting medical diagnosis. in addition the same approach may be used for several problems requiring reliable color measurement and object identification. Two methodologies are adopted: The Bayesian Networks, which provide an efficient way of reasoning under uncertainty and are used to incorporate the expert judgement into the estimation of the probability of successful operation, and a Markov chain approach, which is generally used for the dynamic modeling of the system behavior. The Markov chain model requires asymptotically the solution of sparse linear systems. Explicit preconditioned methods are used for the efficient solution of the derived sparse linear system, and the parallel implementation of the dominant computational part is exploited.\nTitle:\nComputing the success factors in consistent acquisition and recognition of objects in color digital images by explicit preconditioning\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, the high static power of the photonic components (e.g. laser source, resonators and waveguides) often results in energy-inefficient architectures. In this paper, we advocate the Energy-Star Photonic Network (ESPN) architecture that optimizes energy utilization via a two-pronged approach: (1) by enabling dynamic resource provisioning, ESPN adapts photonic network resources based on runtime traffic characteristics and (2) by utilizing all-optical adaptive routing, ESPN improves energy efficiency by intelligently exploiting existing network resources without introducing high latency and power hungry auxiliary routing mechanisms. Our evaluation results show that compared to the baseline design, ESPN reduces power and energy consumption under synthetic traffic patterns by 50% and 58% respectively.\n\n\nTitle:\nESPN: a case for energy-star photonic on-chip network\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This digital system enables the design of stable synthesis filters using existing control theory tools such as model-matching and linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the induced error is robust against delay estimate errors.

These personal devices provide interactive displays as well as numerous sensors to effectuate gestures for input. We examine the possibility of using surface and motion gestures on mobile devices for interacting with 3D objects on large surfaces. If effective use of such devices is possible over large displays, then users can collaborate and carry out complex 3D manipulation tasks, which are not trivial to do. In an attempt to generate design guidelines for this type of interaction, we conducted a guessability study with a dual-surface concept device, which provides users access to information through both its front and back. We elicited a set of end-user surface- and motion-based gestures. Based on our results, we demonstrate reasonably good agreement between gestures for choice of sensory (i.e. tilt), multi-touch and dual-surface input. In this paper we report the results of the guessability study and the design of the gesture-based interface for 3D manipulation.\nTitle:\nUser-defined surface+motion gestures for 3d manipulation of objects at a distance through a mobile device\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

There are two important open questions here. The first challenge is the measure - how to quantify the goodness of a given top-k ranking list that captures both the relevance and the diversity? The second challenge lies in the algorithmic aspect - how to find an optimal, or near-optimal, top-k ranking list that maximizes the measure we defined in a scalable way? In this paper, we address these challenges from an optimization point of view. Firstly, we propose a goodness measure for a given top-k ranking list. The proposed goodness measure intuitively captures both (a) the relevance between each individual node in the ranking list and the query; and (b) the diversity among different nodes in the ranking list. Moreover, we propose a scalable algorithm (linear wrt the size of the graph) that generates a provably near-optimal solution. The experimental evaluations on real graphs demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.\nTitle:\nDiversified ranking on large graphs: an optimization viewpoint\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The meta-data is typically organized into a domain ontology where key concepts and relations from the domain appear. The benefits of such a representation are manifold: a more topical information seeking process, better content adaptation and higher interoperability even on the current, still largely syntactical, Web, to name only a few. As the SW is, arguably, the future of the Web, it is only too natural that Web mining, i.e., the application of data mining techniques to web-related data, tackles the processing semantically annotated data. In this context, we study the detecting of typical navigation scenarios on an ontology-powered Web portal, i.e., an instance of usage mining on the SW. In the present paper, we tackle the fundamental aspects of the underlying mining problem and clarify the impact a fully-fledged ontology has on the data and pattern languages. Indeed, current ontology-aware mining approaches tend to limit their scope to the core conceptual hierarchy (taxonomy) of an ontology whereas in a realistic settings there will be a lot more knowledge in the ontology, in particular, on semantic relations between domain concepts, the way they instantiate into links between content objects, etc. We show that reflecting domain relations in the navigation patterns results in a new pattern structure that combines elements from sequential, generalized and graph pattern mining and therefore requires a dedicated mining strategy. After characterizing the underlying pattern space, we describe a dedicated level-wise mining method and present some empirical evidence of its viability.\nTitle:\nA framework for mining meaningful usage patterns within a semantically enhanced web portal\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The input is a complete graph and two values on each edge (a weight and a length) which satisfy the triangle inequality. It is unlikely that every instance admits a matching with maximum weight and maximum length at the same time. Therefore, we look for a compromise solution, i.e. a matching that simultaneously approximates the best weight and the best length. For which approximation ratio can we guarantee that any instance admits a -approximate matching? We propose a general method which relies on the existence of an approximate matching in any graph of small size. An algorithm for computing a 1/3-approximate matching in any instance is provided. The algorithm uses an analytical result stating that every instance on at most 6 nodes must admit a 1/2-approximate matching. We extend our analysis with a computer-aided approach for larger graphs, indicating that the general method may produce a 2/5-approximate matching. We conjecture that a 1/2-approximate matching exists in any bi-objective instance satisfying the triangle inequality.\nTitle:\nBi-objective matchings with the triangle inequality.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Cooperative hardware and software approaches for error tolerance can solve this hardware reliability challenge. Cross-layer fault tolerance frameworks expose hardware failures to upper-layers, like the compiler, to help correct faults. Such cooperative approaches require less hardware complexity than masking all faults at the hardware level and are generally more energy efficient. This paper provides a detailed design and an implementation study of cross-layer fault tolerance for supercomputing. Since supercomputers necessarily involve large component counts, they have more frequent failures than consumer electronics and small systems. Conventionally, these systems use redundancy and check pointing to achieve reliable computing. However, redundancy increases acquisition as well as recurring energy costs. This paper describes a simple language-level mechanism coupled with complementary compilation and lightweight hardware error detection that provides efficient reliability and cross-layer fault-tolerance for supercomputers. Our evaluation focuses on strong scaling problems for which we can trade computing power for redundancy. Our results show a range of 1.07\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7 speedup when employing cross-layer error-tolerance compared to conventional full dual modular redundancy (DMR) to contain all errors within hardware. Further, we demonstrate the approach can sustain 7% to 50% lower energy. The most important result of this work is qualitative: we can use a simplified hardware design with relaxed architectural correctness guarantees.\nTitle:\nMechanisms and Evaluation of Cross-Layer Fault-Tolerance for Supercomputing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Specifically, a mobile user equipment (UE) transmits in D2D mode if the received signal strength (RSS) from the nearest base station (BS) is less than a specified threshold $beta ge 0$; otherwise, it connects to the nearest BS and transmits in cellular mode. The RSS-threshold-based setting is general in the sense that by varying $beta$ from $beta = 0$ to $beta = infty$, the network accordingly evolves from a traditional cellular network (including only cellular mode) toward a wireless ad hoc network (including only D2D mode). We provide a unified framework to analyze the downlink outage probability in a multichannel environment with Rayleigh fading, where the spatial distributions of BSs and UEs are well explicitly accounted for by utilizing stochastic geometry. We derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability of a generic UE and that in both cellular mode and D2D mode and quantify the performance gains in outage probability that can be obtained by allowing such RSS-threshold-based D2D communications. We show that increasing the number of channels, although able to support more cellular UEs, may result in an increase of outage probability in the D2D-enabled cellular network. The corresponding condition and reason are also identified by applying our framework.\nTitle:\nOn the Outage Probability of Device-to-Device-Communication-Enabled Multichannel Cellular Networks: An RSS-Threshold-Based Perspective\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The prescribed course of action is based on an assessment of patient risk-patients at higher risk are given more and faster attention. It is also sequential- it is too expensive to immediately order all tests which might later be of value. This paper presents two methods that together improve the accuracy of backprop nets on a pneumonia risk assessment problem by 10-50%. Rankprop improves on backpropagation with sum of squares error in ranking patients by risk. Multitask learning takes advantage of future lab tests available in the training set, but not available in practice when predictions must be made.

The proposed object tracking procedure can be divided into two steps: (i) optical flow-based tracking of feature points and (ii) NPT-AFM for robust tracking. In order to handle occlusion problems in object tracking. feature points inside an object are estimated instead of its shape boundary of the conventional active contour model (ACM) or active shape model (ASM), and are updated as an element of the training set for the AFM. The proposed NPT-AFM framework enables the tracking of occluded objects in complicated background.

However, due to an inability to capture fibres in detail by conventional imaging, most current models assume simple fibre distributions. These are often registered from a minimal set of contrived templates. To improve realism, we propose to use detailed fibre fields, digitized from a cadaver, for defining the internal muscle structure in models. We present a workflow for registering these detailed digitized descriptions to subject-specific muscle geometries, which can then be incorporated into the FE model for use with a transversely isotropic constitutive law. The importance of capturing this detail is emphasized with two examples of muscle groups found in the forearm: the extensor carpi radialis longus and the flexor digitorum superficialis. We show that simplified fibre fields can lead to a 10-20% difference in predicted muscle force and equally significant differences in contracted geometries.\nTitle:\nEmbedding Digitized Fibre Fields In Finite Element Models Of Muscles\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To reduce computational complexity, the existing fast search algorithms move iteratively toward the winning point based only on a finite set of search points in every stage. Despite the efficiency of these algorithms, the search process is easily trapped into local minima, especially for high activity video sequences. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a three-states Markov model based algorithm that invokes the fuzzy-reasoning to provide the search an acceptance probability of being able to move out of local minima. Two schemes are employed to further enhance the performance of the algorithm. First, a set of initial search points that exploit high correlations among the motion vectors of the temporally and spatially adjacent blocks as well as their surrounding points are used. Second, an alternate search strategy is addressed to cover more area without increasing computations. Simulation results show that the new algorithm offers superior performance with lower computational complexity and picture quality increase in terms of search points/block and MSE/pel, respectively, compared with the previous works in various scenarios.\nTitle:\nMarkov model fuzzy-reasoning based algorithm for fast block motion estimation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

While correctness is an important issue, the adoption of policy-based computing may be limited if the resulting systems are not implemented efficiently and thus perform poorly. To increase the effectiveness and adoption of policy-based computing, in this paper, we propose fast policy evaluation algorithms that can be adapted to support various policy languages. In this paper, we focus on XACML policy evaluation because XACML has become the de facto standard for specifying access control policies, has been widely used on web servers, and is most complex among existing policy languages. We implemented our algorithms in a policy evaluation system called XEngine and conducted side-by-side comparison with Sun Policy Decision Point (PDP), the industrial standard for XACML policy evaluation. The results show that XEngine is orders of magnitude faster than Sun PDP. The performance difference grows almost linearly with the number of rules in an XACML policy. To our best knowledge, there is no prior work on improving XACML policy evaluation performance. This paper represents the first step in exploring this unknown space.\nTitle:\nDesigning Fast and Scalable XACML Policy Evaluation Engines\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The proposed method detects spatial cropping and temporal jittering in a video, yet is robust against frame dropping in the streaming video scenario. In our scheme, the authentication signature is compact and independent of the size of the video. Given a video, we identify the key frames based on differential energy between the frames. Considering video frames as shares, we compute the corresponding secret at three hierarchical levels. The master secret is used as digital signature to authenticate the video. The proposed signature scheme is scalable to three hierarchical levels of signature computation based on the needs of different scenarios. We provide extensive experimental results to show the utility of our technique in three different scenarios--streaming video, video identification and face tampering.\nTitle:\nA scalable signature scheme for video authentication\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The proposed method is a projector-camera system that reconstructs a shape from a single image where a static pattern is cast by a projector, such a method is ideal for acquisition of moving objects at a high frame rate. The issues tackled in this paper are as follows: 1) realize one-shot 3D reconstruction with a single-colored pattern, and 2) obtain accurate shapes by finding correspondences in sub-pixel accuracy. To achieve these goals, we propose the following methods: 1) implicit encoding of projector information by a grid of wave lines, 2) grid-based stereo between projector pattern and camera images to determine unique correspondences, 3) (quasi-)pixel-wise interpolations and optimizations to reconstruct dense shapes, and 4) a single-colored pattern contributes to simplify pattern projecting devices compared to color-coded methods.

The model recursively composes the vector of a parent phrase from those of child words or phrases, with a key component named composition function. Although a variety of composition functions have been proposed, the syntactic information has not been fully encoded in the composition process. We propose two models, Tag Guided RNN (TG-RNN for short) which chooses a composition function according to the part-of-speech tag of a phrase, and Tag Embedded RNN/RNTN (TE-RNN/RNTN for short) which learns tag embeddings and then combines tag and word embeddings together. In the fine-grained sentiment classification, experiment results show the proposed models obtain remarkable improvement: TG-RNN/TE-RNN obtain remarkable improvement over baselines, TE-RNTN obtains the second best result among all the top performing models, and all the proposed models have much less parameters/complexity than their counter-parts.\nTitle:\nLearning Tag Embeddings And Tag-Specific Composition Functions In Recursive Neural Network\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In a PCA-based anomaly detection, outliers, anomalies with excessively large traffic volume, may contaminate the subspaces and degrade the performance of the detector. To solve this problem, robust PCA methods have been studied. In a robust PCA-based anomaly detection scheme, outliers can be removed from the measured traffic data before constructing the subspaces. Although the robust PCA methods are promising, they incure high computational cost to obtain the optimal location vector and scatter matrix for the subspace. We propose a novel anomaly detection scheme by extending the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator, a robust PCA method. The proposed scheme utilizes the daily periodicity in traffic volume and attempts to detect anomalies for every period of measured traffic. In each period, before constructing the subspace, outliers are removed from the measured traffic data by using a location vector and a scatter matrix obtained in the preceding period. We validate the proposed scheme by applying it to measured traffic data in the Abiline network. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme provides robust anomaly detection with less computational cost.\nTitle:\nTraffic Anomaly Detection Based On Robust Principal Component Analysis Using Periodic Traffic Behavior\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, the root cause of the correlation between routing dynamics and such performance degradation is poorly understood. In particular, how do routing changes result in degraded end-to-end path performance in the first place? How do factors such as topological properties, routing policies, and iBGP configurations affect the extent to which such routing events can cause performance degradation? Answers to these questions are critical for improving network performance.In this paper, we conduct extensive measurement that involves both controlled routing updates through two tier-1 ISPs and active probes of a diverse set of end-to-end paths on the Internet. We find that routing changes contribute to end-to-end packet loss significantly. Specifically, we study failover events in which a link failure leads to a routing change and recovery events in which a link repair causes a routing change. In both cases, it is possible to experience data plane performance degradation in terms of increased long loss burst as well as forwarding loops. Furthermore, we find that common routing policies and iBGP configurations of ISPs can directly affect the end-to-end path performance during routing changes. Our work provides new insights into potential measures that network operators can undertake to enhance network performance.\nTitle:\nA measurement study on the impact of routing events on end-to-end internet path performance\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In applications, test costs and misclassification costs should be considered while inducing decision trees. Recently, some cost-sensitive learning algorithms based on ID3 such as CS-ID3, IDX, \\lambda-ID3 have been proposed to deal with the issue. These algorithms deal with only symbolic data. In this paper, we develop a decision tree algorithm inspired by C4.5 for numeric data. There are two major issues for our algorithm. First, we develop the test cost weighted information gain ratio as the heuristic information. According to this heuristic information, our algorithm is to pick the attribute that provides more gain ratio and costs less for each selection. Second, we design a post-pruning strategy through considering the tradeoff between test costs and misclassification costs of the generated decision tree. In this way, the total cost is reduced. Experimental results indicate that (1) our algorithm is stable and effective; (2) the post-pruning technique reduces the total cost significantly; (3) the competition strategy is effective to obtain a cost-sensitive decision tree with low cost. \nTitle:\nCost-sensitive C4.5 with post-pruning and competition\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This work examines how path information in XML can be utilized to speed up the structural join operation. We introduce a novel approach to pre-filter path expressions and identify a minimal set of candidate elements for the structural join. The proposed solution comprises of a path-based node labeling scheme and a path join algorithm. The former associates every node in an XML document with its path type, while the latter greatly reduces the cost of subsequent element node join by filtering out elements with irrelevant path types. Comparative experiments with the state-of-the-art holistic join algorithm clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach is efficient and scalable for queries ranging from simple paths to complex branch queries.\nTitle:\nA path-based labeling scheme for efficient structural join\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Then we propose a new multi-level user profiling model by integrating tags and ratings to achieve personalized search, which can reflect not only the user's favor but also a user's nuisances.

The predominant search schemes in unstructured P2P systems have their problems: flooding creates excessive traffic overhead and random walk prolongs search delay. Moreover, both use uniform time-to-live (TTL) control for all users, which makes them vulnerable to selfish user attacks, and results in the \"free-riding\" and \"tragedy of the commons\" problems. In this paper, we propose a budget-based self-optimized incentive search (BuSIS) protocol for unstructured P2P file sharing systems, which is robust to and restricts selfish user behaviors. Furthermore, our protocol lowers the search overhead while keeping high hit rate. BuSIS provides differentiated search service for selfish users and ties a user's contribution to its service level. We present the analytical models on expected search performance, associated search cost and the user satisfaction level. Extensive emulations have been conducted at large scale network scenarios to compare performance of BuSIS with flooding and random walk searches with and without selfish user behaviors. The experimental results show that BuSIS always has the lowest search overhead without sacrificing the hit rate. When serving selfish users, flooding and random walk performance degrade dramatically, while BuSIS gracefully keeps the hit rate only with 20% overhead of flooding and 25% of random walk.\nTitle:\nBudget-Based Self-Optimized Incentive Search in Unstructured P2P Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Initially the members of an initial set (Ssubseteq V) are influenced. During each subsequent round, the set of influenced nodes is augmented by including every node v that has at least t(v) previously influenced neighbours. The general problem is to find a small initial set that influences the whole network. In this paper we extend this model by using incentives to reduce the thresholds of some nodes. The goal is to minimize the total of the incentives required to ensure that the process completes within a given number of rounds. The problem is hard to approximate in general networks.

Predictable system design is concerned with the challenge of building systems for which timing requirements can be guaranteed a priori. Perhaps paradoxically, this problem has become more difficult by the introduction of performance-enhancing architectural elements, such as caches, pipelines, and multithreading, which introduce a large degree of uncertainty and make guarantees harder to provide. The intention of this article is to summarize the current state of the art in research concerning how to build predictable yet performant systems. We suggest precise definitions for the concept of \u201cpredictability\u201d, and present predictability concerns at different abstraction levels in embedded system design. First, we consider timing predictability of processor instruction sets. Thereafter, we consider how programming languages can be equipped with predictable timing semantics, covering both a language-based approach using the synchronous programming paradigm, as well as an environment that provides timing semantics for a mainstream programming language (in this case C). We present techniques for achieving timing predictability on multicores. Finally, we discuss how to handle predictability at the level of networked embedded systems where randomly occurring errors must be considered.\nTitle:\nBuilding timing predictable embedded systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we propose a power management scheme for FPGAs centered on a power-driven partitioning technique. Our power-driven partitioner creates clusters within a design such that within individual clusters, power consumption can be improved via voltage scaling. We tested the effectiveness of our approach on a set of LUT-level benchmark netlists. Further we did constrained placement of the clusters into predefined V-dd(high) and V-dd(low) regions for a single FPGA. Average savings in power consumption with our approach is 48% whereas penalty in channel width and wire length due to constrained placement is 23% and 26% respectively.\nTitle:\nPower-Driven Design Partitioning\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Fraud behaviors seriously damage the ranking system of e-commerce platforms and adversely influence the shopping experience of users. It is of great practical value to detect fraud behaviors on e-commerce platforms. However, the task is non-trivial, since the adversarial action taken by fraudsters. Existing fraud detection systems used in the e-commerce industry easily suffer from performance decay and can not adapt to the upgrade of fraud patterns, as they take already known fraud behaviors as supervision information to detect other suspicious behaviors.In this article, we propose a competitive graph neural networks (CGNN)-based fraud detection system (eFraudCom) to detect fraud behaviors at one of the largest e-commerce platforms, \u201cTaobao\u201d1. In the eFraudCom system, (1) the competitive graph neural networks (CGNN) as the core part of eFraudCom can classify behaviors of users directly by modeling the distributions of normal and fraud behaviors separately; (2) some normal behaviors will be utilized as weak supervision information to guide the CGNN to build the profile for normal behaviors that are more stable than fraud behaviors. The algorithm dependency on fraud behaviors will be eliminated, which enables eFraudCom to detect fraud behaviors in presence of the new fraud patterns; (3) the mutual information regularization term can maximize the separability between normal and fraud behaviors to further improve CGNN. eFraudCom is implemented into a prototype system and the performance of the system is evaluated by extensive experiments. The experiments on two Taobao and two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed deep framework CGNN is superior to other baselines in detecting fraud behaviors. A case study on Taobao datasets verifies that CGNN is still robust when the fraud patterns have been upgraded.\nTitle:\neFraudCom: An E-commerce Fraud Detection System via Competitive Graph Neural Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Recent works by Cong, Kong and Pan [5] and Tang and Wong [18] give algorithms to solve the buffer block planning problem. In this paper, we address the problem of how to perform buffering of global multiterminal nets given an existing buffer block plan. We give a provably good algorithm based on a recent approach of Garg and K\u8070nemann [8] and Fleischer [7] (see also Albrecht [1] and Dragan et al. [6]). Our method routes connections using available buffer blocks, such that required upper and lower bounds on buffer intervals - as well as wirelength upper bounds per connection - are satisfied. In addition, our algorithm allows more than one buffer to be inserted into any given connection and observes buffer parity constraints. Most importantly, and unlike previous works on the problem [5, 18, 6], we take into account multiterminal nets. Our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms for the problem [5, 6], which are based on 2-pin decompositions of the nets. The algorithm has been validated on top-level layouts extracted from a recent high-end microprocessor design.\nTitle:\nProvably good global buffering by multi-terminal multicommodity flow approximation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Since multiple guest virtual machines (DomUs) are running on a single physical device, disk I/O fairness among DomUs and aggregated throughput remain the challenges in virtualized environments. Although several methods have been developed for disk I/O performance virtualization among multiple DomUs, most of them suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks. (1) A fair scheduling mechanism is missing when requests converge together from multiple queues. (2) Existing methods rely on better performance of the underlying storage system such as Solid State Drive (SSD). (3) Throughput and latency are not considered simultaneously. To address these disadvantages, this paper presents a Virtual Multi-Channel of Disk I/O (VMCD) method that can be built on top of an ordinary storage utility, which mitigates the interference among multiple DomUs by using separated virtual channel (V-Channel) and an I/O request queue for each DomU. In our VMCD, several mechanisms are employed to enhance the I/O performance, including a credit allocation mechanism, a global monitoring strategy, and a virtual multi-channel fair scheduling algorithm. The proposed techniques are implemented on the Xen virtual disk and evaluated on Linux guest operating systems. Experiments results show that VMCD increases fairness by 70% approximately compared with CFQ and Anticipatory schedulers, by 30% approximately compared with Deadline scheduler; and enhances bandwidth utilization by 28% approximately compared with CFQ and Anticipatory schedulers, by 37% compared with Deadline in the case of three or more virtual DomUs running on the same physical host.\nTitle:\nVMCD: A Virtual Multi-Channel Disk I/O Scheduling Method for Virtual Machines\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For example, LinkedIn publishes a large amount of messages either about people who want to seek jobs or companies who want to recruit new members. By collecting information, we can have a better understanding of the job market and provide insights to job-seekers, companies and even decision makers. In this paper, we analyze the job information from the social network point of view. We first collect the job-related information from various social media sources. Then we construct an inter-company job-hopping network, with the vertices denoting companies and the edges denoting flow of personnel between companies. We subsequently employ graphmining techniques to mine influential companies and related company groups based on the job-hopping network model. Demonstration on LinkedIn data shows that our system JobMiner can provide a better understanding of the dynamic processes and a more accurate identification of important entities in the job market.\nTitle:\nJobMiner: a real-time system for mining job-related patterns from social media\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Processors may fail by permanent crashing. We investigate the time and the work complexity of F-reliable protocols for the DO-ALL problem on 1-hop wireless networks without collision detection. An F-reliable protocol is a protocol that guarantees the execution of all tasks if at most F p faults happen during its execution. Previous results for this model are known only for the case F = p - 1.We obtain the following tight bounds. - The completion time of F-reliable protocols on 1-hop wireless networks without collision detection is &Theta(t/p - F + min {tF/p, F + \u9a74t}). - The work complexity of F-reliable protocols on 1-hop wireless networks without collision detection is \u9a74(t + F \u9a74 min{t, F}).

Following this approach, many proofs of results are tightly bound to the characteristics of the computation model and of its restrictions and, therefore, they sometimes hide the essential properties which insure the obtained results. In order to obtain more general results, a uniform family of computation models which encompasses most of the complexity classes of interest is introduced. As a first initial set of results derivable from the proposed approach, we will give a sufficient and necessary condition for proving separations of relativized complexity classes, a characterization of complexity classes with complete languages and a sufficient condition for proving strong separations of relativized complexity classes. Examples of applications of these results to some specific complexity classes are then given.

Energy harvesting from thermal sources such as body heat and mechanical sources such as human motion have been proposed. There are also sensor network systems that harvest energy from the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, ambient light levels in indoor environments are typically significantly lower than those found outdoors and highly dependent on the nature of the indoor environment considered. Recently, low-power clock synchronization using electromagnetic energy radiating from AC power lines was proposed. In this paper, we go a step ahead and try to answer the question: Can energy be harvested from the electromagnetic energy radiating from AC power lines and use it to operate a wireless sensor network with a low duty-cycle?

In this algorithm, each individual is called a branch, and the sampled points are regarded as the branch growing trajectory. Phototropism operator is designed to introduce the fitness function value, and it is also used to decide the growing direction. In this paper, we apply APPM algorithm to train the connection weights for ANN. To assess the performance of our APPM-trained ANN (APPMANN), two real-world problems, named Cleveland heart disease classification problem and sunspot number forecasting problem, are adopted. Simulation results show that APPMANN increases the performance significantly when compared with other sophisticated machine learning techniques proposed in recent years.\nTitle:\nTraining artificial neural networks using APPM\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this article, a cooperative caching architecture of UAV and UTs with scalable video coding (SVC) is proposed, which provides the high transmission rate content delivery and personalized video viewing qualities in hotspot areas. In the proposed cache-enabling UAV-D2D networks, we formulate a joint optimization problem of UT caching placement, UAV trajectory, and UAV caching placement to maximize the cache utility. To solve this challenging mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, the optimization problem is decomposed into three sub-problems. Specifically, we obtain UT caching placement by a many-to-many swap matching algorithm, then obtain the UAV trajectory and UAV caching placement by approximate convex optimization and dynamic programming, respectively. Finally, we propose a low complexity iterative algorithm for the formulated optimization problem to improve the system capacity, fully utilize the cache space resource, and provide diverse delivery qualities for video traffic. Simulation results reveal that: i) the proposed cooperative caching architecture of UAV and UTs obtains larger cache utility than the cache-enabling UAV networks with same data storage capacity and radio resource; ii) compared with the benchmark algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves cache utility and reduces backhaul offloading ratio effectively.\nTitle:\nJoint Optimization of Caching Placement and Trajectory for UAV-D2D Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We develop a distributed on-demand multipath routing protocol for MANETs capable of finding spatially disjoint paths without location information. The use of spatially disjoint routes in multipath routing is important due to the non-interfering nature of the paths. This enables applications such as load-balancing, bandwidth aggregation, secure communications and multimedia transmission. Most of the proposed multipath protocols for MANETs focus on reliability and are not adequate for these types of applications because of route coupling between alternate paths. We propose Spatially Disjoint Multipath Routing (SDMR) protocol, capable of finding multiple paths in one route discovery, measuring the distance between them and choosing paths with most separation. SDMR is evaluated through simulation.\nTitle:\nSpatially Disjoint Multipath Routing protocol without location information\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, the weight decay effect decreases linearly as the number of learning epochs increases. Although we can modify the original RLS algorithm to maintain a constant weight decay effect, the computational and space complexities of the modified RLS algorithm are very high. This paper first presents a set of more compact RLS equations for this modified RLS algorithm. Afterwards, to reduce the computational and space complexities, we propose a decoupled version for this algorithm. The effectiveness of this decoupled algorithm is demonstrated by computer simulations.\nTitle:\nDecouple implementation of weight decay for recursive least square.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We consider the framework to use the world knowledge as indirect supervision. World knowledge is general-purpose knowledge, which is not designed for any specific domain. Then the key challenges are how to adapt the world knowledge to domains and how to represent it for learning. In this paper, we provide an example of using world knowledge for domain dependent document clustering. We provide three ways to specify the world knowledge to domains by resolving the ambiguity of the entities and their types, and represent the data with world knowledge as a heterogeneous information network. Then we propose a clustering algorithm that can cluster multiple types and incorporate the sub-type information as constraints. In the experiments, we use two existing knowledge bases as our sources of world knowledge. One is Freebase, which is collaboratively collected knowledge about entities and their organizations. The other is YAGO2, a knowledge base automatically extracted from Wikipedia and maps knowledge to the linguistic knowledge base, WordNet. Experimental results on two text benchmark datasets (20newsgroups and RCV1) show that incorporating world knowledge as indirect supervision can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms as well as clustering algorithms enhanced with world knowledge features.\n\n\nTitle:\nIncorporating World Knowledge to Document Clustering via Heterogeneous Information Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The victim is tricked into entering such information on a web page that is crafted by the attacker so that it mimics a legitimate page. Recent statistics about the increasing number of phishing attacks suggest that this security problem still deserves significant attention. In this paper, we present a novel technique to visually compare a suspected phishing page with the legitimate one. The goal is to determine whether the two pages are suspiciously similar. We identify and consider three page features that play a key role in making a phishing page look similar to a legitimate one. These features are text pieces and their style, images embedded in the page, and the overall visual appearance of the page as rendered by the browser. To verify the feasibility of our approach, we performed an experimental evaluation using a dataset composed of 41 real-world phishing pages, along with their corresponding legitimate targets.

Scheduling problems are at the heart of any Grid-like computational system. Different types of scheduling based on different criteria, such as static versus dynamic environment, multi-objectivity, adaptivity, etc., are identified. Then, heuristic and meta-heuristic methods for scheduling in Grids are presented. The paper reveals the complexity of the scheduling problem in Computational Grids when compared to scheduling in classical parallel and distributed systems and shows the usefulness of heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches for the design of efficient Grid schedulers.

However, such dense networks can consume a significant amount of energy. In order to reduce the network's reliance on unsustainable energy sources, one can deploy self-powered SBSs that rely solely on energy harvesting. Due to the uncertainty of energy arrival and the finite capacity of energy storage systems, self-powered SBSs must smartly schedule their ON and OFF operation. In this paper, the problem of ON/OFF scheduling of self-powered SBSs is studied in the presence of energy harvesting uncertainty with the goal of minimizing the tradeoff between power consumption and flow-level delay. To solve this problem, a novel approach based on the ski rental framework, a powerful online optimization tool, is proposed. To find the desired solution of the ski rental problem, a randomized online algorithm is developed to enable each SBS to autonomously decide on its ON/OFF schedule, without knowing any prior information on future energy arrivals. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce power consumption and delay over a given time period compared to a baseline that turns SBSs ON by using an energy threshold. The results show that this performance gain can reach up to 12.7% reduction of the total cost. The results also show that the proposed algorithm can eliminate up to 72.5% of the ON/OFF switching overhead compared to the baseline approach.\nTitle:\nOnline Ski Rental For Scheduling Self-Powered, Energy Harvesting Small Base Stations\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We motivate the usefulness and expressiveness of combining several learning tools into one integrated learning experience.

An execution of a broadcasting protocol is a series of events, each of which consists of simultaneous transmitting or delivering of messages. The aim is to transmit the source message to all nodes of the network. If two messages are delivered simultaneously to a node, a collision occurs and this node does not hear anything. An asynchronous adversary may delay message deliveries, so as to create unwanted collisions and interfere with message dissemination. The total number of message transmissions executed by a protocol in the worst case is called the work of the protocol, and is used as the measure of its complexity. The aim of this paper is to study how various types of information available to nodes influence the optimal work of an asynchronous broadcasting protocol. This information may concern past events possibly affecting the behavior of nodes (adaptive vs. oblivious protocols), or may concern the topology of the network or some of its parameters. We show that decreasing the knowledge available to nodes may cause exponential increase of work of an asynchronous broadcasting protocol, and in some cases may even make broadcasting impossible.\nTitle:\nImpact of Information on the Complexity of Asynchronous Radio Broadcasting\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This fact stimulates the research work in the field of Java program verification in order to consolidate both Java safety and security. The results achieved so far in this sector axe very promising and effective. Nevertheless, the current Java security architecture still suffers from some weaknesses in terms of flexibility, efficiency and robustness. We therefore propose an architecture, named Java Certifying Compilation (JACC) system, for secure compilation and execution of Java mobile code. This architecture is based on a synergy between certifying compilation and formal automatic verification h la model-checking. Indeed, we have extended the certifying compilation and model-checking approaches to enforce high-level security policies in Java. In this paper, we present our work in designing and implementing the JACC system, which includes a certifying compiler, a security policy specification language and an extended bytecode verifier that integrates a model-checker. This system is flexible, efficient and robust and can be used to enforce both the safety and the security of Java programs.\nTitle:\nSecure Self-certified Code for Java\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

What does the underworld of fraudulent reviewing look like? Detecting suspicious reviews has become a major issue for many online services. We propose the use of a clique-finding approach to discover well-organized suspicious reviewers. From a Yelp dataset with over one million reviews, we construct multiple Reviewer Similarity graphs to link users that have unusually similar behavior: two reviewers are connected in the graph if they have reviewed the same set of venues within a few days. From these graphs, our algorithms extracted many large cliques and quasi-cliques, the largest one containing a striking 11 users who coordinated their review activities in identical ways. Among the detected cliques, a large portion contain Yelp Scouts who are paid by Yelp to review venues in new areas.

In this context, little attention has been paid so far to coordination in software testing. In distributed development environments, testing is often performed by specialized teams that operate as independent quality assurance centers. The use of these centers can be advantageous from both an economic and a software quality perspective. These benefits, however, are offset by severe difficulties in coordination between testing and software development centers. Test centers operate as isolated silos and have little to no interactions with developers, which can result in multiple problems that lead to poor quality of software. Based on our preliminary investigation, we claim that we need to rethink the way testing is performed in distributed development environments. We then present a possible research agenda that would help address the identified issues and discuss the main challenges involved.\nTitle:\nBridging gaps between developers and testers in globally-distributed software development\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It is based on the analysis of latent topics embedded in comments and identifiers in source code. The measure, named as maximal weighted entropy, utilizes the latent Dirichlet allocation technique and information entropy measures to quantitatively evaluate the cohesion of classes in software. This paper presents the principles and the technology that stand behind the proposed measure. Two case studies on a large open source software system are presented. They compare the new measure with an extensive set of existing metrics and use them to construct models that predict software faults. The case studies indicate that the novel measure captures different aspects of class cohesion compared to the existing cohesion measures and improves fault prediction for most metrics, which are combined with maximal weighted entropy.\nTitle:\nModeling class cohesion as mixtures of latent topics\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In the data association part, the task is to assign a topic (a class) to each data point, and the intensity tracking part models the bursts and changes in intensities of topics over time. Our approach to this problem combines an extension of Factorial Hidden Markov models for topic intensity tracking with exponential order statistics for implicit data association. Experiments on text and email datasets show that the interplay of classification and topic intensity tracking improves the accuracy of both classification and intensity tracking. Even a little noise in topic assignments can mislead the traditional algorithms. However, our approach detects correct topic intensities even with 30% topic noise.\nTitle:\nData association for topic intensity tracking\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The factorial size of the space of rankings, however, typically forces one to make structural assumptions, such as smoothness, sparsity, or probabilistic independence about these underlying distributions. We approach the modeling problem from the computational principle that one should make structural assumptions which allow for efficient calculation of typical probabilistic queries. For ranking models, \"typical\" queries predominantly take the form of partial ranking queries (e.g., given a user's top-k favorite movies, what are his preferences over remaining movies?). In this paper, we argue that riffled independence factorizations proposed in recent literature [7, 8] are a natural structural assumption for ranking distributions, allowing for particularly efficient processing of partial ranking queries. \nTitle:\nEfficient Probabilistic Inference with Partial Ranking Queries\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In such systems, the secondary radio and processor operates with sufficiently low power that it may remain always vigilant, while the the main processor and primary, high-bandwidth radio remain off until triggered by the application. By exploiting the high energy efficiency of the main processor and primary radio along with proper usage, net operating energy benefits are enabled for applications. The secondary radio provides a constantly available multi-hop network, while paths in the primary network exist only when required. This paper describes a topology control mechanism for establishing an end-to-end path in a network of dual-radio nodes using the secondary radios as a control channel to selectively wake up nodes along the required end-to-end path. Using numerical models as well as testbed experimentation, we show that our proposed mechanism provides significant energy savings of more than 60% compared to alternative approaches, and that it incurs only moderately greater application latency.\nTitle:\nEnd-to-End Routing for Dual-Radio Sensor Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Within the last years, these measures have been extended and reused to measure semantic similarity; i.e., for comparing meanings rather than syntactic differences. Various measures for spatial applications have been developed, but a solid foundation for answering what they measure; how they are best applied in information retrieval; which role contextual information plays; and how similarity values or rankings should be interpreted is still missing. It is therefore difficult to decide which measure should be used for a particular application or to compare results from different similarity theories. Based on a review of existing similarity measures, we introduce a framework to specify the semantics of similarity. We discuss similarity-based information retrieval paradigms as well as their implementation in web-based user interfaces for geographic information retrieval to demonstrate the applicability of the framework. Finally, we formulate open challenges for similarity research.\nTitle:\nThe Semantics Of Similarity In Geographic Information Retrieval\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Healthcare expenses are dramatically rising due to growing elderly population. Many current technologies for gait analysis are laboratory-based and can incur substantial costs for the healthcare sector for treatment of falls. However utilization of alternative commercially available technologies can potentially reduce costs. Accelerometers are one such option, being ambulatory motion sensors for the detection of orientation and movement. Smart mobile devices are considered as non-invasive and increasingly contain accelerometers for detecting device orientation. This study looks at the capabilities of the accelerometer within a smart mobile device, namely the iPhone, for identification of gait events from walking along a flat surface.

Consequently, innovative methods that help determine the linkage between the rogue programs and adversaries are imperative for mitigating and combating botnet attacks. Recent study discovers that rogue programs are sold in black markets in online social networks and adversaries use online social networks to coordinate attacks. Correlation of botnet attacks and activities in online underground social networks is crucial to tactically cope with net-centric threats. In this paper, we take the first step toward adversarial behavior identification by modeling social dynamics of underground adversarial communities and tracing the origin of certain malwares and attack events in underground communities.

It decomposes a multi-objective problem into subproblems by mathematic programming methods and applies evolutionary algorithms to optimize the subproblems simultaneously. MOEA/D is good at finding Pareto solutions which are evenly distributed. However, it can be improved for problems with discontinuous Pareto fronts (PF). Many solutions will assemble in breakpoints in this situation. A method for adjusting weight vectors for bi-objective optimization problems with discontinuous PF is proposed. Firstly, this method detects the weight vectors which need to be adjusted using a property of MOEA/D. Secondly, the reserved vectors are divided into several subsets. Thirdly, after calculating the ideal number of vectors in each subset, vectors are adjusted evenly. Lastly, the corresponding solutions are updated by a linear interpolation. Numerical experiment shows the proposed method obtains good diversity and convergence on approached PF.\nTitle:\nAdjust weight vectors in MOEA/D for bi-objective optimization problems with discontinuous Pareto fronts.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The algorithm, named CLUBS+ (for CLustering Using Binary Splitting), achieves these results by combining features of hierarchical and partition-based algorithms. Thus, CLUBS+ consists of two major phases, i.e., a divisive phase and an agglomerative phase, each followed by a refinement phase. Each major phase consists of successive steps in which the samples are repartitioned using a criterion based on least quadratic distance. This criterion possesses unique analytical properties that are elucidated in the paper and exploited by the algorithm to achieve a very fast computation. The paper presents the results of the extensive experiments performed: these confirm that the new algorithm is fast, impervious to noise, and produces results of better quality than other algorithms, such as BOOL, BIRCH, and k-means++, even when the analyst can determine the correct number of clustersa very difficult task from which users are spared by CLUBS+.\nTitle:\nA fast and accurate algorithm for unsupervised clustering around centroids.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Traditionally, an oceanographic research vessel is used to monitor marine environments, which is very expensive and time-consuming and has a low resolution both in time and space. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have recently been considered as a promising solution for this purpose since they have a number of advantages such as easy deployment, unmanned operation, real-time monitoring, and relatively low cost. This paper first describes a common architecture of WSN-based oceanographic monitoring systems and a general architecture of an oceanographic sensor node. Then, it presents a detailed review of some related projects, systems, and technologies. It also highlights major challenges and research opportunities on the development and deployment of wireless sensor networks for marine environment monitoring.\nTitle:\nMarine environment monitoring using Wireless Sensor Networks: A systematic review\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, intermediaries may also connect these principals with other professionals who can provide assistance with and support for the transaction. We address the question of which set of ties\u2014to buyers and sellers or to other professionals\u2014are more important to the success of market intermediaries, using data from the U.S. residential real estate industry. From a national survey of 525 real estate agents, we find that ties to other professionals are more important than ties to buyers and sellers as predictors of the market intermediary's income, counter to the general wisdom about real estate in particular and market intermediaries more generally. We suggest that the professional networks around market intermediaries may behave like \u201cquasi-firms\u201d helping buyers and sellers navigate complex market transactions.\nTitle:\nSocial Networks and the Success of Market Intermediaries: Evidence From the U.S. Residential Real Estate Industry\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It studies the transmission of information in a geometric space, where information flows can be routed along any trajectories, and can be encoded wherever they meet. The goal is to satisfy given end-to-end unicast/multicast throughput demands, while minimizing a natural bandwidth-distance sum-product (network volume). Space information flow models the design of a blueprint for a minimum-cost network. We study the multicast version of the space information flow problem, in Euclidean spaces. We present a simple example that demonstrates the design of an information network is indeed different from that of a transportation network. We discuss properties of optimal multicast network embedding, prove that network coding does not make a difference in the basic case of 1-to-2 multicast, and prove upper-bounds on the number of relay nodes required in an optimal acyclic multicast network.\nTitle:\nMin-cost multicast networks in Euclidean space\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In order to improve the performance of the multi-route coding, a route selection scheme is very important issue. In this paper, we propose the route selection scheme for the multi-route coding in multihop cellular networks. The proposed scheme is based on the bit error rate of wireless links.

Many media fa\u00e7ades cover most of the outer shell of a building and come with a 3D form factor. They offer great potential for remote interaction in which the interactive area goes beyond the parts of the fa\u00e7ade that are visible from the user's current perspective. Common interaction techniques often focus on a fixed part of the media fa\u00e7ade. This restricts exploiting the full capabilities and the potential of such gigantic screens. In this paper we describe how to apply cartographic map projections to create 2D map representations of media fa\u00e7ades to address this problem. We describe how a continuous interaction with the media fa\u00e7ade is possible, independent of the form factor. We analyze existing media fa\u00e7ades and provide a set of guidelines for how to create fa\u00e7ade maps for different form factors.\nTitle:\nFa\u00e7ade map: continuous interaction with media fa\u00e7ades using cartographic map projections\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Particularly, different kinds of level set-based methods which are improvements of the traditional active contours are analyzed. In order to circumvent the initialization problem of active contours, we separate the segmentation process into two stages. For the first stage, we introduce an approach which approximately locates the indentations with a high certainty. The results achieved with this method serve as initializations for the precise active contours (second stage). This two-stage approach delivers highly precise results for most real world indentation images. However, there are images, which are very difficult to segment. To handle even such images, our segmentation method is incorporated with the Shape from Focus approach, by including 3D information. In order to decrease the overall runtime, moreover, a gradual enhancement approach based on unfocused images is introduced. With three different databases, we compare the proposed methods and we show that the segmentation accuracy of these methods is highly competitive compared with other approaches in the literature.\nTitle:\nActive contours methods with respect to Vickers indentations.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Specifically, we aim at studying whether we could improve the pace of short data request, such as HTTP request, by giving a high priority to that are not previously enqueued inside a core router.Following the idea that long-lived TCP flows greatly increase the routing queue delay, the motivation of this work is to minimise the impact in terms of delay, introduced by long-lived TCP flows over shot TCP flows. Thus, this forwarding scheme avoids to delay packets that do not belong to a flow already enqueued inside a router in order to avoid delay penalty to short flow.

In this article we present a new technique called forced inheritance for providing orthogonal persistence to C++. This method achieves both orthogonal persistence and portability, which could not be provided at the same time by previous methods. In this technique, properties that make objects persist are attached as a header to an object or a value of any type that should persist. Attaching the header gives the effect of inheriting these properties from a virtual persistent root class regardless of its type. This technique provides orthogonal persistence because any object can have a header attached to it. It also provides portability because it does not extend the language. Finally, we have developed an object-oriented database system prototype using forced inheritance and proved the feasibility and effectiveness of the method.\nTitle:\nForced Inheritance: A New Approach for Providing Orthogonal Persistence to C\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, adversaries may be involved in potential relationships, the trustworthiness of the relationships must be ensured. Thus, the disclosure of private information must be well controlled, and users have to be authenticated. In this paper, we propose a revocable authenticated key agreement system (RAKA), which does not require intensive computation for authentication in MSNs. RAKA not only provides a simple rekeying process but also aggregates multiple successive private key update operations into a single rekeying process. The proposed revocation method incurs low communication overhead on mobile devices using a single message broadcast. RAKA is proved to be resilient against malicious attacks.\nTitle:\nRAKA: Revocable Authenticated Key Agreement System for Mobile Social Networks.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Here serving area stands for the geographical distribution of online users who are interested in a given web site. In this paper, we proposed a set of novel methods to detect the serving area of web resources by analyzing search engine logs. We use the search logs to detect serving area in two ways. First, we extracted the user IP locations to generate the geographical distribution of users who had the same interests in a web site. Second, query terms input by users were considered as the user knowledge about a web site. To increase the confidence and to cover new sites for use in real-time applications, we also proposed a categorization system for local web sites. A novel method for detecting the serving area was proposed based on categorizing the web content. For each category, a radius was assigned according to previous logs. In our experiments, we evaluated all these three algorithms. From the results, we found that the approach based on query terms was superior to that based on IP locations, since search queries for local sites tended to include location words while the IP locations were sometimes erroneous. The approach based on categorization was efficient for sites of known categories and were useful for small sites without sufficient number of query logs.\nTitle:\nComputing geographical serving area based on search logs and website categorization\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A key aspect of this study is the modeling of a fair-access criterion that requires sensors to have an equal rate of underwater frame delivery to the base station. Tight upper bounds on network utilization and tight lower bounds on the minimum time between samples are derived for fixed linear and grid topologies. The significance of these bounds is two-fold: First, they hold for any MAC protocol under both single-channel and half-duplex radios; second, they are provably tight. For underwater sensor networks, under certain conditions, we derive a tight upper bound on network utilization and demonstrate a significant fact that the utilization in networks with propagation delay is larger than that in networks with no propagation delay. The challenge of this work about underwater sensor networks lies in the fact that the propagation delay impact on underwater sensor networks is difficult to model. Finally, we explore bounds in networks with more complex topologies.\nTitle:\nTight Performance Bounds of Multihop Fair Access for MAC Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks and Underwater Sensor Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Traditional navigation systems sample the phone's GPS at a fixed rate (usually around 1Hz), regardless of factors such as current vehicle speed and distance from the next navigation waypoint. This practice results in a large energy consumption and unnecessarily reduces the attainable length of a navigation session, if the phone is left unplugged. The paper investigates two questions. First, would drivers be willing to sacrifice some of the affordances of modern navigation systems in order to prolong battery life? Second, how much energy could be saved using straightforward alternative localization mechanisms, applied to complement GPS for vehicular navigation? According to a survey we conducted of 500 drivers, as much as 91% of drivers said they would like to have a vehicular navigation application with an energy saving mode. To meet this need, eNav exploits on-board accelerometers for approximate location sensing when the vehicle is sufficiently far from the next navigation waypoint (or is stopped). A user test-study of eNav shows that it results in roughly the same user experience as standard GPS navigation systems, while reducing navigation energy consumption by almost 80%. We conclude that drivers find an energy-saving mode on phone-based vehicular navigation applications desirable, even at the expense of some loss of functionality, and that significant savings can be achieved using straightforward location sensing mechanisms that avoid frequent GPS sampling.\nTitle:\nExperiences with eNav: a low-power vehicular navigation system\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Designing clustering protocols that are heterogeneity aware is still an open issue in sensor networks. This work focuses on hierarchically clustered heterogeneous sensor networks. Sensor nodes organize themselves in self organized groups called clusters. Each cluster consists of a cluster head and some member nodes. The sensor network consists of nodes of two different energy levels. We show that current heterogeneity aware protocols (such as SEP [1], DEEC [2] etc.) are unable to distribute the usage of energy amongst the sensor nodes uniformly. We propose CRP, Cluster Re-election Protocol, that is heterogeneity aware and enhances the network stability period (period before which the first node dies) over current protocols. We show, by simulation, that CRP improves network stability by reducing the variation in the residual energy of sensor nodes. Therefore. CRP is able to exploit the heterogeneity present in a sensor network in an efficient manner.\nTitle:\nCRP: Cluster head Re-election Protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Micro-quadrocopters are extremely noisy, have low CPU power and cannot lift heavy equipment: the small payload of each micro-quadrocopter ( g) only allows us to equip it with one microphone in addition to the inbuilt motion sensors. To perform robust SSL despite these issues, we propose three functions: (1) Self-localization of the quadrocopters using sound landmarks placed in the environment, and simultaneous localization of unknown sound sources; (2) Sound source detection; (3) Distributed data fusion based on noisy information from all members of the swarm. To achieve these, we propose three algorithms that are robust to noise, can perform with a varying number of quadrocopters, and do not rely on GPS nor motion capture to allow indoor operations: (1) A sound-based Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for self-localization of each quadrocopter; (2) A peak-based algorithm for sound source detection; (3) A distributed SSL algorithm for swarms with consensus-based integration using a new filter termed Unscented Kalman Consensus Filter (UKCF). We evaluated the proposed methods in real world and in simulated environments. The preliminary results show that the sound-based UKF represents an improvement of 37% on position estimation precision compared to basic dead reckoning approaches, even when the theoretical assumptions are violated; the distributed UKCF gives an improvement of 85% on SSL compared to a single-sensor approach in simulation.\nTitle:\nSwarm of micro-quadrocopters for consensus-based sound source localization.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this setting, standard classification methods, with complexity linear in the number of classes, become intractable, while enforcing structural constraints among classes (such as low-rank or tree-structure) to reduce complexity often sacrifices accuracy for efficiency. The recent PD-Sparse method addresses this via an algorithm that is sub-linear in the number of variables, by exploiting primal-dual sparsity inherent in a specific loss function, namely the max-margin loss. In this work, we extend PD-Sparse to be efficiently parallelized in large-scale distributed settings. By introducing separable loss functions, we can scale out the training, with network communication and space efficiency comparable to those in one-versus-all approaches while maintaining an overall complexity sub-linear in the number of classes. On several large-scale benchmarks our proposed method achieves accuracy competitive to the state-of-the-art while reducing the training time from days to tens of minutes compared with existing parallel or sparse methods on a cluster of 100 cores.\n\n\nTitle:\nPPDsparse: A Parallel Primal-Dual Sparse Method for Extreme Classification.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In EnaCloud, we use a Virtual Machine to encapsulate the application, which supports applications scheduling and live migration to minimize the number of running machines, so as to save energy. Specially, the application placement is abstracted as a bin packing problem, and an energy-aware heuristic algorithm is proposed to get an appropriate solution. In addition, an over-provision approach is presented to deal with the varying resource demands of applications.

In this context, conventional routing schemes would fail. To deal with such networks we propose the use of an opportunistic hop-by-hop routing model. According to the model, a series of independent, local forwarding decisions are made, based on current connectivity and predictions of future connectivity information diffused through nodes' mobility. The important issue here is how to choose an appropriate next hop. To this end, we propose and analyze via theory and simulations a number of routing algorithms. The champion algorithm turns out to be one that combines the simplicity of a simple random policy, which is efficient in finding good leads towards the destination, with the sophistication of utility-based policies that efficiently follow good leads. We also state and analyze the performance of an oracle-based optimal algorithm, and compare it to the online approaches. The metrics used in the comparison are the average message delivery delay and the number of transmissions per message delivered. I.

Many of these techniques rely on similarity measures to identify structurally equivalent code, however, up until now the effect of this similarity measure on the performance of the refactoring identification algorithm is largely unexplored. In this paper we replicate a well-known experiment from Wei\u00dfgerber and Diehl, plugging in three different similarity measures (text-based, AST-based, token-based). We look at the overlap of the results obtained by the different metrics, and we compare the results using recall and the computation time.

Hierarchical Bayesian models are used to connect three elements in visual surveillance: low-level visual features, simple \"atomic\" activities, and interactions. Atomic activities are modeled as distributions over low-level visual features, and multi-agent interactions are modeled as distributions over atomic activities. These models are learnt in an unsupervised way. Given a long video sequence, moving pixels are clustered into different atomic activities and short video clips are clustered into different interactions. In this paper, we propose three hierarchical Bayesian models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) mixture model, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) mixture model, and Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (Dual-HDP) model. They advance existing language models, such as LDA [1] and HDP [2]. Our data sets are challenging video sequences from crowded traffic scenes and train station scenes with many kinds of activities co-occurring. Without tracking and human labeling effort, our framework completes many challenging visual surveillance tasks of board interest such as: (1) discovering typical atomic activities and interactions; (2) segmenting long video sequences into different interactions; (3) segmenting motions into different activities; (4) detecting abnormality; and (5) supporting high-level queries on activities and interactions.\nTitle:\nUnsupervised activity perception in crowded and complicated scenes using hierarchical bayesian models.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To make the data from image and text modalities comparable, previous cross-modal retrieval methods directly learn two projection matrices to map the raw features of the two modalities into a common subspace, in which cross-modal data matching can be performed. However, the different feature representations and correlation structures of different modalities inhibit these methods from efficiently modeling the relationships across modalities through a common subspace. To handle the diversities of different modalities, we first leverage the coupled dictionary learning method to generate homogeneous sparse representations for different modalities by associating and jointly updating their dictionaries. We then use a coupled feature mapping scheme to project the derived sparse representations from different modalities into a common subspace in which cross-modal retrieval can be performed. Experiments on a variety of cross-modal retrieval tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.\nTitle:\nCoupled dictionary learning and feature mapping for cross-modal retrieval\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In the following, the MCN term is specifically used to indicate the exploitation of cloud resources and infrastructures (possibly distributed and federated) to sustain and provision mobility-enabled services to mobile devices, with significant advantages in terms of both cost/investment reduction for mobile infrastructure providers and additional innovative (functional and non-functional) features generated by infrastructure virtualization. Let me note that this definition does not include other potential forms of \"mobile clouds\" that can combine the innovation directions of mobility and cloud, e.g., exploiting richer and richer mobile devices as cloud-like virtual resources, for instance in the so-called vehicular clouds [1]. The latter approaches are considered out of the scope of this paper and presentation.\nTitle:\nMobile Cloud Networking: Lessons Learnt, Open Research Directions, and Industrial Innovation Opportunities\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We argue that the computer vision techniques that have been successfully applied in those settings can effectively be translated to other domains, such as audio.

Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called \"perceptual losses\"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.\nTitle:\nThe Unreasonable Effectiveness of Deep Features as a Perceptual Metric\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our approach supports a wide range of commonly-used editing operations such as cropping, object insertion and removal, linear and non-linear color transformations, and spatially-varying adjustment brushes. Given an input image pair, we first apply a dense correspondence method between them to match edited image regions with their sources. For each edited region, we determine geometric and semantic appearance operations that have been applied. Finally, we compute an optimal editing path from the region-level editing operations, based on predefined semantic constraints. The recovered history can be used in various applications such as image re-editing, edit transfer, and image revision control. A user study suggests that the editing histories generated from our system are semantically comparable to the ones generated by artists.\nTitle:\nInverse image editing: recovering a semantic editing history from a before-and-after image pair\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In [4], we have addressed the issue of non-uniform error criteria in statistical pattern recognition, and generalized the Bayes decision theory for pattern recognition tasks where errors over different classes have varying degrees of significance. We further introduced the weighted minimum classification error (MCE) method for a practical design of a statistical pattern recognition system to achieve empirical optimality when non-uniform error criteria are prescribed. However, one key issue in the weighted MCE method, the methodology of building a suitable non-uniform error cost function given the user\u2019s requirements, has not been addressed yet. In this paper, we propose some viable techniques for the design of the non-uniform error cost function in the context of automatic speech recognition (ASR) according to different training scenarios.

Three major observations from our experiments on the EARTH multithreaded testbed are: (1) The scalability of our CG implementation is impressive, e.g., speedup is 90 on 120 processors for the NAS CG class B input. (2) Our dataflow-style reduction-broadcast network based on fine-grain multithreading is twice as fast as a serial reduction scheme on the same system.

Furthermore, the latent hidden layer features of different models are projected to formulate a shared space based on correlation learning. Then several different correlation learning schemes are evaluated against the proposed scheme. We evaluate the advocated approach on a popular face dataset-FRGCV2.0. Experimental results demonstrate that the latent features extracted using RBMs are effective in improving the performance of correlation mapping for 2D-3D face recognition.\nTitle:\n2D-3D face recognition via Restricted Boltzmann Machines\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In particular, the collection of methods known as 'data mining' offers methodological and technical solutions to deal with the analysis of medical data and construction of prediction models. A large variety of these methods requires general and simple guidelines that may help practitioners in the appropriate selection of data mining tools, construction and validation of predictive models, along with the dissemination of predictive models within clinical environments.The goal of this review is to discuss the extent and role of the research area of predictive data mining and to propose a framework to cope with the problems of constructing, assessing and exploiting data mining models in clinical medicine.We review the recent relevant work published in the area of predictive data mining in clinical medicine, highlighting critical issues and summarizing the approaches in a set of learned lessons.The paper provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art of predictive data mining in clinical medicine and gives guidelines to carry out data mining studies in this field.Predictive data mining is becoming an essential instrument for researchers and clinical practitioners in medicine. Understanding the main issues underlying these methods and the application of agreed and standardized procedures is mandatory for their deployment and the dissemination of results. Thanks to the integration of molecular and clinical data taking place within genomic medicine, the area has recently not only gained a fresh impulse but also a new set of complex problems it needs to address.\nTitle:\nPredictive data mining in clinical medicine: current issues and guidelines.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Several 3D position-based routing protocols were proposed to seek either delivery guarantee or energy-efficiency in 3D wireless networks. However, recent results [1,2] showed that there is no deterministic localized routing algorithm that guarantees either delivery of packets or energy-efficiency of its routes in 3D networks. In this paper, we focus on design of 3D greedy routing protocols which can guarantee delivery of packets and/or energy-efficiency of their paths with high probability in a randomly deployed 3D sensor network. In particular, we first study the asymptotic critical transmission radius for 3D greedy routing to ensure the packet delivery in large-scale random 3D sensor networks, then propose a refined 3D greedy routing protocol to achieve energy-efficiency of its paths with high probability. We also conduct extensive simulations to confirm our theoretical results.\nTitle:\nThree-dimensional greedy routing in large-scale random wireless sensor networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Among them, the most popular solutions are the Wi-Fi fingerprint-based approaches. The core challenge is to lower the cost of fingerprint site-survey. One of the trends is to collect the piecewise data from clients and establish the radio map in crowdsourcing manner. However the low participation rate blocks the practical use. In this work, we propose a passive crowdsourcing channel state information (CSI) based indoor localization scheme, C2IL. Despite a crowdsourcing based approach, our scheme is totally transparent to the client and the only requirement is to connect to our 802.11n access points (APs). C2IL is built upon an innovative method to accurately estimate the moving speed solely based on 802.11n CSI. Knowing the walking speed of a client and its surrounding APs, a graph matching algorithm is employed to extract the received signal strength (RSS) fingerprints and establish the fingerprint map. For localization phase, we design a trajectory clustering based localization algorithm to provide precise real-time indoor localization and tracking. We develop and deploy a practical working system of C2IL in a large office environment. Extensive evaluations indicate that the error of speed estimation is within 3%, and the localization error is within 2 m at 80% time in a very complex indoor environment.\nTitle:\nCommunicating Is Crowdsourcing: Wi-Fi Indoor Localization with CSI-Based Speed Estimation.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

While watching TV programs, viewers often search related information about the programs through the Web. Nevertheless, as TV programs keep playing, viewers possibly miss some important scenes when searching the Web. As a result, their enjoyment would be spoiled. Another problem is that there are various topics in each scene of a video, and viewers usually have different levels of knowledge. Thus, it is important to detect topics in videos and supplement videos with related information automatically. In this paper, the authors propose a novel automatic video reinforcing system with two functions: 1 a media synchronization mechanism, which presents supplementary information synchronized with videos, in order to enable viewers to effectively understand the geographic data in videos; 2 a video reconstruction mechanism, which generates new video contents based on viewers' interests and knowledge by adding and removing scenes, in order to enable viewers to enjoy the generated videos without additional search.\nTitle:\nAn Automatic Video Reinforcing System for TV Programs using Semantic Metadata from Closed Captions\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

High-level parallel programs are translated by a single optimizing compiler to a fine-grained abstract parallel machine, TAM. A final compilation step is unique to each machine and optimizes for specifics of the architecture. By determining the cost of the primitives and weighting them by their dynamic frequency in parallel programs, we quantify the effectiveness of the following mechanisms individually and in combination. Efficient processor/network coupling proves valuable. Message dispatch is found to be less valuable without atomic operations that allow the scheduling levels to cooperate. Multiple hardware contexts are of small value when the contexts cooperate and the compiler can partition the register set. Tagged memory provides little gain. Finally, the performance of the overall system is strongly influenced by the performance of the memory system and the frequency of control operations.\nTitle:\nEvaluation of mechanisms for fine-grained parallel programs in the J-machine and the CM-5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The proposed approach is designed in order to guarantee the watermark imperceptibility both in the HDR marked image and in its Low Dynamic Range (LDR) counterpart, being thus robust against significant non-linear distortions such as those performed by tone-mapping operators (TMOs). In order to do so, the wavelet transform of the Just Noticeable Difference (JND)-scaled space of the original HDR image is employed as embedding domain Moreover, a visual mask taking into account specific aspects of the Human Visual System (HVS) is exploited to improve the quality of the resulting watermarked image. Specifically, bilateral filtering is used to locate information on the detail part of the HDR image, where the watermark should be preferably embedded. A contrast sensitivity function is also employed to modulate the watermark intensity in each wavelet decomposition subband according to its scale and orientation. An extensive set of experimental results testifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in embedding multi-bit watermarks into HDR images without affecting the visual quality of the original image, while being robust against TMOs.\nTitle:\nHdr Image Multi-Bit Watermarking Using Bilateral-Filtering-Based Masking\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Especially, in search evaluation studies, time is usually adopted as a measure to quantify users' efforts in search processes. Psychological studies have reported that the time perception of human beings can be affected by many stimuli, such as attention and motivation, which are closely related to many cognitive factors in search. Considering the fact that users' search experiences are affected by their subjective feelings of time, rather than the objective time measured by timing devices, it is necessary to look into the different factors that have impacts on search users' perception of time. In this work, we make a first step towards revealing the time perception mechanism of search users with the following contributions: (1) We establish an experimental research framework to measure the subjective perception of time while reading documents in search scenario, which originates from but is also different from traditional time perception measurements in psychological studies. (2) With the framework, we show that while users are reading result documents, document relevance has small yet visible effect on search users' perception of time. By further examining the impact of other factors, we demonstrate that the effect on relevant documents can also be influenced by individuals and tasks. (3) We conduct a preliminary experiment in which the difference between perceived time and dwell time is taken into consideration in a search evaluation task. We found that the revised framework achieved a better correlation with users' satisfaction feedbacks. This work may help us better understand the time perception mechanism of search users and provide insights in how to better incorporate time factor in search evaluation studies.\nTitle:\nDoes Document Relevance Affect the Searcher's Perception of Time?\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

An analytical model has been proposed to understand the restoration probability behavior of a connection request in optical networks employing AR based on the assumption that all the backup routes of the connection are independent. In a real AR-based optical network, however, the backup paths of a connection are likely correlated since they may share some common links along their routes. As the first step toward the restoration probability analysis incorporating the correlation among backup paths of a connection in AR-based networks, we propose in this paper an analytical approach to modeling the restoration probability of the connection by considering all the possible correlation between any two of its successive backup paths. Compared to the old restoration models without considering the correlation among backup paths, the proposed new model can significantly improve the accuracy in estimating the restoration probability for AR-based networks, as verified by extensive simulation results based on two typical backbone network topologies.\nTitle:\nPerformance Analysis for Active Restoration-Based Optical Networks Incorporating the Correlation Among Backup Routes.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Safe resets are possible in the presence of certain faults, such as process fail-stops and repairs, but are not always possible in the presence of more general faults, such as arbitrary transients. In this paper, we design a bounded-memory distributed-reset program that possesses two tolerances: (1) in the presence of fail-stops and repairs, it always executes resets safely, and (2) in the presence of a finite number of transient faults, it eventually executes resets safely. Designing this multitolerance in the reset program introduces the novel concern of designing a safety detector that is itself multitolerant. A broad application of our multitolerant safety detector is to make any total program likewise multitolerant.\nTitle:\nMultitolerance in Distributed Reset\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The web site comparison is useful for extracting patterns which can be used for improving Web search engine effectiveness, the identification of best practices in web site design and of course in the organization of web page content to personalize the web user experience on a web site. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was tested in a real world case, with e-shop web sites showing that a web site can be represented in a high level of abstraction by using MicroGenres, the contents of which can then be compared and given a measure corresponding to web site similarity. This measure is very useful for detecting web communities on the Web, i.e., a group of web sites sharing similar contents, and the result is essential in performing a focused and effective information search as well as minimizing web page retrieval.\nTitle:\nA novel approach for comparing web sites by using MicroGenres\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For example, why is the ability to perfectly observe time assumed implicitly in virtually all control formulations? What happens if this implicit assumption is violated? It turns out that some basic control results fall apart when time cannot be perfectly measured. To make this explicit, we introduce information space concepts that permit imperfect time information to be considered in the same way as imperfect state information. We then argue that classical open-loop control should be reconsidered as perfect time-feedback control. Following this, we introduce a notion of strongly open-loop control, which does not require perfect time observations. We provide some examples of these concepts and argue that many fascinating directions for future controls research emerge.\nTitle:\nOn Time: Clocks, Chronometers, And Open-Loop Control\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We describe an algorithm pipeline that (1) identifies the overall geometry of the input, (2) computes a crease pattern that causes the sheet to self-fold into the desired 3D geometry when activated by uniform heating, (3) automatically generates the design of a 2D sheet with the desired pattern and (4) automatically generates the design files required to fabricate the 2D structure. We demonstrate these algorithms by applying them to complex 3D shapes.

A major contribution of the paper is to develop for the first time a class of (inexact) best-response-like algorithms with provable convergence, where a suitably convexified version of the original DC program is iteratively solved. The main feature of the proposed successive convex approximation method is its decomposability structure across the users, which leads naturally to distributed algorithms in the primal and/or dual domain. The proposed framework is applicable to a variety of multiuser DC problems in different areas, ranging from signal processing, to communications and networking. As a case study, in the second part of the paper we focus on two examples, namely: i) a novel resource allocation problem in the emerging area of cooperative physical layer security and ii) and the renowned sum-rate maximization of MIMO Cognitive Radio networks. Our contribution in this context is to devise a class of easy-to-implement distributed algorithms with provable convergence to stationary solution of such problems.

The proposed control scheme integrates hybrid position/force control and vibration suppression control. To derive the control scheme, kinematics and dynamics of the robot when it forms a closed kinematic chain is discussed. Kinematics is described using workspace force, velocity and position vectors, and hybrid position/force control is extended from that on dual-rigid-arm robots. Dynamics is derived from constraint conditions and the lumped-mass-spring model of the flexible robots and an object. The vibration suppression control is calculated from the deflections of the flexible links and the dynamics. Experiments on cooperative control are performed. The absolute positions/orientations and internal forces/moments are controlled using the robot, each arm of which has two flexible links, seven joints and a force/torque sensor. The results illustrate that the robot handled the rigid object damping links' vibration successfully in three-dimensional space.\nTitle:\nCooperative Control of a 3D Dual-Flexible-Arm Robot\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Existing ocean studies using independent mobile sensors have led to many interesting discoveries. Therefore, the networking capability will extend the capability of existing approaches and enable novel applications because it provides more control and coordination of the sensors. However, network mobility and environment uncertainty create numerous challenging issues which need to be addressed before such a paradigm becomes reality. Network deployment is among the most important problems because it has a significant impact on other research areas. In this paper, we consider the reuse-based deployment scheme in which a mobile underwater sensor network operates in a bounded area and a sensor, when reaching beyond the area, is deployed back into it. We propose a deployment framework to study the connectivity and coverage of such networks and show its effectiveness through two case studies. Our framework is based on the idea that the reuse of network nodes stabilizes these network metrics. By modeling them, we can estimate the number of nodes needed to achieve a requirement on network coverage or network connectivity only by solving algebraic equations rather than running more simulations.\nTitle:\nDeployment framework for mobile underwater wireless networks with node reuse.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Interfaces implementing these techniques were used by 40 subjects to perform a task that involved navigating a large hierarchical tree dataset and making topological comparisons between nodes in the tree. Our results show that Pan and Zoom Navigation was significantly faster and required less mental effort than Rubber Sheet Navigation, independent of the presence or absence of an overview. Also, overviews did not appear to improve performance, but were still perceived as beneficial by users.

Since Internet address allocation and policy information is distributed across many devices, applications, and administrative domains, constructing a comprehensive map of unused and unreachable (\"dark\") addresses is challenging. In this paper, we present an architecture that automates the process of discovering these dark addresses by actively participating with allocation, routing, and policy systems. Our approach is to adopt a local perspective revealing unreachable external addresses and unused private and local addresses, and enabling the detection of threats coming into and out of a network. To validate the approach, we construct a prototype system called the Dark Oracle that uses internal and external routing data and host configuration information, such as DHCP logs, to automatically discover dark addresses. We experimentally evaluate the prototype using data from a large enterprise network, and a regional ISP, and from deployment of the Dark Oracle on a large academic network.\nTitle:\nThe dark oracle: perspective-aware unused and unreachable address discovery\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This standard is able to outperform prior standards by up to 50% in terms of perceptual video quality, but at the cost of extremely large computational complexities. For this reason, the development of fast coding algorithms is now a requirement to make HEVC an adequate candidate for real-world scenarios. In this regard, this paper proposes a collaborative CPU \\(+\\) GPU coding architecture for this standard, in which the CPU performs a coarse-grained parallelization of the encoder, while the GPU carries out a fast motion estimation. Given that the GPU algorithm can work together with a wide variety of parallel algorithms, this paper evaluates two of them: tiles, defined in the standard, and slices, already present in previous standards. Results indicate that slices are more adequate in terms of parallel efficiency (10.75\\(\\times {}\\) speedup on average using 12 threads), while tiles achieve better coding efficiency.\nTitle:\nHeterogeneous CPU plus GPU approaches for HEVC\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, the new High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard has recently been developed and it is thought that it will dominate the market in the next few years. These two facts make an efficient transcoding system between H.264/AVC and HEVC necessary. Moreover, it should be taken into account that intra sequences are commonly used in certain scenarios, such as video editing and post-production, making a migration of these intra contents from H.264/AVC to HEVC necessary. This paper proposes a fast intra H.264/AVC to HEVC transcoding system that is based on Bayesian classifiers and which outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving a good complexity reduction with a negligible bit rate increase.\nTitle:\nA fast intra H.264/AVC to HEVC transcoding system.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

They are elementary pieces of information describing combinations of concepts. We use star-graphs as descriptors - or index terms - for image content representation. This allows for relational indexing and expression of complex user needs, in comparison to classical text retrieval, where simple keywords are generally used as document descriptors. In classical text retrieval, the keywords are weighted to give emphasis to good document descriptors and discriminators where the most popular weighting schemes are based on variations of tf.idf. In this paper, we present an extension of tf.idf, introducing a new weighting scheme suited for star-graphs. This weighting scheme is based on a local analysis of star-graphs indexing a document and a global analysis of star-graphs across the whole collection.

The main innovation is a new key exchange message constructed in a manner that ensures an adversary can neither hide the fact that a message was transmitted, nor alter its payload without being detected. Thus, any attempt by an adversary to interfere with the key exchange translates into the pairing devices detecting either invalid pairing messages or an unacceptable increase in the number of such messages. We analytically prove that our design is secure against MITM attacks, and show that our protocol is practical by implementing a prototype using off-the-shelf 802.11 cards. An evaluation of our protocol on two busy wireless networks (MIT's campus network and a reproduction of the SIGCOMM 2010 network using traces) shows that it can effectively implement key exchange in a real-world environment.\nTitle:\nSecure in-band wireless pairing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Such a large-scale biometric system needs to consider template protection, accuracy and efficiency issues. This is a challenging problem since there are tradeoffs among these three issues. In order to simultaneously handle these issues, we extract both global and local features via controlling the sparsity of random bases without training. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused with a sequential classifier. In the proposed system, the random basis features are not stored for security reason. The non-training based on feature extraction followed by a sequential learning contributes to computational efficiency. The overall accuracy is consequently improved via an ensemble of classifiers. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system using equal error rate under a stolen-token scenario. Our experimental results show that the proposed method is robust over severe local deformation with efficient computation for simultaneous transactions.

Our system combines numerous sources of information (genomic sequences, expressed sequence tags and protein databases of related species) into a gene finder based on a hidden Markov model in a novel and systematic way. In our framework, various sources of information are expressed as partial probabilistic statements about positions in the sequence and their annotation. We then combine these into the final prediction via a quadratic programming method, which we show to be an extension of existing methods. Allowing only partial statements is key to our transparent handling of missing information and coping with the heterogeneous character of individual sources of information. In addition, we give a new method for modeling the length distribution of intergenic regions in hidden Markov models.On a commonly used test set, ExonHunter performs significantly better than the existing gene finders ROSETTA, SLAM and TWINSCAN, with more than two-thirds of genes predicted completely correctly.Supplementary material available at http://www.bioinformatics.uwaterloo.ca/supplements/05eh/\nTitle:\nExonHunter: a comprehensive approach to gene finding.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Most tangible devices for tabletops use infrared to send information about their position, orientation, and state. The method we propose can be realized as a tabletop system using a low-cost camera to detect position and a low-cost infrared (IR) receiver to detect the state of each device. Since two different receivers (camera and IR-receiver) are used simultaneously we call the method dual mode. Using this method, it is possible to use devices with a large variation of states simultaneously on a tabletop, thus having more interactive devices on the surface.\nTitle:\nDual mode IR position and state transfer for tangible tabletops\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

As a decentralized optimization scheme, we introduce the dynamics of the mutually connected neural network dynamics, whose energy function autonomously minimizes by distributed update of each neuron. Since the objective function of the fairness becomes a fourth-order function of the neurons' states which cannot be optimized by the conventional Hopfield neural network, we apply a neural network model extended to higherorder mutual connections and energy functions. By numerical simulation, we confirm that the proposed algorithm can optimize fairness of the throughput by distributed and autonomous computation.\nTitle:\nApplication of higher order neural network dynamics to distributed radio resource usage optimization of cognitive wireless networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Although it has received increasing attention recently, there exists no graphical notation for it up until now that is both expressive enough to cover well-known resource selection conditions and independent of any BP modelling language. In this paper, we introduce RALph, a graphical notation for the assignment of human resources to BP activities. We define its semantics by mapping this notation to a language that has been formally defined in description logics, which enables its automated analysis. Although we show how RALph can be seamlessly integrated with BPMN, it is noteworthy that the notation is independent of the BP modelling language. Altogether, RALph will foster the visual modelling of the resource perspective in BPs.\nTitle:\nRALph: A Graphical Notation for Resource Assignments in Business Processes\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, prior to the results presented here, there appeared to be no practical threshold cryptosystems in the literature that were provably chosen ciphertext secure, even in the idealized random oracle model. The contribution of this paper is to present two very practical threshold cryptosystems, and to prove that they are secure against chosen ciphertext attack in the random oracle model. Not only are these protocols computationally very efficient, but they are also non-interactive, which means they can be easily run over an asynchronous communication network.\nTitle:\nSecuring Threshold Cryptosystems against Chosen Ciphertext Attack\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we present OAR, a formal framework to address the question of how the agents should interact in an evolving environment in order to achieve their different goals. The traditional categorization of self-interested and cooperative agents is unified by adopting a utility view. We illustrate mathematically that the degree of cooperativeness of an agent and the degree of its selfdirectness are not directly related. We also show how OAR can be used to evaluate different negotiation strategies and to develop distributed mechanisms that optimize the performance dynamically. This research demonstrates that sophisticated probabilistic modeling can be used to understand the behaviors of a system with complex agent interactions.\nTitle:\nOAR: a formal framework for multi-agent negotiation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It is essential to minimize every possible uncertainty during the biometric feature extraction process. In fingerprint feature extraction, it is perceived that pixel-level image rotation transformation is a lossless transformation process. In this paper, an investigation has been conducted on analyzing the underlying mechanisms of fingerprint image rotation processing and potential effect on the major features, mainly minutiae and singular point, of the rotation transformed fingerprint. Qualitative and quantitative analyses have been provided based on intensive experiments. It is observed that the information integrity of the original fingerprint image can be significantly compromised by image rotation transformation process, which can cause noticeable singular point change and produce a non-negligible number of fake minutiae. It is found that the quantization and interpolation process can change the fingerprint features significantly without affecting the visual image. Experiments show that up to 7% bio-cryptographic key bits can be affected due to this rotation transformation.\nTitle:\nA pitfall in fingerprint bio-cryptographic key generation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of evolutionary trees that are used to represent histories for species that have undergone reticulate evolution, an important evolutionary force for many organisms (e.g. plants or viruses). In this paper, we present a novel approach to understanding the structure of networks that are not necessarily binary. More specifically, we define the concept of a closed set and show that the collection of closed sets of a network forms a hierarchy, and that this hierarchy can be deduced from either the subtrees or subnetworks on all 3-subsets. This allows us to also show that closed sets generalize the concept of the SN-sets of a binary network, sets which have proven very useful in elucidating the structure of binary networks. We also characterize the minimal closed sets (under set inclusion) for a special class of networks (2-terminal networks). Taken together, we anticipate that our results should be useful for the development of new phylogenetic network reconstruction algorithms.\nTitle:\nHierarchies from Lowest Stable Ancestors in Nonbinary Phylogenetic Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To facilitate the development of effective e-learning systems, scalable technologies that support an arbitrary number of users while providing them with a good learning environment are needed. In this introduction, we provide an overview of e-learning system development with respect to a layered reference architecture, including the Internet infrastructure layer, the conceptual/modeling layer, and the application layer. In addition, the three articles included in this special issue cover the issues of managing the learning objects in an open and scalable architecture, incorporation of learners' pedagogical features in Web-based learning environments, and support of digital game-based learning. All these issues, though not exhaustive, are important to ensure successful development of e-learning systems on an Internet platform.\nTitle:\nGuest Editors' Introduction: Emerging Internet Technologies for E-Learning\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The performance and applicability largely depends on the complexity of the model in use. For complex models, the costs of creating a full test-suite can be significant. If the model is changed, then in general the test-suite is completely regenerated. However, only a subset of a test-suite might be invalidated by a model change. Creating a full test-suite in such a case would therefore waste time by unnecessarily recreating valid test-cases. This paper investigates methods to reduce the effort of recreating test-suites after a model is changed. This is also related to regression testing, where the number of test-cases necessary after a change should be minimized. This paper presents and evaluates methods to identify obsolete test-cases, and to extend any given test-case generation approach based on model-checkers in order to create test-cases for test-suite update or regression testing.\nTitle:\nHandling Model Changes: Regression Testing and Test-Suite Update with Model-Checkers\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

When multiple corpora are available, it has also been shown that when using a domain adaptation technique such as feature augmentation [1], the performance on each individual domain can be improved by training a joint model across all of the corpora. In this paper, we explore whether improving each domain model via joint training also improves performance when interpolating the models together. We show that the diversity of the individual models is an important consideration, and propose a method for adjusting diversity to optimize overall performance. We present results using word n-gram models and Model M, a class-based n-gram model, and demonstrate improvements in both perplexity and word-error rate relative to state-of-the-art results on a Broadcast News transcription task.\nTitle:\nJoint training of interpolated exponential n-gram models.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It tries to reflect the profile of this area by focusing more on those subjects that have been given more importance in the literature. In this context, most of the paper is devoted to partitional algorithms that look for hard clusterings of data, though overlapping (i.e., soft and fuzzy) approaches are also covered in the paper. The paper is original in what concerns two main aspects. First, it provides an up-to-date overview that is fully devoted to evolutionary algorithms for clustering, is not limited to any particular kind of evolutionary approach, and comprises advanced topics like multiobjective and ensemble-based evolutionary clustering. Second, it provides a taxonomy that highlights some very important aspects in the context of evolutionary data clustering, namely, fixed or variable number of clusters, cluster-oriented or nonoriented operators, context-sensitive or context-insensitive operators, guided or unguided operators, binary, integer, or real encodings, centroid-based, medoid-based, label-based, tree-based, or graph-based representations, among others. A number of references are provided that describe applications of evolutionary algorithms for clustering in different domains, such as image processing, computer security, and bioinformatics.

We show that existing inference control methods are usually inefficient for MDR queries. We then consider parity-based inference control that restricts users to queries involving an even number of sensitive values. Such a restriction renders inferences significantly more difficult, because an even number is closed under addition and subtraction, whereas inferences target at one value. However, more sophisticated inferences are still possible with only even MDR queries. We show that the collection of all even MDR queries causes inferences if and only if a special collection of sum-two queries (that is, the summation of exactly two values) does so. The result leads to an inference control method with an improved computational complexity O(mn) (over the previous result of O(m 2n)) for m MDR queries over n values. We show that no odd MDR queries can be answered without causing inferences. We show how to check non-MDR queries for inferences in linear time. We also show how to find large inference-free subsets of even MDR queries when they do cause inferences.\nTitle:\nParity-based inference control for multi-dimensional range sum queries\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The fact that a single gene locus may give rise to multiple mRNAs and protein isoforms, showing both major and subtle structural variations, is an exceptionally versatile tool in the optimization of the coding capacity of the eukaryotic genome. The huge and continuously increasing number of genome and transcript sequences provides an essential information source for the computational detection of genes AS pattern. However, much of this information is not optimally or comprehensively used in gene annotation by current genome annotation pipelines. We present here a web resource implementing the ASPIC algorithm which we developed previously for the investigation of AS of user submitted genes, based on comparative analysis of available transcript and genome data from a variety of species. The ASPIC web resource provides graphical and tabular views of the splicing patterns of all full-length mRNA isoforms compatible with the detected splice sites of genes under investigation as well as relevant structural and functional annotation. The ASPIC web resource available at http://www.caspur.it/ASPIC/- is dynamically interconnected with the Ensembl and Unigene databases and also implements an upload facility.\nTitle:\nASPIC: a web resource for alternative splicing prediction and transcript isoforms characterization.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, previous work has not investigated situations in which we would like to control the length of encoder-decoder outputs. This capability is crucial for applications such as text summarization, in which we have to generate concise summaries with a desired length. In this paper, we propose methods for controlling the output sequence length for neural encoder-decoder models: two decoding-based methods and two learning-based methods. Results show that our learning-based methods have the capability to control length without degrading summary quality in a summarization task.\nTitle:\nControlling Output Length in Neural Encoder-Decoders.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Using the continuity of text from books, we train an encoder-decoder model that tries to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an encoded passage. Sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties are thus mapped to similar vector representations. We next introduce a simple vocabulary expansion method to encode words that were not seen as part of training, allowing us to expand our vocabulary to a million words. After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity datasets. The end result is an off-the-shelf encoder that can produce highly generic sentence representations that are robust and perform well in practice.\nTitle:\nSkip-Thought Vectors\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This paper proposes a moving object detection algorithm adapting to various scene changes in a moving camera. In the moving camera scene, both backgrounds and objects are moving while the level of illumination in general varies frequently. To handle these scene changes, we propose a scene conditional background update scheme that adaptively builds the background according to how the scene changes. First, we estimate the three scene condition variables of background motion, foreground motion and illumination changes for an awareness of the scene condition. We then compensate for the camera movement and update the background model in different ways according to the scene condition. Lastly, we propose a new foreground decision method with a foreground likelihood map, two thresholds, and a watershed algorithm to generate a spatially connected foreground region. We validate the effectiveness of our method quantitatively and qualitatively with ten videos in various scene conditions.

These annotations contain semantic data, such as land usage, building age, and window/door labels. In a second phase, the semantics are automatically interpreted to populate the scene and trigger special behaviors in the crowd, depending on the location of the characters.

Since speed and memory are crucial aspects in enhancing the performance of mobile applications and websites, a better technique for Web loading process should be investigated. The weaknesses of the conventional Web caching policy include meaningless information and uncertainty of knowledge representation in Web logs data from the proxy cache to mobile-client. The organisation and learning task of the knowledge-processing for Web logs data require explicit representation to deal with uncertainties. This is due to the exponential growth of rules for finding a suitable knowledge representation from the proxy cache to the mobileclient. Consequently, Rough Set is chosen in this research to generate Web pre-caching decision rules to ensure the meaningless Web log data can be changed to meaningful information.\nTitle:\nMeaningless to meaningful Web log data for generation of Web pre-caching decision rules using Rough Set\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In an effort to better understand the complex interplay between one\u2019s medical condition and social, environmental, and metabolic parameters, this article presents the KNOWME platform, a complete, end-to-end, body area sensing system that integrates off-the-shelf biometric sensors with a Nokia N95 mobile phone to continuously monitor the metabolic signals of a subject. With a current focus on pediatric obesity, KNOWME employs metabolic signals to monitor and evaluate physical activity. KNOWME development and in-lab deployment studies have revealed three major challenges: (1) the need for robustness to highly varying operating environments due to subject-induced variability, such as mobility or sensor placement; (2) balancing the tension between achieving high fidelity data collection and minimizing network energy consumption; and (3) accurate physical activity detection using a modest number of sensors. The KNOWME platform described herein directly addresses these three challenges. Design robustness is achieved by creating a three-tiered sensor data collection architecture. The system architecture is designed to provide robust, continuous, multichannel data collection and scales without compromising normal mobile device operation. Novel physical activity detection methods which exploit new representations of sensor signals provide accurate and efficient physical activity detection. The physical activity detection method employs personalized training phases and accounts for intersession variability. Finally, exploiting the features of the hardware implementation, a low-complexity sensor sampling algorithm is developed, resulting in significant energy savings without loss of performance.\nTitle:\nKNOWME: An Energy-Efficient Multimodal Body Area Network for Physical Activity Monitoring\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The proposed new approach makes use of realistic statistical models to detect vessels more accurately than conventional intensity gradient-based approaches. In this paper, rather than using MRA speed images alone, as in prior work [7,8,10], we define a 3D local phase coherence (LPC) measure to incorporate velocity field information. The proposed new approach is an extension of our previous work in 2D vascular segmentation [5,6], and is formulated in a variational framework, which is implemented using the recently proposed modified level set method [1]. Experiments on flow phantoms, as well as on clinical data sets, show that our approach can segment normal vasculature as well as low flow (low SNR) or complex flow regions, especially in an aneurysm.\nTitle:\n3D Vascular Segmentation Using MRA Statistics and Velocity Field Information in PC-MRA\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A mathematical morphology based post-processing algorithm is presented in this paper for image ringing artifact suppression. First, we use binary morphological operators to isolate the regions of an image where the Pinging artifact is most prominent to human visual system (HVS) while preserving genuine edges and other (high-frequency) fine details present in the image. Then, a gray-level morphological nonlinear smoothing filter is applied to the unmasked regions of the image? under the filtering mask to eliminate ringing within this constraint region. To gauge the effectiveness of this approach, we propose an HVS compatible objective measure of the ringing artifact. Preliminary simulations indicate that the proposed method is capable of significantly reducing the ringing artifact on both subjective and objective basis.\nTitle:\nImage Coding Ringing Artifact Reduction Using Morphological Post-Filtering\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Many energy-efficient mobile solutions vary the CPU and GPU voltage/frequency to save power consumption. However, energy-aware control over the memory bus connecting the various on-chip subsystems has had much less interest. This measurement-based study first analyse the CPU, GPU and memory cost (i.e. product of utilisation and frequency) of user-centric smartphone workloads. The impact of memory frequency scaling on power consumption and quality-of-service is also measured. We also present a preliminary analysis into the frequency levels selected by the different default governors of the CPU/GPU/memory components. We show that an interdependency exists between the CPU and memory governors and that it may cause unnecessary increase in power consumption, due to interference with the CPU frequency governor. The observations made in this measurement-based study can also reveal some design insights to system designers.\n\n\nTitle:\nImpact of memory frequency scaling on user-centric smartphone workloads.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Therefore, MCML is suitable to protect cryptographic hardware from Differential Power Analysis and similar side-channel attacks. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of different logic styles against power analysis attacks, two full cores implementing the AES algorithm were realized and implemented with CMOS and MCML technology, and a set of different types of attack was performed using power traces derived from SPICE-level simulations.

The proposed scheme adopts an autoregressive (AR) model for the delay process. The adopted AR model is a natural generalization of the Jacobson's algorithm in TCP retransmission timeout (RTO) estimation. However, unlike fixed parameter values in the Jacobson's algorithm, the parameters of the proposed scheme adapt themselves to the estimation error via a robust identification algorithm. This robust identification algorithm usually leads to better performance when the noise is correlated and/or non-stationary, and it is also more robust to modeling uncertainties. As an application of the proposed algorithm, we consider the problem of delay prediction for audio playout buffering.

We discuss the efficiency and robustness gains of price-based multilateral exchange, and show that simply maintaining a single price per peer (even across multiple files) suffices to achieve these benefits. Our main contribution is a system design---PACE (Price-Assisted Content Exchange)---that effectively and practically realizes multilateral exchange. Its centerpiece is a market-based mechanism for exchanging currency for desired content, with a single, decentralized price per peer. Honest users are completely shielded from any notion of prices, budgeting, allocation, or other market issues, yet strategic or malicious clients cannot unduly damage the system's efficient operation. Our design encourages sharing of desirable content and network-friendly resource utilization. Bilateral barter-based systems such as BitTorrent have been attractive in large part because of their simplicity. Our research takes a significant step in understanding the efficiency and robustness gains possible with multilateral exchange.\nTitle:\nPeer-assisted content distribution with prices\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To learn an effective action classifier, most of the previous approaches rely on enough training labels. When being required to recognize the action in a different dataset, these approaches have to re-train the model using new labels. However, labeling video sequences is a very tedious and time-consuming task, especially when detailed spatial locations and time durations are required. In this paper, we propose an adaptive action detection approach which reduces the requirement of training labels and is able to handle the task of cross-dataset action detection with few or no extra training labels. Our approach combines model adaptation and action detection into a Maximum a Posterior (MAP) estimation framework, which explores the spatial-temporal coherence of actions and makes good use of the prior information which can be obtained without supervision. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on KTH action dataset using only 50% of the training labels in tradition approaches. Furthermore, we show that our approach is effective for the cross-dataset detection which adapts the model trained on KTH to two other challenging datasets.\nTitle:\nCross-dataset action detection\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The components in our model are no longer terms, but termsets. The novelty is that we compute term weights using a data mining technique called association rules, which is time efficient and yet yields nice improvements in retrieval effectiveness. The set-based model function for computing the similarity between a document and a query considers the termset frequency in the document and its scarcity in the document collection. Experimental results show that our model improves the average precision of the answer set for all three collections evaluated. For the TReC-3 collection, our set-based model led to a gain, relative to the standard vector space model, of 37% in average precision curves and of 57% in average precision for the top 10 documents. Like the vector space model, the set-based model has time complexity that is linear in the number of documents in the collection.\nTitle:\nSet-based model: a new approach for information retrieval\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Human beings are not only data consumers, but data producer with their objective or subjective sensing needs. Mobile crowd sensing is an emerging computing paradigm that tasks everyday mobile devices to form participatory sensor networks. It allows the increasing number of mobile phone users to share local knowledge acquired by their sensor-enhanced devices. Social sensors, social sensor receiver platform, and mobile crowd sensing paradigm compose a process by which physical sensors present in mobile devices such as GPS are used to infer social relationships and human activities. In this survey, we review the mobile crowd sensing applications on social sensors based on social sensor receiver platform (e.g., Weibo and Twitter) from three categories: public security, smart city, and location based services. Most applications adopted in current works fit in one of these categories. Existing works on applications of mobile crowd sensing on social sensors are collected and studied. Some possible future directions of potential new application category are proposed and analyzed.\nTitle:\nMobile crowd sensing of human-like intelligence using social sensors: A survey.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous cartoon gesture recognition method with applications. Firstly, heterogeneous features with different dimensions are assigned to express cartoon and human-subject images according to their characteristics. Then for recognition, we simultaneously integrate shared structure learning (SSL) and graph-based transductive learning into a joint framework to learn reliable classifiers on heterogeneous features. Provided with the framework, the similarities between cartoon and human-subject gestures can be quantitatively evaluated in a cross-feature manner. Extensive experiments on self-defined datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. Finally, applications illustrate the usages in various aspects of 2D cartoon industry.\nTitle:\nRetrieval-based cartoon gesture recognition and applications via semi-supervised heterogeneous classifiers learning\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Most EAPM research explicitly used the probabilistic model from the parental distribution, then generated solutions by sampling from the probabilistic model without using genetic operators. Although EAPM is promising in solving different kinds of problems, self-guided GA doesn't intend to generate solution by the probabilistic model directly because the time complexity is high when we solve combinatorial problems, particularly the sequencing ones. As a result, the probabilistic model serves as a fitness surrogate which estimates the fitness of the new solution beforehand in this research. So the probabilistic model is used to guide the evolutionary process of crossover and mutation. This research studied the flowshop scheduling problems and the corresponding experiment were conducted. From the results, it shows that the self-guided GA outperformed other algorithms significantly. In addition, self-guided GA works more efficiently than previous EAPM. As a result, self-guided GA is promising in solving the flowshop scheduling problems.\nTitle:\nA self-guided genetic algorithm for flowshop scheduling problems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

As a result of a separable extension from 1D bases, the multidimensional wavelet transform has very limited directionality. Furthermore, different directions are mixed in certain wavelet subbands.

In the 2D case, it provides one lowpass subband and six directional highpass subbands at each scale. Just like the wavelet transform, the proposed transform is nonredundant, and can be easily extended to higher dimensions.

Various approaches have been developed to call whether germline SNVs (or SNPs) in normal cells or somatic SNVs in cancer/tumor cells. Nonetheless, efficient callers for both germline and somatic SNVs have not yet been extensively investigated. In this paper, we present SNVSniffer, an integrated caller for germline and somatic SNVs from NGS data based on Bayesian probabilistic models. In SNVSniffer, our germline SNV calling models allele counts per site as a multinomial conditional distribution. Meanwhile, our somatic SNV calling relies on NGS tumor-normal sample pairs, and introduces a hybrid approach combining a subtraction approach with a joint sample analysis which models tumor-normal allele counts per site as a joint multinomial conditional distribution. Moreover, we investigate a lightweight tumor purity estimation approach, which demonstrates high accuracy on synthetic tumors. Compared to some leading SNP callers (SAMtools, GATK and FaSD) and somatic SNV callers (VarScan2, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix2, MuTect), SNVSniffer demonstrates comparable or even better accuracy at faster speed.

Unfortunately, integrating existing components practically means adaptation and use rather than use only, which makes an ideal component-based development hard to realize in practice. Product line engineering, however, tackles this problem by making components as generic as needed for a particular product family and thus allows component reuse. Such a component covers variabilities and thus its implementation must consider variabilities as well.In this paper, we describe a process for implementing generic product line components and give an overview of variability mechanisms at the implementation level, illustrated by a running example, a generic test component.\nTitle:\nGeneric Implementation of Product Line Components\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The alignments use not only substitutions, insertions, and deletions of single nucleotides, but also inversions, which are the reversed complements, of substrings of the sequences. With the restriction that the inversions are pairwise non-intersecting, their proposed algorithm runs in O(n2m2) time and consumes O(n2m2) space, where n and m are the lengths of the input sequences, respectively. We develop a space-efficient algorithm to compute such an optimal alignment which consumes only O(nm) space within the same amount of time. Our algorithm enables the computation for a pair of DNA sequences of length up to 10,000 to be carried out on an ordinary desktop computer.

In this paper, an adaptive bilateral control scheme is proposed for the nonlinear teleoperation with parameterized dynamic uncertainties and time delays. Compared to the existing time-delay adaptive bilateral controllers, the proposed scheme has the advantage of faster and more accurate parameter adaptation. In this way, the transient performance of teleoperators can be improved without increasing the control gains, which is helpful for stability of teleoperation. The adaptive bilateral controller is designed to be applicable both in free motion and in constrained motion. The synchronization errors in the unconstrained subspace are asymptotically convergent under time delays. In the constrained subspace, the contact force remains bounded with the proposed controller. The stability of teleoperation is proved using Lyapunov methods and the passivity theory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nTitle:\nAdaptive bilateral control for nonlinear uncertain teleoperation with guaranteed transient performance\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It further updates the trajectory predictions on-line to provide an intention-based trajectory prediction and collision avoidance adapted to various driving manners and road/weather conditions. The effectiveness of this concept is demonstrated by a variety of simulations utilizing real human driving data in various scenarios including an intersection and a highway.

However, existing solutions can compute the gaze direction without providing the distance to the target. In addition, most of them rely on special devices or infrastructure support. This paper explores the possibility of using a smartphone to detect the visual attention of a user. By applying the proposed VADS system, acquiring the location of the intended object only requires one simple action: gazing at the intended object and holding up the smartphone so that the object as well as user's face can be simultaneously captured by the front and rear cameras. We extend the current advances of computer vision to develop efficient algorithms to obtain the distance between the camera and user, the user's gaze direction, and the object's direction from camera. The object's location can then be computed by solving a trigonometric problem. VADS has been prototyped on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. Extensive evaluation results show that VADS achieves low error (about 1.5\u00b0 in angle and 0.15m in distance for objects within 12m) as well as short latency. We believe that VADS enables a large variety of applications in smart environments.\nTitle:\nVADS: Visual attention detection with a smartphone\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

How to incentivize users to park bikes at desired locations that match bike demands - a problem which we refer to as a rebalancing problem - has emerged as a new and interesting challenge. In this paper, we propose a solution under a crowdsourcing framework where users report their original destinations and the bike sharing platform assigns proper relocation tasks to them. We first prove two impossibility results: (1) finding an optimal solution to the bike rebalancing problem is NP-hard, and (2) there is no approximate mechanism with bounded approximation ratio that is both truthful and budget-feasible. Therefore, we design a two-stage heuristic mechanism which selects an independent set of locations in the first stage and allocates tasks to users in the second stage. We show analytically that the mechanism satisfies location truthfulness, budget feasibility and individual rationality. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address 2-D location truthfulness in the perspective of mechanism design.\nTitle:\nAchieving Location Truthfulness in Rebalancing Supply-Demand Distribution for Bike Sharing.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, the relationships between four suboptimal quadratic detection schemes, namely, the energy, matched subspace, maximum deflection ratio as well as spectrum matching detectors, and the LRT are studied. In particular, we show that each of those suboptimal detectors can approach the optimal LRT under certain operating conditions.

With the rapid development of the Internet, automatic hyponymy acquisition from the web has become a hot research topic. However, due to the polysemous terms and casual expressions on the web, a large number of irrelevant or incorrect terms will be inevitably extracted and introduced to the results during the automatic discovering process. Thus the automatic web-based methods will probably fail because of the large number of irrelevant terms. This paper presents a novel approach of web-based hyponymy discovery, where we propose a term verification method based on hyponymy hierarchical characteristics. In this way, irrelevant and incorrect terms can be rejected effectively. The experimental results show that our approach can discover large number of cohesive relations automatically with high precision.\nTitle:\nVerification Based on Hyponymy Hierarchical Characteristics for Web-Based Hyponymy Discovery.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This imaging technique produces a set of irregularly spaced B-scans. Reconstructing a regular grid from these B-scans is a challenging problem that enables the visualization and further analysis of the acquired data. This paper focuses on extending an existing method [1] to define the output reconstruction grid based on principal component analysis (PCA). Our method introduces a model for the region of interest (ROI) in order to adapt the grid to the ROI. In addition, a technique based on normalized convolution is proposed for the interpolation problem. A new applicability function based on the correlation function of a linear probe is used to avoid inter-resolution cell blurring.\nTitle:\nFreehand Ultrasound Reconstruction Based on ROI Prior Modeling and Normalized Convolution\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our strategy is to estimate node positions and noise distributions of all links in the network simultaneously - a strategy that has not been attempted thus far. In particular, we account for biased, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) range measurements from ultra-wideband (UWB) devices that lead to multi-modal noise distributions, for which few solutions exist to date. Our approach circumvents cumbersome a-priori calibration, allows for rapid deployment in unknown environments, and facilitates adaptation to changing conditions. Our first contribution is a generalization of the classical multidimensional scaling algorithm to account for measurements that have multi-modal error distributions. Our second contribution is an online approach that iterates between node localization and noise parameter estimation. We validate our method in 3-dimensional networks, (i) through simulation to test the sensitivity of the algorithm on its design parameters, and (ii) through physical experimentation in a NLOS environment. Our setup uses UWB devices that provide time-of-flight measurements, which can lead to positively biased distance measurements in NLOS conditions. We show that our algorithm converges to accurate position estimates, even when initial position estimates are very uncertain, initial error models are unknown, and a significant proportion of the network links are in NLOS.\nTitle:\nCalibration-free network localization using non-line-of-sight ultra-wideband measurements.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Pure page mapped FTL, which maintains page-level address mappings, is known as the most efficient FTL. However, its huge SRAM requirement to load the entire mapping table limited adoption of its use. In order to reduce SRAM space utilization while maintaining comparable performance, we can selectively cache page-level address mappings into a small SRAM. However, the performance of this approach is limited by miss ratio of cached mapping table (CMT) on SRAM. In this paper, we propose a replica approach of the page-mapped FTL on flash, called Replica to minimize the performance penalty of CMT miss.\nTitle:\nMinimizing CMT Miss Penalty in Selective Page-Level Address Mapping Table\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In most interesting cases, however, full global optimization is not feasible and local search techniques are used to discover reasonable solutions. Unfortunately, the quality of the local maxima reached depends on initialization and is often weaker than the global maximum. In this paper, we present a simple approach for combining global search with local optimization to discover improved hypotheses in general machine learning problems. The main idea is to escape local maxima by perturbing the training data to create plausible new ascent directions, rather than perturbing hypotheses directly. Specifically, we consider example-reweighting strategies that are reminiscent of boosting and other ensemble learning methods, but applied in a different way with a different goal: to produce a single hypothesis that achieves a good score on training and test data. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms we consider a number of problems in learning Bayesian networks from data, including discrete training problems (structure search), continuous training problems (parametric EM, non-linear logistic regression), and mixed training problems (Structural EM)- on both synthetic and real-world data. In each case, we obtain state of the art performance on both training and test data.\nTitle:\nData perturbation for escaping local maxima in learning\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This is done by grouping variable values and treating the combined values as a single entity. As we show, such abstractions can exploit regularities in conditional probability distributions and also the specific values of observed variables. To formally justify value abstraction, we define the notion of safe value abstraction and devise inference algorithms that use it to reduce the cost of inference. Our procedure is particularly useful for learning complex networks with many hidden variables. In such cases, repeated likelihood computations are required for EM or other parameter optimization techniques. Since these computations are repeated with respect to the same evidence set, our methods can provide significant speedup to the learning procedure. We demonstrate the algorithm on genetic linkage problems where the use of value abstraction sometimes differentiates between a feasible and non-feasible solution.\nTitle:\nLikelihood Computations Using Value Abstraction\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The principal contribution of this paper is a demonstration that the partitioned synchronization rule also applies to more general structures than semitrees, specifically, to any planar extendible partial order, a partial order which when extended with a least and a greatest element still remains planar. To demonstrate utility, the paper presents two applications of the partitioned synchronization rule. The first application shows correctness of a component-based timestamp generation algorithm suitable for implementing a timestamp ordering concurrency control algorithm. The second application shows correctness of a snapshot algorithm for concurrency control in a replicated multilevel secure database; we choose this application to highlight that hierarchically decomposed databases and multilevel secure databases are structurally similar. In both cases, the correctness proofs via the partitioned synchronization rule are substantially simpler than corresponding direct proofs.\nTitle:\nThe Partitioned Synchronization Rule for Planar Extendible Partial Orders\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This means that a set (vertex) can only cover a limited number of its elements (adjacent edges) and the number of available copies of each set (vertex) is bounded. This is a natural generalization of the classical problems that also captures resource limitations in practical scenarios.We obtain the following results. For the unweighted vertex cover problem with hard capacities we give a 3-approximation algorithm which is based on randomized rounding with alterations. We prove that the weighted version is at least as hard as the set cover problem. This is an interesting separation between the approximability of weighted and unweighted versions of a \"natural\" graph problem. A logarithmic approximation factor for both the set cover and the weighted vertex cover problem with hard capacities follows from the work of Wolsey [23] on submodular set cover. We provide in this paper a simple and intuitive proof for this bound.\nTitle:\nCovering Problems with Hard Capacities\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract We consider a system of parallel servers handling users of various classes, whose service rates depend not only on user classes, but also on the set of active servers. We in- vestigate the stability under two types of allocation strategies: (i) server assignment where the users are assigned to servers based on rates, load, and other considerations, and (ii) co- ordinated scheduling where the activity states of servers are coordinated. We show how the model may be applied to evaluate the downlink capacity of wireless data networks. Specif- ically, we examine the potential gains in wireless capacity from the two types of resource allocation strategies.\nTitle:\nInteracting queues with server selection and coordinated scheduling - application to cellular data networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The payment structure of these interconnections are often negotiated and maintained via bilateral agreements. Current differences of opinion in the appropriate revenue model in the Internet has on occasion caused ISPs to de-peer from one another, hindering network connectivity and availability. Our previous work demonstrates that the Shapley value has several desirable properties, and that if applied as the revenue model, selfish ISPs would yield globally optimal routing and interconnecting decisions. In this paper, we focus our investigation of Shapley value in networks with two basic classes of ISP: content and eyeball. In particular, we analyze the revenue distribution between ISPs with elastic and inelastic customer demands, and calculate the bilateral payments between ISPs that implement the Shapley revenue. Our results illustrate how ISP revenues are influenced by different demand models. In particular, the marginal revenue lost by de-peering for an eyeball ISP with inelastic demand is inversely proportional to the square of its degree of connectivity to content ISPs. In practice, these results provide a guideline for ISPs, even in peering relationships, to negotiate bilateral payments and for regulatory institutions to design pricing regulations.\nTitle:\nInterconnecting eyeballs to content: a shapley value perspective on isp peering and settlement\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

DL-Lite is at the basis of OWL 2 QL, one of the tractable fragments of OWL 2, the recently proposed revision of the Web Ontology Language. We propose some fundamental principles that KB evolution should respect. We review known model and formula-based approaches for evolution of propositional theories. We exhibit limitations of a number of model-based approaches: besides the fact that they are either not expressible in DL-Lite or hard to compute, they intrinsically ignore the structural properties of KBs, which leads to undesired properties of KBs resulting from such an evolution. We also examine proposals on update and revision of DL KBs that adopt the model-based approaches and discuss their drawbacks. We show that known formula-based approaches are also not appropriate for DL-Lite evolution, either due to high complexity of computation, or because the result of such an action of evolution is not expressible in DL-Lite. Building upon the insights gained, we propose two novel formula-based approaches that respect our principles and for which evolution is expressible in DL-Lite. For our approaches we also developed polynomial time algorithms to compute evolution of DL-Lite KBs.\nTitle:\nEvolution of DL-lite knowledge bases\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This information is used to define a point-to-point correspondence between simplified and hires meshes. Moreover, we introduce a number of criteria for measuring the quality (visual or otherwise) of a given mapping method, and provide efficient algorithms to implement them.

We present a novel image deconvolution algorithm that deblurs and denoises an image given a known shift-invariant blur kernel. Our algorithm uses local color statistics derived from the image as a constraint in a unified framework that can be used for deblurring, denoising, and upsampling. A pixel's color is required to be a linear combination of the two most prevalent colors within a neighborhood of the pixel. This two-color prior has two major benefits: it is tuned to the content of the particular image and it serves to decouple edge sharpness from edge strength. Our unified algorithm for deblurring and denoising out-performs previous methods that are specialized for these individual applications. We demonstrate this with both qualitative results and extensive quantitative comparisons that show that we can out-perform previous methods by approximately 1 to 3 DB.\nTitle:\nImage Deblurring And Denoising Using Color Priors\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We show that three factors are strong predictors of performance in isolation: the amount of reordering, the morphological complexity of the target language and the historical relatedness of the two languages.

The theory is validated on some case studies, related to nominal calculi (pi-calculus) and visual specification formalisms (Petri nets).

It permits to classify several types of data without an explicit information about it. In many cases researchers use analysis methodologies such as clustering to classify data with respect to the patterns and conditions together. But in the last few years new analysis tool such as a biclustering were proposed and applied to the many specific problems. Biclustering algorithms permit not only to classify data with respect to selected conditions, but also to find the conditions that permit to classify data with a better precision. Recently we proposed a biclustering technique based on the Possibilistic Clustering paradigm (PBC algorithm) [1] that is able to find one bicluster at a time. In this paper we propose an improvement to the Possibilistic Biclustering algorithm (PBC Bagging) that permits to find find several biclusters by using the statistical method of Bootstrap aggregation. We applied the algorithm to a synthetic data and to the Yeast dataset, obtaining fast convergence and good quality solutions. A comparison with original PBC method is also presented.\nTitle:\nBiclustering by resampling\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The device may be complicated to control and the nonstationary nature of the brain signals provides for a rather unstable input. With the use of intelligent processing algorithms adapted to the task at hand, however, the performance can be increased. This paper introduces a shared control system that helps the subject in driving an intelligent wheelchair with a noninvasive brain interface. The subject's steering intentions are estimated from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and passed through to the shared control system before being sent to the wheelchair motors. Experimental results show a possibility for significant improvement in the overall driving performance when using the shared control system compared to driving without it. These results have been obtained with 2 healthy subjects during their first day of training with the brain-actuated wheelchair.\nTitle:\nContext-based filtering for assisted brain-actuated wheelchair driving\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this document we review phenomenological models of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, in particular spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper are suitable for large-scale network simulations.\nTitle:\nPhenomenological models of synaptic plasticity based on spike timing.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

With the advent of flash memory in the gap between traditional RAM main memory and traditional disk systems, the five-minute rule now applies to large pages appropriate for today's disks and their fast transfer bandwidths, and it also applies to flash disks holding small pages appropriate for their fast access latency. Flash memory fills the gap between RAM and disks in terms of many metrics: acquisition cost, access latency, transfer bandwidth, spatial density, and power consumption. Thus, within a few years, flash memory will likely be used heavily in operating systems, file systems, and database systems. Research into appropriate system architectures is urgently needed. The basic software architectures for exploiting flash in these systems are called \"extended buffer pool\" and \"extended disk\" here. Based on the characteristics of these software architectures, an argument is presented why operating systems and file systems on one hand and database systems on the other hand will best benefit from flash memory by employing different software architectures.\nTitle:\nThe five-minute rule twenty years later, and how flash memory changes the rules\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, little work about automating negotiation of complex business contract has been done so far although it is a kind of the most important negotiation in business. In order to address this issue, in this paper we developed an automated system for this kind of negotiation. This system is based on the principled negotiation theory, which is the most effective method of negotiation in the domain of business. The system is developed as a knowledge-based one because a negotiating agent in business has to be economically intelligent and capable of making effective decisions based on business experiences and knowledge. Finally, the validity of the developed system is shown in a real negotiation scenario where on behalf of human users, the system successfully performed a negotiation of a complex business contract between a wholesaler and a retailer. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\nTitle:\nA Knowledge Based System of Principled Negotiation for Complex Business Contract.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, most researchers develop tailor-made GP tools for solving specific problems. These tools generally require significant modifications in their kernel to be adapted to other domains. In this paper, we explore the Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming (GGGP) approach as an alternative to overcome such limitation. We describe a GGGP based framework, named Chameleon, that can be easily configured to solve different problems. We explore the use of Chameleon in two domains, not usually addressed by works in the literature: in the task of mining relational databases and in the software testing activity. The presented results point out that the use of the grammar-guided approach helps us to obtain more generic GP frameworks and that they can contribute in the explored domains.\nTitle:\nA Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming Framework Configured For Data Mining And Software Testing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The method proceeds in three steps. Firstly, the reference images are preprocessed for extracting edge pixels. Secondly, an inverse warping is performed to render the desired image from one primary reference image. By taking advantages of epipolar line features and depth discontinuities in reference images, the inverse warping can be efficiently applied by segments, to accelerate the rendering substantially. Finally, holes in the desired image are filled up through searching the corresponding points in other reference images. At this stage, two accelerating techniques are presented. By using the proposed algorithm we can navigate a virtual environment at interactive rate.\nTitle:\nEfficient 3D Image Warping for Composing Novel Views\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our mining process is guided by a meta-rule context driven by analysis objectives and exploits aggregate measures to revisit the definition of support and confidence.

Recently, graphical Granger modeling has gained considerable attention as a promising direction for addressing this problem. These methods apply graphical modeling methods on time-series data and invoke the notion of \u2018Granger causality\u2019 to make assertions on causality through inference on time-lagged effects. Existing algorithms, however, have neglected an important aspect of the problem\u2014the group structure among the lagged temporal variables naturally imposed by the time series they belong to. Specifically, existing methods in computational biology share this shortcoming, as well as additional computational limitations, prohibiting their effective applications to the large datasets including a large number of genes and many data points. In the present article, we propose a novel methodology which we term \u2018grouped graphical Granger modeling method\u2019, which overcomes the limitations mentioned above by applying a regression method suited for high-dimensional and large data, and by leveraging the group structure among the lagged temporal variables according to the time series they belong to. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on both simulated and actual gene expression data, specifically the human cancer cell (HeLa S3) cycle data. The simulation results show that the proposed methodology generally exhibits higher accuracy in recovering the underlying causal structure. Those on the gene expression data demonstrate that it leads to improved accuracy with respect to prediction of known links, and also uncovers additional causal relationships uncaptured by earlier works.

These needs are expressed using several criteria, which are used to evaluate the candidate data sources. An MCSS problem can be solved using multidimensional optimization techniques that trade off the different objectives. Sometimes one may have uncertain knowledge regarding how well the candidate data sources meet the criteria. In order to overcome this uncertainty, one may rely on end-users or crowds to annotate the data items produced by the sources in relation to the selection criteria. In this article, a proposed Targeted Feedback Collection (TFC) approach is introduced that aims to identify those data items on which feedback should be collected, thereby providing evidence on how the sources satisfy the required criteria. The proposed TFC targets feedback by considering the confidence intervals around the estimated criteria values, with a view to increasing the confidence in the estimates that are most relevant to the multidimensional optimization. Variants of the proposed TFC approach have been developed for use where feedback is expected to be reliable (e.g., where it is provided by trusted experts) and where feedback is expected to be unreliable (e.g., from crowd workers). Both variants have been evaluated, and positive results are reported against other approaches to feedback collection, including active learning, in experiments that involve real-world datasets and crowdsourcing.\n\n\nTitle:\nCrowdsourced Targeted Feedback Collection for Multicriteria Data Source Selection.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

One challenge faced by process discovery is to identify concurrency effectively. State-of-the-art approaches employ activity orders in traces to undertake process discovery and they require stringent completeness notions of event logs. Thus, they may fail to extract appropriate processes when event logs cannot meet the completeness criteria. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a novel technique which leverages activity dependences in traces. Based on the observation that activities with no dependencies can be executed in parallel, our technique is in a position to discover processes with concurrencies even if the logs fail to meet the completeness criteria. That is, our technique calls for a weaker notion of completeness. We evaluate our technique through experiments on both real-world and semi- synthetic event logs, and the conformance checking results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique and its relative advantages compared with state-of-the-art approaches.\nTitle:\nProcess Discovery from Dependence-Complete Event Logs\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It is believed that, in many cases, good approximations for combinatorial auctions may be unattainable due to an inherent clash between truthfulness and computational efficiency. In this paper, we prove the first computational-complexity in-approximability results for incentive-compatible mechanisms for combinatorial auctions. Our results are tight, hold for the important class of VCG-based mechanisms, and are based on the complexity assumption that NP has no polynomial-size circuits. We show two different techniques to obtain such lower bounds: one for deterministic mechanisms that attains optimal dependence on the number of players and number of items, and one that also applies to a class of randomized mechanisms and attains optimal dependence on the number of players. Both techniques are based on novel VC dimension machinery.\nTitle:\nInapproximability for VCG-based combinatorial auctions\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, a multiscale deformable registration framework is proposed by combining edge preserving scale space with the free form deformation (FFD) for registration of planning computed tomography (CT) images with daily cone beam CT (CBCT) images. The edge preserving scale space which is able to select edges and contours of an image according to their geometric size is derived from the total variation model with the L1 norm (TV-L1). At each scale, the selected edges and contours are sufficiently strong to drive the deformation using the FFD grid, then the deformation fields are gained by a coarse to fine manner. Furthermore, for automated registration we design an optimal estimation of the TV-L1 parameter by minimizing the defined offset. The experiments on CT and CBCT images show accuracy and robustness when compared to traditional methods.\nTitle:\nMultiscale Deformable Registration Using Edge Preserving Scale Space For Adaptive Radiation Therapy\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This paper goes further and explores a more general framework, in which computation is modeled as a process with a multitude of fluctuating tokens that interact with each other directly or via stigmergy. For the implementation of these concepts Single Electron Tunneling (SET) technology is a strong candidate, since it combines a key element of fluctuation-driven systems, i.e., fluctuating tokens, with the potential for manufacturing in traditional materials (silicon) as well as alternatives, such as molecules. We propose computational elements, i.e., Memory Enhanced Hubs (MEHs), that contain functionality to pass fluctuating signals through them, as well as stigmergic functionality to store a state temporarily and reset it. We introduce a SET based design of such a memory enhance hub instance and demonstrate by means of simulations that it function correctly and that MEHs networks operating according to the stigmergic paradigm can be constructed.\nTitle:\nStigmergic search with single electron tunneling technology based memory enhanced hubs\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, this issue has not yet been well addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel method by employing a recursive bargaining Strategy to gradually remove QoS constraint violations for Optimizing service composition execution Path. Our method mainly exploits the hidden market competitive relationships which widely exist in real business world for developing a novel bargaining strategy. Based on this strategy, concessions can be made by service providers to offer better QoS values. By recursively using bargaining strategy, an initial execution path built by a local optimization policy for service composition, can be continually updated to be close to the optimal one by reselecting better service providers for meeting overall end-to-end QoS requirements. An experiment and evaluation have been made to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method.\nTitle:\nGradual Removal of QoS Constraint Violations by Employing Recursive Bargaining Strategy for Optimizing Service Composition Execution Path\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In addition, a method to approximate the minimum (MIN) and maximum (MAX) gray level intensity is presented in the paper, which are the necessary information for contrast stretching. Experimental results show that the quality of images generated by the new algorithms are comparable with that of images generated by the corresponding methods in the spatial domain.\nTitle:\nEdge Enhancement Of Remote Sensing Image Data In The Dct Domain\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To handle this variability, an object recognition system must employ a representation that is either invariant to, or models this variability. This paper presents an appearance-based method for modeling the variability due to illumination in the images of objects. The method differs from past appearance-based methods, however, in that a small set of training images is used to generate a representation - the illumination cone - which models the complete set of images of an object with Lambertian reflectance map under an arbitrary combination of point light sources at infinity. This method is both an implementation and extension (an extension in that it models cast shadows) of the illumination cone representation proposed in [3]. The method is tested on a database of 660 images of 10 faces, and the results exceed those of popular existing methods.\nTitle:\nIllumination Cones for Recognition under Variable Lighting: Faces\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Given an n x m matrix A ( n >= m), the main goal of biclustering is to identify a subset of rows ( called objects) and a subset of columns ( called properties) such that some objective function that specifies the quality of the found bicluster ( formed by the subsets of rows and of columns of A) is optimized. The problem has been proved or conjectured to be NP-hard for various objective functions. In this article, we study a probabilistic model for the implanted additive bicluster problem, where each element in the n x m background matrix is a random integer from [0; L - 1] for some integer L, and a k x k implanted additive bicluster is obtained from an error-free additive bicluster by randomly changing each element to a number in [0; L - 1] with probability theta. We propose an O(n(2)m) time algorithm based on voting to solve the problem. We show that when k >= Omega (root n logn), the voting algorithm can correctly find the implanted bicluster with probability at least 1 - 9/n(2). We also implement our algorithm as a C++ program named VOTE. The implementation incorporates several ideas for estimating the size of an implanted bicluster, adjusting the threshold in voting, dealing with small biclusters, and dealing with overlapping implanted biclusters. Our experimental results on both simulated and real datasets show that VOTE can find biclusters with a high accuracy and speed.\nTitle:\nAn efficient voting algorithm for finding additive biclusters with random background.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Using an analogous reasoning, we present an approach that combines bag-of-words and spatial models to perform semantic and syntactic analysis for recognition of an object based on its internal appearance and its context. We argue that while object recognition requires modeling relative spatial locations of image features within the object, a bag-of-word is sufficient for representing context. Learning such a model from weakly labeled data involves labeling of features into two classes: foreground(object) or ''informative'' background(context). labeling. We present a ''shape-aware'' model which utilizes contour information for efficient and accurate labeling of features in the image. Our approach iterates between an MCMC-based labeling and contour based labeling of features to integrate co-occurrence of features and shape similarity.\nTitle:\nA \"Shape Aware\" Model for semi-supervised Learning of Objects and its Context\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The addition of plugin support in the latest release of GCC makes it an attractive platform for runtime instrumentation, as GCC plug-ins can directly add instrumentation by transforming the compiler's intermediate representation. Such transformations, however, require expert knowledge of GCC internals. INTERASPECT addresses this situation by allowing instrumentation plug-ins to be developed using the familiar vocabulary of Aspect-Oriented Programming pointcuts, join points, and advice functions. INTERASPECT also supports powerful customized instrumentation, where specific information about each join point in a pointcut, as well as results of static analysis, can be used to customize the inserted instrumentation. We introduce the INTERASPECT API and present several examples that illustrate how it can be applied to useful runtime verification problems.\nTitle:\nAspect-oriented instrumentation with GCC\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This paper serves the dual role of describing the GPS system, and presenting techniques and experimental results for graph partitioning in distributed graph-processing systems like GPS. GPS is similar to Google's proprietary Pregel system, with three new features: (1) an extended API to make global computations more easily expressed and more efficient; (2) a dynamic repartitioning scheme that reassigns vertices to different workers during the computation, based on messaging patterns; and (3) an optimization that distributes adjacency lists of high-degree vertices across all compute nodes to improve performance. In addition to presenting the implementation of GPS and its novel features, we also present experimental results on the performance effects of both static and dynamic graph partitioning schemes, and we describe the compilation of a high-level domain-specific programming language to GPS, enabling easy expression of complex algorithms.\nTitle:\nGPS: a graph processing system\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

An image is described by assigning a feature pattern to each pixel, consisting of a scaled family of differential geometrical invariant features. The invariant feature pattern representation of a training image is input to a Kohonen network, in order to obtain a description of the feature space in terms of so-called prototypical feature patterns (the weight vectors of the network). Supervised labeling of these prototypical feature patterns may be accomplished using classes derived from an a priori segmentation of the training image. We can segment any image similar to the training image by comparing the feature pattern representation of each pixel with all weight vectors, and assigning each pixel the class of the best matching weight vector. In our study we evaluated the benefit of applying features at multiple scales, as well as the effects of first and second order information on the results.\nTitle:\nA Multiscale Approach to Image Segmentation Using Kohonen Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) has been shown to be an efficient solution for spatial context modeling. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach, Orientational Pyramid Matching (OPM), for orientational context modeling. Our approach is motivated by the observation that the 3D orientations of objects are a crucial factor to discriminate indoor scenes. The novelty lies in that OPM uses the 3D orientations to form the pyramid and produce the pooling regions, which is unlike SPM that uses the spatial positions to form the pyramid. Experimental results on challenging scene classification tasks show that OPM achieves the performance comparable with SPM and that OPM and SPM make complementary contributions so that their combination gives the state-of-the-art performance.\nTitle:\nOrientational Pyramid Matching for Recognizing Indoor Scenes\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In a large dynamical system, it is often infeasible or even impossible to maintain a model of the whole system. Instead, several incomplete models of the system have to be used to establish a diagnosis and to detect possible faults. These models may also be physically distributed.A Multi-Agent System of diagnostic agents may offer solutions for establishing a global diagnosis. If we use a separate agent for each incomplete model of the system, establishing a global diagnosis becomes a problem of cooperation and negotiation between the diagnostic agents. This raises the question whether `a set of diagnostic agents, each having an incomplete model of the system, can (efficiently) determine the same global diagnosis as an ideal single diagnostic agent having the combined knowledge of these agents?\nTitle:\nAn analysis of multi-agent diagnosis\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we present a comparative study between two strategies for the recognition of multi-font Arabic text. The first strategy is to use a global recognition system working independently on all the fonts. The second strategy is to use a so-called cascade built from a font identification system followed by font-dependent systems. In order to reach a fair comparison, the feature extraction and the modeling algorithms based on HMMs are kept as similar as possible between both approaches. The evaluation is carried out on the large and publicly available APTI (Arabic Printed Text Image) database with 10 different fonts. The results are showing a clear advantage of performance for the cascading approach. However, the cascading system is more costly in terms of cpu and memory.\nTitle:\nComparison of global and cascading recognition systems applied to multi-font arabic text\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In particular, we shall report on characterizations and complexity results for the notions of strong and respectively uniform equivalence. Most notably, uniform equivalence becomes undecidable in the presence of default negation, while strong equivalence remains decidable for full disjunctive datalog.

The technique of post-illumination is introduced to generate new spectral images for arbitrary light colours in real-time. Also a tool is described to design a palette of lights and materials having certain properties such as selective metamerism or colour constancy. Applied to spectral transfer functions, different light colours can accentuate or hide specific qualities of the data.

Given logic programs P 1 , ..., P n , the goal is to provide characterisations of the merging of these programs. Our formal techniques are based on notions of relative distance between the underlying SE models of the logic programs. Two approaches are examined. The first informally selects those models of the programs that vary the least from the models of the other programs. The second approach informally selects those models of a program P 0 that are closest to the models of programs P 1 , ..., P n . P 0 can be thought of as analogous to a set of database integrity constraints. We examine formal properties of these operators and give encodings for computing the mergings of a multiset of logic programs within the same logic programming framework. As a by-product, we provide a complexity analysis revealing that our operators do not increase the complexity of the base formalism.\nTitle:\nMerging Logic Programs under Answer Set Semantics\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

An important aspect of STAIRS is the ability to distinguish between underspecification and inherent nondeterminism through the use of potential and mandatory alternatives. This paper investigates this distinction in more detail. Refinement notions explain when (and how) both kinds of nondeterminism may be reduced during the development process. In particular, in this paper we extend STAIRS with guards, which may be used to specify the choice between alternatives. Finally, we introduce the notion of an implementation and define what it means for an implementation to be correct with respect to a specification.\nTitle:\nRefining UML interactions with underspecification and nondeterminism\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Usually not all valid data objects from the stream can be kept in main memory. Therefore, most existing solutions are approximative. In this paper we propose an efficient method for exact k-NN monitoring. Our method is based on three ideas, (1) selecting exactly those objects from the stream which are able to become the nearest neighbor of one or more continuous queries and storing them in a skyline data structure, (2) delaying to process those objects which are not immediately nearest neighbors of any query, and (3) indexing the queries rather than the streaming objects. In an extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate that our method is applicable on high throughput data streams requiring only very limited storage.\nTitle:\nEfficiently Processing Continuous K-Nn Queries On Data Streams\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this article, we propose a robust framework for determining a natural clustering of a given dataset, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The proposed framework, robust information-theoretic clustering (RIC), is orthogonal to any known clustering algorithm: Given a preliminary clustering, RIC purifies these clusters from noise, and adjusts the clusterings such that it simultaneously determines the most natural amount and shape (subspace) of the clusters. Our RIC method can be combined with any clustering technique ranging from K-means and K-medoids to advanced methods such as spectral clustering. In fact, RIC is even able to purify and improve an initial coarse clustering, even if we start with very simple methods. In an extension, we propose a fully automatic stand-alone clustering method and efficiency improvements. RIC scales well with the dataset size. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed RIC framework.\nTitle:\nRIC: Parameter-free noise-robust clustering\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Nevertheless, current feature modeling notations are limited, representing only propositional formulae over attributed variables. This position paper advocates the extension of feature modeling formalisms with richer computational domains and relational operations. In particular, it proposes to extend feature modeling with finite and continuous domain variables, with first-order logic quantifiers (\u2200, \u2203), and with N-ary relations between features attributes, and with so-called global constraints. In order to extend the expressiveness while preserving automated analysis facilities, feature models could be semantically interpreted as first-order logic formulae (instead of propositional logic formulae), including global and continuous dependency between features. In simpler words, this paper emphasizes the importance of having more relational feature models and presents next-generation applications.\nTitle:\nTowards more relational feature models\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The main reason for this well-known deficit in e-commerce is that, unlike normal business situations, there is no intelligent support or assistance for the user on the Web. This is particularly evident in the selection of products/services or when navigating through the complex space of available product information. Current product-oriented database search facilities are widely used on the Internet but recognised as limited in capability for sales support. In this paper we describe the objectives and achievements of WEBSELL an ESPRIT IV project (7/1998 - 1/2000) that set out to develop the next generation of intelligent sales support technology. WEB SELL draws on techniques from case-based reasoning, decision tree based protocol systems, user profiling and collaborative recommendation to produce virtual sales assistants that elicit users' requirements and identify products or services to meet these requirements.\nTitle:\nWEBSELL: Intelligent Sales Assistants for the World Wide Web\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the OPDP within a context where also numerical attributes are taken into account, which represents a relevant case left open in the literature. As major contributions, we present an efficient parameter-free algorithm to compute the measure of object exceptionality we introduce, and propose a unified framework for mining exceptional properties in the presence of both categorical and numerical attributes.\nTitle:\nOutlying Property Detection with Numerical Attributes.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We present a novel solution to this problem by first reconstructing a 3D model of the object from a low-cost depth sensor such as Kinect, and then searching a database of simulated models in different poses to predict the pose. Given noisy depth images from 360-degree views of the target object acquired from the Kinect sensor, we reconstruct a smooth 3D model of the object using depth image segmentation and volumetric fusion. Then with an efficient feature extraction and matching scheme, we search the database, which contains a large number of deformable objects in different poses, to obtain the most similar model, whose pose is then adopted as the prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate better accuracy and orders of magnitude speed-up compared to our previous work. An additional benefit of our method is that it produces a high-quality mesh model and camera pose, which is necessary for other tasks such as regrasping and object manipulation.\nTitle:\nReal-time pose estimation of deformable objects using a volumetric approach\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We begin our formulation by employing the level set function as the shape descriptor. Next, for each shape class we assume that there exists an unknown underlying level set function whose zero level set describes the contour that best represents the shapes within that shape class. The level set function for each example shape is modeled as a noisy measurement of the appropriate shape class's unknown underlying level set function. Based on this measurement model and the judicious introduction of the class labels as hidden data, our EM formulation calculates the labels for shape classification and estimates the shape contours that best typify the different shape classes. This resulting iterative algorithm is computationally efficient, simple, and accurate. We demonstrate the utility and performance of this algorithm by applying it to two medical applications.\nTitle:\nLevel Set Methods in an EM Framework for Shape Classification and Estimation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Yet, cross-device information transfer -- which should be a common operation -- is surprisingly difficult. One has to know which devices can communicate, what information they contain, and how information can be exchanged. To mitigate this problem, we formulate the gradual engagement design pattern that generalizes prior work in proxemic interactions and informs future system designs. The pattern describes how we can design device interfaces to gradually engage the user by disclosing connectivity and information exchange capabilities as a function of inter-device proximity. These capabilities flow across three stages: (1) awareness of device presence/connectivity, (2) reveal of exchangeable content, and (3) interaction methods for transferring content between devices tuned to particular distances and device capabilities. We illustrate how we can apply this pattern to design, and show how existing and novel interaction techniques for cross-device transfers can be integrated to flow across its various stages. We explore how techniques differ between personal and semi-public devices, and how the pattern supports interaction of multiple users.\nTitle:\nGradual engagement: facilitating information exchange between digital devices as a function of proximity\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Their intended use is wide ranging and encompasses surveillance, transportation, entertainment, education, healthcare, emergency response, disaster recovery, and the like. Technological advances and the low cost of such sensors enable deployment of large-scale camera networks in large metropolises such as London and New York. Multimedia algorithms for analyzing and drawing inferences from video and audio have also matured tremendously in recent times. Despite all these advances, large-scale reliable systems for media-rich sensor-based applications, often classified as situation-awareness applications, are yet to become commonplace. Why is that? There are several forces at work here. First, the system abstractions are just not at the right level for quickly prototyping such applications on a large scale. Second, while Moore's law has held true for predicting the growth of processing power, the volume of data that applications are called upon to handle is growing similarly, if not faster. Enormous amount of sensing data is continually generated for real-time analysis in such applications. Further, due to the very nature of the application domain, there are dynamic and demanding resource requirements for such analyses. The lack of right set of abstractions for programing such applications coupled with their data-intensive nature have hitherto made realizing reliable large-scale situation-awareness applications difficult. Incidentally, situation awareness is a very popular but ill-defined research area that has attracted researchers from many different fields. In this paper, we adopt a strong systems perspective and consider the components that are essential in realizing a fully functional situation-awareness system.\nTitle:\nLarge-Scale Situation Awareness With Camera Networks and Multimodal Sensing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Two high-level goals shape its design. First, to enable a large research community to share the infrastructure, PlanetLab provides distributed virtualization, whereby each service runs in an isolated slice of PlanetLab's global resources. Second, to support competition among multiple network services, PlanetLab decouples the operating system running on each node from the network-wide services that define PlanetLab, a principle referred to as unbundled management. This paper describes how Planet-Lab realizes the goals of distributed virtualization and unbundled management, with a focus on the OS running on each node.\nTitle:\nOperating system support for planetary-scale network services\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This approach uses harmonic estimation to model the periodic nature of cardiac motion. A method for flow vector computation is presented which defines a relationship between image-derived, shape-based correspondences and a more desirable, smoothly varying, set of correspondences. A recursive filter is then constructed which takes into consideration this relationship as well as knowledge of temporal trends. The trajectories of magnetic resonance (MR) contrast markers implanted in the LV wall are compared with trajectories estimated by the filter. The results of this comparison confirm that although cardiac motion is a 3-D problem, 2-D analysis provides a rich testing ground for algorithm development.\nTitle:\nEstimating cardiac motion from image sequences using recursive comb filtering\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We first consider rooted connected cubic planar graphs, i.e., we count connected cubic planar graphs up to isomorphisms that fix a certain directed edge. Based on decompositions along the connectivity structure, we derive recurrence formulas for the exact number of rooted cubic planar graphs. This leads to rooted 3-connected cubic planar graphs, which have a unique embedding on the sphere. Special care has to be taken for rooted graphs that have a sense-reversing automorphism. Therefore we introduce the concept of colored networks, which stand in bijective correspondence to rooted 3-connected cubic planar graphs with given symmetries. Colored networks can again be decomposed along the connectivity structure. For rooted 3-connected cubic planar graphs embedded in the plane, we switch to the dual and count rooted triangulations. Since all these numbers can be evaluated in polynomial time using dynamic programming, rooted connected cubic planar graphs can be generated uniformly at random in polynomial time by inverting the decomposition along the connectivity structure. To generate connected cubic planar graphs without a root uniformly at random, we apply rejection sampling and obtain an expected polynomial time algorithm. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For achieving robustness against collision we use a fitness function based on a non-linearity concept, producing evolved hashes with a good degree of Avalanche Effect. The other main issue, efficiency, is assured by using only very fast operators (both in hardware and software) and by limiting the number of nodes. Using this approach, we have created a new hash function, which we call gp-hash, that is able to outperform a set of five human-generated, widely-used hash functions.\nTitle:\nFinding state-of-the-art non-cryptographic hashes with genetic programming\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To date the two important components in dynamic adaptive streaming, video transcoding which generates the adaptive bitrates of a video and video delivery which streams the videos to users, have been separately studied, resulting in a huge waste of computation and storage resource due to transcoding useless videos and suboptimal streaming quality due to homogeneous video replication. In this paper, we propose to jointly perform video transcoding and video delivery for adaptive streaming in an online manner. We conduct extensive measurement studies of a video sharing system and a CDN to motivate our design. We formulate and solve optimization problems to enable high streaming quality for the users, and low computation and replication costs for the system. In particular, our design connects video transcoding and video delivery based on users' preferences of CDN regions and regional preferences of video versions. Extensive trace-driven experiments further confirm the superiority of our design.\nTitle:\nJoint online transcoding and geo-distributed delivery for dynamic adaptive streaming\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A real-time detection method is hence proposed, which first selects videos' representative frames and then reduces each to a 64 bit hash code. Then the similarity of any two videos can be estimated by the proportion of their similar hash codes.

Assuming the power demand range is known or predictable ahead of time, our proposed distributed algorithm will calculate demand and response of all participating energy demanders and suppliers, as well as energy flow routes, in a fully distributed fashion, such that the social-welfare is optimized. During the computation, each node (e.g., demander or supplier) only needs to exchange limited rounds of messages with its neighboring nodes. It provides a potential scheme for energy trade among participants in the smart grids. Our theoretical analysis proves that the algorithm converges even if there is some random noise induced in the process of our distributed Lagrange-Newton based solution. The simulation also shows that the result is close to that of centralized solution.\nTitle:\nDistributed Demand and Response Algorithm for Optimizing Social-Welfare in Smart Grid\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Consequently, the data processing power of the database system cannot be used anymore for this information, leading to constrained flexibility in the definition of mining patterns and limited execution performance in mining large logs. Enabling process mining directly on a database - instead of via intermediate storage in a flat file - therefore provides additional flexibility and efficiency. To help facilitate this ideal of in-database process mining, this paper formally defines a database operator that extracts the u0027directly followsu0027 relation from an operational database. This operator can both be used to do in-database process mining and to flexibly evaluate process mining related queries, such as:  employee most frequently changes the u0027amountu0027 attribute of a case from one task to the next. We define the operator using the well-known relational algebra that forms the formal underpinning of relational databases. We formally prove equivalence properties of the operator that are useful for query optimization and present time-complexity properties of the operator. By doing so this paper formally defines the necessary relational algebraic elements of a u0027directly followsu0027 operator, which are required for implementation of such an operator in a DBMS.\nTitle:\nRelational Algebra for In-Database Process Mining.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Mobile devices, including smartphones, laptops and PDAs, associate with nearby access points that are located on the roadside to access Internet in VANETs. Hence, people can use these devices to communicate in VANETs. However, the unbalanced traffic distribution often occurs among the APs in the networks, which leads to unfair bandwidth share for each user. This situation may get worse in VANETs composed of thousands of high mobility vehicles. Hence, this study focuses on association control to achieve load balancing among APs RSUs, and we propose a novel association control algorithm with an aid of the navigation system. Based on the use of fully-fledged navigation system, our proposed algorithm plans a RSU-association-schedule, which selects a series of appropriate RSUs roadside units in advance to reach destination and meanwhile achieves load balancing among RSUs. The simulation results show that our scheme does improve the fairness and overall performance in VANETs.\nTitle:\nNavigation-aware association control in vehicular wireless networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Usually, Markov chains of various kinds serve as the core mathematical formalism in these studies. However, in many of these settings, the probabilistic graphical model called dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) [4] can be amore appropriate model to work with. This is so since a DBN is often a factored and succinct representation of an underlying Markov chain. Our goal here is to describe DBNs from this standpoint. After introducing the basic formalism, we discuss inferencing algorithms for DBNs. We then consider a simple probabilistic temporal logic and the associated model checking problem for DBNs with a finite time horizon. Finally, we describe how DBNs can be used to study the behavior of biochemical networks.\nTitle:\nDynamic bayesian networks: a factored model of probabilistic dynamics\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

State-of-the-art face tracking methods in the VR context are focused on the animation of rigged 3D avatars (Li et al. 2015; Olszewski et al. 2016). Although they achieve good tracking performance, the results look cartoonish and not real. In contrast to these model-based approaches, FaceVR enables VR teleconferencing using an image-based technique that results in nearly photo-realistic outputs. The key component of FaceVR is a robust algorithm to perform real-time facial motion capture of an actor who is wearing a head-mounted display (HMD), as well as a new data-driven approach for eye tracking from monocular videos. Based on reenactment of a prerecorded stereo video of the person without the HMD, FaceVR incorporates photo-realistic re-rendering in real time, thus allowing artificial modifications of face and eye appearances. For instance, we can alter facial expressions or change gaze directions in the prerecorded target video. In a live setup, we apply these newly introduced algorithmic components.\n\n\nTitle:\nFaceVR: Real-Time Gaze-Aware Facial Reenactment in Virtual Reality.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Like standard secure two-party computation, covert two-party computation allows Alice and Bob, with secret inputs xA and xB respectively, to compute a function f(xA,xB) without leaking any additional information about their inputs. In addition, covert two-party computation guarantees that even the existence of a computation is hidden from all protocol participants unless the value of the function mandates otherwise. This allows the construction of protocols that return f(xA,xB) only when it equals a certain value of interest (such as \"Yes, we are romantically interested in each other\") but for which neither party can determine whether the other even ran the protocol whenever f(xA,xB) is not a value of interest. Since existing techniques for secure function evaluation always reveal that both parties participate in the computation, covert computation requires the introduction of new techniques based on provably secure steganography. We introduce security definitions for covert two-party computation and show that this surprising notion can be achieved by a protocol given the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in the \"honest but curious\" model. Using this protocol as a subroutine, we present another protocol which is fair and secure against malicious adversaries in the Random Oracle Model --- unlike most other protocols against malicious adversaries, this protocol does not rely on zero-knowledge proofs (or similar cut-and-choose techniques), because they inherently reveal that a computation took place. We remark that all our protocols are of comparable efficiency to protocols for standard secure two-party computation.\nTitle:\nCovert two-party computation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, several popular image partition methods are investigated for adaptive image categorization based on structural representation. Experimental results on seven categories of scenery images show that both the structure and node attributes are important to categorize image contents.

Watermark detection is blind that does not require an original image and it is invisible to avoid revealing secret information to malicious attackers.

Decentralized Information Flow Control (DIFC) [10] provides an effective means for preserving user privacy. In a traditional setup where the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs on top of an Operating System (OS), sensitive information flows both through the JVM and the OS, and effective enforcement of information flow policies requires tracking data across both these entities [12].

The aim is to present this research field, which has a long-term tradition, and discuss about its future. The first question to answer is \"What? What are declarative agents and multi-agent systems?\". Therefore, we will introduce the history of declarative agent systems up to the state of the art by answering the question \"When? When did research on them begin?\". We will, then, move to the question \"Where? Where can it take place?\": in which kind of real applications and for which kind of problems declarative agents and MAS have already proven useful? Connected to where is \"Why? Why should it happen?\". We will discuss the benefits of adopting the abstractions offered by declarative approaches for developing communication, interaction, cooperation mechanisms.We will compare with other technologies, mainly service-based and object-oriented ones. \"Who? Who can be involved?\": in order to exploit this kind of technology what sort of background does a specialist have to acquire? We address this question by looking at the Italian landscape of Computer Science research and education. Finally, with the question \"How? How can it happen?\" we will shortly report some examples of existing declarative languages and frameworks for the specification, verification, implementation and prototyping of agents and MAS.\nTitle:\nAgents, multi-agent systems and declarative programming: what, when, where, why, who, how?\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, these techniques have not been thoroughly compared to simpler techniques such as random testing. We present the results of a larger case study in which we compare random testing with shape abstraction, a systematic technique that showed the best results in a previous study. Our experiments show that random testing is about as effective as shape abstraction for testing these containers, which raises the question whether containers are well suited as a benchmark for comparing advanced testing techniques.\nTitle:\nTesting container classes: random or systematic?\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It is believed that, in many cases, good approximations for combinatorial auctions may be unattainable due to an inherent clash between truthfulness and computational efficiency. In this paper, we prove the first computational-complexity in-approximability results for incentive-compatible mechanisms for combinatorial auctions. Our results are tight, hold for the important class of VCG-based mechanisms, and are based on the complexity assumption that NP has no polynomial-size circuits. We show two different techniques to obtain such lower bounds: one for deterministic mechanisms that attains optimal dependence on the number of players and number of items, and one that also applies to a class of randomized mechanisms and attains optimal dependence on the number of players. Both techniques are based on novel VC dimension machinery.\nTitle:\nInapproximability for VCG-based combinatorial auctions\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this work, we study propagation of cell-phone worms, which exploit Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and/or Bluetooth for spreading. We then propose a systematic countermeasure against the worms. At the terminal level, we adopt Graphic Turing test and identity-based signature to block unauthorized messages from leaving compromised phones; at the network level, we propose a push-based automated patching scheme for cleansing compromised phones. Through experiments on phone devices and a wide variety of networks, we show that cellular systems taking advantage of our defense can achieve a low infection rate (e.g., less than 3% within 30 hours) even under severe attacks.\nTitle:\nA systematic approach for cell-phone worm containment\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In the database theory community, most efforts have been focused on studying worst-optimal algorithms. However, the worst-case optimality of these join algorithms relies on the hard instances having very large output sizes. In the case of a two-relation join, the hard instance is just a Cartesian product, with an output size that is quadratic in the input size. In practice, however, the output size is usually much smaller. One recent parallel join algorithm by Beame et al.[8] has achieved output-optimality, i.e., its cost is optimal in terms of both the input size and the output size, but their algorithm only works for a 2-relation equi-join, and has some imperfections. In this paper, we first improve their algorithm to true optimality. Then we design output-optimal algorithms for a large class of similarity joins. Finally, we present a lower bound, which essentially eliminates the possibility of having output-optimal algorithms for any join on more than two relations.\nTitle:\nOutput-optimal Parallel Algorithms for Similarity Joins.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The number and complexity of such ontologies make hard to ontology and tool developers to select which ontologies to use and reuse. So far, there are no mechanism for making such decisions in an informed manner. Consequently, methods for evaluating ontology quality are required. OQuaRE is a method for ontology quality evaluation which adapts the SQuaRE standard for software product quality to ontologies. OQuaRE has been applied to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different ontologies but, so far, this framework has not been evaluated itself. Therefore, in this paper we present the evaluation of OQuaRE, performed by an international panel of experts in ontology engineering. The results include the positive and negative aspects of the current version of OQuaRE, the completeness and utility of the quality metrics included in OQuaRE and the comparison between the results of the manual evaluations done by the experts and the ones obtained by a software implementation of OQuaRE.\nTitle:\nEvaluation of the OQuaRE framework for ontology quality\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Precisely, their main objective is to categorize data into clusters such that objects are grouped in the same cluster when they are similar according to specific metrics. There is a wide and diverse body of knowledge in the area of clustering and there has been attempts apply these algorithms and scale it to adopt todays data. However, one major challenge in using clustering algorithms is scalability of such algorithms in a way that faces the challenges and computational cost of clustering big data. In this paper, we are describing a mapping between graph clustering problem and data clustering. Using genetic algorithms and multi-objective optimization as well as distributed graph stores, the proposed algorithm (1) transform big data into Distributed RDF graphs. With (2) a novel distributed encoding techniques. The algorithm (3) scales to deal with big RDF graphs to (4) produce clusters by maximizing graph modularity as a main objective. The results on LUBM generated big data shows the (5) ability to deal with the challenges provided such data and (6) produce comparative results compared to other peers of clustering algorithms.\nTitle:\nDistributed genetic algorithm to big data clustering\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

PADUA is applied to a typical problem in the classification of routine claims for a hypothetical welfare benefit. We particularly address the problems that arise from the extensive number of misclassified examples typically found in such domains, where the high error rate is a widely recognised problem. We give examples of the use of PADUA in this domain, and explore in particular the effect of intermediate predicates.

Nevertheless, reproducing a delicious dish that one has never encountered before is not easy. Even if the name of dish is known and the corresponding recipe could be retrieved, the right ingredients for cooking the dish may not be available due to factors such as geography region or season. Furthermore, knowing how to cut, cook and control timing may be challenging for one whose has no cooking experience. In this paper, an all-around cooking assistant mobile app, named Pic2Dish, is developed to help users who would like to cook a dish but neither know the name of dish nor has cooking skill. Basically, by inputting a picture of the dish and the list of ingredients at hand, Pic2Dish automatically recognizes the dish name and recommends a customized recipe together with video clips to guide user on how to cook the dish. Importantly, the recommended recipe is modified from a retrieved recipe that best matches the given dish, with missing ingredients being replaced with the available ingredients that match dish context and taste. The whole process involves the recognition of dishes with convolutional neural network, classification of key and non-key ingredients, and context analysis of ingredient relationship and their cooking/cutting methods. The user studies, which recruit real users to cook dishes by using Pic2Dish, shows the usefulness of the app.\n\n\nTitle:\nPIC2DISH: A Customized Cooking Assistant System.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The first criterion is to minimize a ring cost, related to the length of the cycle, whereas the second one is to minimize an assignment cost, from non-visited nodes to visited ones. In spite of its natural multi-objective formulation, this problem has never been investigated in such a way. In this paper, three metaheuristics are designed to approximate the whole set of efficient solutions for the problem under consideration.

Taxonomy is one of the keys to understanding the security threats that the Internet is facing today and the countermeasure approaches that should be devised in order to keep the Internet as secure as possible. In this paper, we propose a novel Internet security taxonomy. This taxonomy is based on a mapping of today's Internet security services against the corresponding security attacks and countermeasures. An assessment of the performance of the proposed taxonomy is also discussed.\nTitle:\nComprehensive Approach To Designing Internet Security Taxonomy\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Deformable models (DM) and graphical models (GM) are two important categories of optimization based image segmentation methods. Efforts have been made on integrating two types of models into one framework. However, previous methods are not designed for segmenting multiple organs simultaneously and accurately. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi organ segmentation approach by integrating DM and GM in a coupled optimization framework. Specifically, we show that region-based deformable models can be integrated with Markov Random Fields (MRF), such that multiple models' evolutions are driven by a maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. It brings global and local deformation constraints into a unified framework for simultaneous segmentation of multiple objects in an image. We validate this proposed method on two challenging problems of multi organ segmentation, and the results are promising.\nTitle:\nCollaborative Multi Organ Segmentation by Integrating Deformable and Graphical Models.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This paper reports on a detailed analysis of the performance overhead in Open MPI introduced by the MCA. We compare the MCA-based implementation of Open MPI with a modified version that bypasses the component infrastructure. The overhead of the MCA is shown to be low, on the order of 1%, for both latency and bandwidth microbenchmarks as well as for the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite.\nTitle:\nAnalysis of the component architecture overhead in open MPI\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Graphical visualization of these performance indices helps to identify the primary system bottleneck in each configuration studied.The Apache Web server is used as a case study to demonstrate the methodology.

We consider the tradeoffs between two versions of a UI for working with data on a touch tablet. One interface is based on using the conventional desktop metaphor (WIMP) with a control panel, push buttons, and checkboxes -- where the mouse click is effectively replaced by a finger tap. The other interface (which we call FLUID) eliminates the control panel and focuses touch actions on the data visualization itself. We describe our design process and evaluation of each interface. We discuss the significantly better task performance and preference for the FLUID interface, in particular how touch design may challenge certain assumptions about the performance benefits of WIMP interfaces that do not hold on touch devices, such as the superiority of gestural vs. control panel based interaction.\nTitle:\nTouchViz: a case study comparing two interfaces for data analytics on tablets\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

These technologies are expected to provide a wide variety of real-time applications; hence, there is a vital need to provide quality-of-Service (QoS) support. One of the key mechanisms to support QoS is traffic regulation. The basic idea behind traffic regulation is to measure the network state (e.g., load) in order to adapt the rate of carefully selected application flows. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called FuzzyWMN, which can be used to implement traffic adaptation in Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs).The objective of FuzzyWMN is to compute the rate adaptation to apply to application flows according to the current network state; it relies on two parameters to meet this objective: (1) packet delays between sources and destinations; and (2) buffer occupancy of network nodes. The proposed model combines the essential notions of both fuzzy logic theory and Petri nets; this enables FuzzyWMN to realize traffic adaptation in networks characterized by information uncertainty and imprecision due to the dynamic traffic behavior, channel interferences, etc. Extensive simulations show that FuzzyWMN achieves stable end-to-end delay and good throughput under different network conditions.\nTitle:\nToward Fuzzy Traffic Adaptation Solution in Wireless Mesh Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Although a large body of research work has dealt with Android malware over the last years, none has addressed it from a forensic point of view. After collecting over 500,000 applications from user markets and research repositories, we perform an analysis that yields precious insights on the writing process of Android malware. This study also explores some strange artifacts in the datasets, and the divergent capabilities of state-of-the-art antivirus to recognize/define malware. We further highlight some major weak usage and misunderstanding of Android security by the criminal community and show some patterns in their operational flow. Finally, using insights from this analysis, we build a naive malware detection scheme that could complement existing anti virus software.\nTitle:\nA Forensic Analysis of Android Malware -- How is Malware Written and How it Could Be Detected?\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Semi-supervised clustering is a new technique that uses known and labeled data in order to assist a clustering process. We propose two different fingerprinting approaches.

The main purpose of this workshop was to share and pool the collective experience of people, both academics and practitioners, who are actively working on software engineering for large-scale multi-agent systems. The call for papers elicited some 24 submissions, of which 14 papers were accepted for presentation. A set of selected workshop and invited papers are to appear in a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS, Springer) volume. The workshop consisted of an opening presentation, two keynote talks, four technical sessions of paper presentations, and two panels. During the workshop we informally reviewed ongoing and previous work and debated a number of important issues. The SELMAS 2004 website can be found at . We begin by presenting an overview of our goals and the workshop structure, and then focus on the workshop technical program.\nTitle:\nSoftware engineering for large-scale multi-agent systems - SELMAS 2004: workshop report\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our visualization tool RelEx was created and iteratively refined through a full user-centered design process that included a full problem characterization phase before tool design began, paper prototyping, iterative refinement in close collaboration with expert users for formative evaluation, deployment in the field with real analysts using their own data, usability testing with non-expert users, and summative evaluation at the end of the deployment. In the summative post-deployment study, which entailed domain experts using the tool over several weeks in their daily practice, we documented many examples where the use of RelEx simplified or sped up their work compared to previous practices.\nTitle:\nRelEx: Visualization for Actively Changing Overlay Network Specifications\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The objective function is based on the assumption that the underlying noise model for the line correspondences is the Fisher distribution. The assumption is appropriate for 3D orientation, is different from the underlying noise models for k pixels positions, and allows us to do a consistent estimation of the unknown parameters. The objective function gives two important facts: its formulation and concept is different for that of previous work, and it automatically estimates six unknown parameters simultaneously. As a result, it provides an optimal solution and better accuracy. We design an experimental protocol to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm. The results of each experiment shows that the new algorithm produces answers whose errors are 10%\u201320% less than the competing decoupled least squares algorithm.\nTitle:\nStatistical Estimation for Exterior Orientation from Line-to-Line Correspondences\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Among the tasks addressed are: source discovery, query interface extraction, schema matching, etc. There are also a number of tasks that are commonly ignored or assumed to be apriori solved either manually or by some oracle. These tasks include (1) finding the set of stop words and (2) handling occurrences of \"semantic enrichment words\" within labels. These two subproblems have a direct impact on determining the synonymy and hyponymy relationships between labels. In (1), a word like \"from\" is a stop word in general but it is a content word in domains such as Airline and Real Estate. We formulate the stop word problem, prove its complexity and provide an approximation algorithm. In (2), we study the impact of words like AND and OR on establishing semantic relationships between labels (e.g. \"departure date and time\" is a hypernym of \"departure date\"). In addition, we develop a theoretical framework to differentiate synonymy relationship from hyponymy relationship among labels involving multiple words. We scrutinize its strength and limitations both analytically and experimentally. We use real data from the Web in our experiments. We analyze over 2300 labels of 220 user interfaces in 9 distinct domains.\nTitle:\nStop word and related problems in web interface integration\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Various link-based features of web pages have been introduced and have proven effective at identifying link spam. One particularly successful family of features (as described in the SpamRank algorithm), is based on examining the sets of pages that contribute most to the PageRank of a given vertex, called supporting sets. In a recent paper, the current authors described an algorithm for efficiently computing, for a single specified vertex, an approximation of its supporting sets. In this paper, we describe several link-based spam-detection features, both supervised and unsupervised, that can be derived from these approximate supporting sets. In particular, we examine the size of a node's supporting sets and the approximate l2 norm of the PageRank contributions from other nodes. As a supervised feature, we examine the composition of a node's supporting sets. We perform experiments on two labeled real data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of these features for spam detection, and demonstrate that these features can be computed efficiently. Furthermore, we design a variation of PageRank (called Robust PageRank) that incorporates some of these features into its ranking, argue that this variation is more robust against link spam engineering, and give an algorithm for approximating Robust PageRank.\nTitle:\nRobust PageRank and locally computable spam detection features\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The effective resistance comes up in many applications and fields in addition to electrical network analysis, including, for example, Markov chains and continuous-time averaging networks. In this paper we study the problem of allocating edge weights on a given graph in order to minimize the total effective resistance, i.e., the sum of the resistances between all pairs of nodes. We show that this is a convex optimization problem and can be solved efficiently either numerically or, in some cases, analytically. We show that optimal allocation of the edge weights can reduce the total effective resistance of the graph (compared to uniform weights) by a factor that grows unboundedly with the size of the graph. We show that among all graphs with $n$ nodes, the path has the largest value of optimal total effective resistance and the complete graph has the least.\nTitle:\nMinimizing Effective Resistance of a Graph.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Tps can be called from mega either as a black box or as an interactive system. In black box mode, the user has control over the parameters which control proof search in Tps; in interactive mode, all features of the Tps-system are avail-able to the user. If the subproblem which is passed to Tps contains concepts de ned in mega's database of mathematical theories, these de nitions are not instantiated but are also passed to Tps. Using a special theory which contains proof tactics that model the ND-calculus variant of Tps within mega, any complete or partial proof generated in Tps can be translated one to one into an mega proof plan. Proof transformation is realised by proof plan expansion in mega's 3-dimensional proof data structure, and remains transparent to the user. \nTitle:\nIntegrating Tps and Omega\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In order to provide for this experimentation, we have investigated the creation of a software testbed and the feasibility of using the same testbed for experimenting with a broad set of technologies. The testbed is a set of programs, data, and supporting documentation that allows researchers to test their new technology on a standard software platform. An important component of this testbed is the Unified Model of Dependability (UMD), which was used to elicit dependability requirements for the testbed software. With a collection of seeded faults and known issues of the target system, we are able to determine if a new technology is adept at uncovering defects or providing other aids proposed by its developers. In this paper, we present the Tactical Separation Assisted Flight Environment (TSAFE) testbed environment for which we modeled and evaluated dependability requirements and defined faults to be seeded for experimentation. We describe two completed experiments that we conducted on the testbed. The first experiment studies a technology that identifies architectural violations and evaluates its ability to detect the violations. The second experiment studies model checking as part of design for verification. We conclude by describing ongoing experimental work studying testing, using the same testbed. Our conclusion is that even though these three experiments are very different in terms of the studied technology, using and re-using the same testbed is beneficial and cost effective.\nTitle:\nExperimenting with software testbeds for evaluating new technologies\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Conventional distance metric learning approaches often assume that the target distance function is represented in some form of Mahalanobis distance. These approaches usually work well when data are in low dimensionality, but often become computationally expensive or even infeasible when handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme of learning nonlinear distance functions with side information. It aims to learn a Bregman distance function using a nonparametric approach that is similar to Support Vector Machines. We emphasize that the proposed scheme is more general than the conventional approach for distance metric learning, and is able to handle high-dimensional data efficiently. We verify the efficacy of the proposed distance learning method with extensive experiments on semi-supervised clustering. The comparison with state-of-the-art approaches for learning distance functions with side information reveals clear advantages of the proposed technique.\nTitle:\nLearning Bregman Distance Functions for Semi-Supervised Clustering\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Proving and solving equations and inequations may also constitute subtasks in constraint logic programming. In this paper, we give forward (i.e., nonrefutational) techniques for proving the negation of equality in a theory. We develop a complete inference system to check whether an inequation is a logical consequence of a given system of equations and inequations. The inference system is used to develop a goal-directed semidecision procedure which uses a narrowing technique for proving inequations. A decision procedure is obtained when certain additional conditions are satisfied. The semidecision procedure for proving inequations is also modified to obtain a semidecision procedure for solving inequations in a theory, i.e., finding a substitution such that the corresponding instance of the given inequation is a logical consequence of the given system.\nTitle:\nInference rules and proof procedures for inequations\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

DTNs rely on the inherent mobility in the network to deliver packets around frequent and extended network partitions using a store-carry-and-forward paradigm. However, missed contact opportunities decrease throughput and increase delay in the network. We propose the use of throwboxes in mobile DTNs to create a greater number of contact opportunities, consequently improving the performance of the network. Throwboxes are wireless nodes that act as relays, creating additional contact opportunities in the DTN. We propose algorithms to deploy stationary throwboxes in the network that simultaneously consider routing as well as placement. We also present placement algorithms that use more limited knowledge about the network structure. We perform an extensive evaluation of our algorithms by varying both the underlying routing and mobility models. Our results suggest several findings to guide the design and operation of throwbox-augmented DTNs\nTitle:\nCapacity Enhancement using Throwboxes in DTNs\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For this reason, mechanisms in which agents exchange potential agreements according to various rules of interaction have become very popular in recent years as evident, for example, in the auction and mechanism design community. However, a growing body of research is now emerging which points out limitations in such mechanisms and advocates the idea that agents can increase the likelihood and quality of an agreement by exchanging arguments which influence each others' states. This community further argues that argument exchange is sometimes essential when various assumptions about agent rationality cannot be satisfied. To this end, in this article, we identify the main research motivations and ambitions behind work in the field. We then provide a conceptual framework through which we outline the core elements and features required by agents engaged in argumentation-based negotiation, as well as the environment that hosts these agents. For each of these elements, we survey and evaluate existing proposed techniques in the literature and highlight the major challenges that need to be addressed if argument-based negotiation research is to reach its full potential.\nTitle:\nArgumentation-based negotiation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

People use many behavioural cues to infer others' intentions, such as deliberative actions, facial expressions, eye gaze, and gestures. In artificial intelligence, two approaches for intention recognition, among others, are gaze-based and model-based intention recognition. Approaches in the former class use gaze to determine which parts of a space a person looks at more often to infer a person's intention. Approaches in the latter use models of possible future behaviour to rate intentions as more likely if they are a better 'fit' to observed actions. In this paper, we propose a novel model of human intention recognition that combines gaze and model-based approaches for online human intention recognition. Gaze data is used to build probability distributions over a set of possible intentions, which are then used as priors in a model-based intention recognition algorithm. In human behavioural experiments (n = 20) involving a multi-player board game, we found that adding gaze-based priors to model-based intention recognition more accurately determined intentions (p < 0.01), determined those intentions earlier (p < 0.01), and at no additional cost; all compared to a model-based-only approach.\nTitle:\nCombining Planning With Gaze For Online Human Intention Recognition\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

VoxNet is a complete hardware and software platform for distributed acoustic monitoring applications that focuses on three key goals:(1) rapid deployment in realistic environments;(2) a high level programming language that abstracts the user from platform and network details and compiles into a high performance distributed application; and(3) an interactive usage model based on run-time installable programs, with the ability to run the same high level program seamlessly over live or stored data. The VoxNet hardware is self-contained and weather-resistant, and supports a four-channel microphone array with automated time synchronization, localization, and network coordination. Using VoxNet, an investigator can visualize phenomena in real-time, develop and tune on-line analysis, and record raw data for off-line analysis and archival. This paper describes both the hardware and software elements of the platform, as well as the architecture required to support distributed programs running over a heterogeneous network.We characterize the performance of the platform, using both microbenchmarks that evaluate specific aspects of the platform and a real application running in the field.\nTitle:\nVoxNet: An Interactive, Rapidly-Deployable Acoustic Monitoring Platform\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The evaluation function of the program is evolved by learning from databases of (human) grandmaster games. At first, the organisms are evolved to mimic the behavior of human grandmasters, and then these organisms are further improved upon by means of coevolution. The search mechanism is evolved by learning from tactical test suites.

They deliver a solution of acceptable quality in reasonable time in many cases. When theoretically analysing the performance of randomised search heuristics one usually considers the average time needed to find an optimal solution or one of a pre-specified approximation quality. This is very different from practice where usually the algorithm is stopped after some time. For a theoretical analysis this corresponds to investigating the quality of the solution obtained after a pre-specified number of function evaluations called budget. Such a perspective is taken here and two simple randomised search heuristics, random local search and the (1+1) evolutionary algorithm, are analysed on simple and well-known example functions. If the budget is significantly smaller than the expected time needed for optimisation the behaviour of the algorithms can be very different depending on the problem at hand. Precise analytical results are proven. They demonstrate novel and interesting challenges in the analysis of randomised search heuristics. The potential of this different perspective to provide a more practically useful theory is shown.\nTitle:\nFixed budget computations: a different perspective on run time analysis\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

With the advances of compression, storage and network technologies, Video on Demand (VoD) service is becoming more and more popular. However, it is difficult for conventional systems to meet the continuous and heterogeneous requirements from service providers and users simultaneously. This paper introduces an autonomous decentralized VoD system sustained by mobile agents for information service provision and utilization. Under the proposed architecture, autonomous fault detection and recovery technologies are proposed to assure continuous service. The effectiveness of the proposed technology is proved by the simulation. The results show that an average of 30\\% improvement in recovery time and users' video service can be recovered without stopping compared with the conventional system.\nTitle:\nAutonomous Decentralized VoD System Architecture and Fault-Tolerant Technology to Assure Continuous Service\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For example, prompting systems can help keep people with cognitive disabilities on track and surveillance systems can warn of activities of concern. Current automatic systems are difficult to deploy because they cannot identify novel activities, and, instead, must be trained in advance to recognize important activities. Identifying and labeling these events is time consuming and thus not suitable for real-time support of already-deployed activity recognition systems. In this paper, we introduce Legion:AR, a system that provides robust, deployable activity recognition by supplementing existing recognition systems with on-demand, real-time activity identification using input from the crowd. Legion:AR uses activity labels collected from crowd workers to train an automatic activity recognition system online to automatically recognize future occurrences. To enable the crowd to keep up with real-time activities, Legion:AR intelligently merges input from multiple workers into a single ordered label set. We validate Legion:AR across multiple domains and crowds and discuss features that allow appropriate privacy and accuracy tradeoffs.\nTitle:\nReal-time crowd labeling for deployable activity recognition\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This paper focuses on rolling upgrade of software versions in virtual machine instances on cloud computing platforms, when various failures may occur. An operator can choose the number of instances that are updated in one round and system environments to minimise completion time, availability degradation, and monetary cost for entire rolling upgrade, and hence this is a multi-objective optimisation problem. To predict completion time in the presence of failures, we offer a stochastic model that represents the dynamics of rolling upgrade. To reduce the computational effort of decision making for large scale complex systems, we propose a technique that can find a Pareto set quickly via an upper bound of the expected completion time. Then an optimum of the original problem can be chosen from this set of potential solutions. We validate our approach to minimise the objectives, through both experiments in Amazon Web Service (AWS) and simulations.\nTitle:\nMulti-objective Optimisation of Rolling Upgrade Allowing for Failures in Clouds\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The data collected by the tool provided the benchmark against which errors and oversights in the manual data collection of these two features could be recorded. Results showed our initial hypotheses to be refuted - manual errors in data collection from the four Java systems arose not from the presence of inner classes or from class size but from variations in coding style, lack of standards, class layout and disparateness of class feature declarations.\nTitle:\nIs Manual Data Collection Hampered by the Presence of Inner Classes or Class Size?\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Image registration aims to find the correspondence, while modelling requires it. This paper presents the theoretical framework required to unify these two areas, providing a groupwise registration algorithm, where the inherently groupwise model of the image data becomes an integral part of the registration process. The performance of this algorithm is evaluated by extending the concepts of generalisability and specificity from shape models to image models. This provides an independent metric for comparing registration algorithms of groups of images. Experimental results on MR data of brains for various pairwise and groupwise registration algorithms is presented, and demonstrates the feasibility of the combined registration/modelling framework, as well as providing quantitative evidence for the superiority of groupwise approaches to registration.\nTitle:\nA unified information-theoretic approach to groupwise non-rigid registration and model building\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, building a system that can adapt to arbitrary objects and a wide range of lighting conditions is a challenging problem, especially if hard real-time constraints apply like in robotics scenarios. In this work, we introduce a method for learning a discriminative object tracking system based on the recent structured regression framework for object localization. Using a kernel function that allows fast evaluation on the GPU, the resulting system can process video streams at speed of 100 frames per second or more. Consecutive frames in high speed video sequences are typically very redundant, and for training an object detection system, it is sufficient to have training labels from only a subset of all images. We propose an active learning method that select training examples in a data-driven way, thereby minimizing the required number of training labeling. Experiments on realistic data show that the active learning is superior to previously used methods for dataset subsampling for this task.\nTitle:\nActive Structured Learning for High-Speed Object Detection\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Blast implements a lazy-abstraction algorithm, which integrates automatic abstraction refinement and model checking [8]. The input to Blast is a C program and a safety monitor written in a specification language with C like syntax [1]. The lazy-abstraction algorithm returns either an error trace of the program together with a corresponding test case [2], or a proof that the program satisfies the safety property [6] (or, since the problem is undecidable, the algorithm may fail to terminate). Blast automatically constructs and refines a parsimonious predicate abstraction of the input program, using an interpolation-based decision procedure to find, based on counterexample analysis, the relevant predicates for each individual control location [5]. Blast has successfully verified and found violations of interface safety properties of large device driver programs [6,5], memory safety properties [3], race conditions in nesC programs (using an extension for concurrent programs) [4], and file handling properties of large open-source programs [9].

Unfortunately, it is only appropriate for sequentially consistent memory models, while the hardware and software platforms that algorithms run on provide weaker consistency guarantees. In this paper, we present the first definition of linearizability on a weak memory model, Total Store Order (TSO), implemented by x86 processors. We establish that our definition is a correct one in the following sense: while proving a property of a client of a concurrent library, we can soundly replace the library by its abstract implementation related to the original one by our generalisation of linearizability. This allows abstracting from the details of the library implementation while reasoning about the client.

The images for a given keyword are typically highly variable, with a large fraction being unrelated to the query term, and thus pose a challenging environment from which to learn. By training our models directly from Internet images, we remove the need to laboriously compile training data sets, required by most other recognition approaches-this opens up the possibility of learning object category models \u201con-the-fly.\u201d We describe two simple approaches, derived from the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) technique for text document analysis, that can be used to automatically learn object models from these data. We show two applications of the learned model: first, to rerank the images returned by the search engine, thus improving the quality of the search engine; and second, to recognize objects in other image data sets.\nTitle:\nLearning Object Categories From Internet Image Searches\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Understanding the firing patterns of neurons implicit in these spike trains is crucial to gaining insight into cellular activity.

We focus on mining frequent episodes of firing patterns that capture coordinated events even in the presence of intervening background events. We present two algorithmic strategies\u2014hybrid mining and two-pass elimination\u2014to map the finite state machine-based counting algorithms onto GPUs. These strategies explore different computation-to-core mapping schemes and illustrate innovative parallel algorithm design patterns for temporal data mining. We also provide a multi-GPU mining framework, which exhibits additional performance enhancement.

The atlas encodes functional connectivity structure in a low-dimensional embedding space that is derived from a diffusion process on a graph that represents correlations of fMRI time courses. The functional atlas is decoupled from the anatomical space, and thus can represent functional networks with variable spatial distribution in a population. In practice the atlas is represented by a common prior distribution for the embedded fMRI signals of all subjects. We derive an algorithm for fitting this generative model to the observed data in a population. Our results in a language fMRI study demonstrate that the method identifies coherent and functionally equivalent regions across subjects. The method also successfully maps functional networks from a healthy population used as a training set to individuals whose language networks are affected by tumors.\nTitle:\nDecoupling function and anatomy in atlases of functional connectivity patterns: Language mapping in tumor patients.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Previous work has demonstrated considerable success in developing an automatic breast tissue classification methodology which overcomes this difficulty. This paper proposes a unified approach for the application of a number of rough and fuzzy-rough set methods to the analysis of mammographic data. Indeed this is the first time that fuzzy-rough approaches have been applied to this particular problem domain. In the unified approach detailed here feature selection methods are employed for dimensionality reduction developed using rough sets and fuzzy-rough sets. A number of classifiers are then used to examine the data reduced by the feature selection approaches and assess the positive impact of these methods on classification accuracy. Additionally, this paper also employs a new fuzzy-rough classifier based on the nearest neighbour classification algorithm. The novel use of such an approach demonstrates its efficiency in improving classification accuracy for mammographic data, as well as considerably removing redundant, irrelevant, and noisy features. This is supported with experimental application to two well-known datasets. The overall result of employing the proposed unified approach is that feature selection can identify only those features which require extraction. This can have the positive effect of increasing the risk assessment accuracy rate whilst additionally reducing the time required for expert scrutiny, which in-turn means the risk analysis process is potentially quicker and involves less screening.\nTitle:\nFuzzy-rough approaches for mammographic risk analysis\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It handles the combinatorial structure of matchings directly and needs to only know weights of appropriately defined matchings from algebraic subroutines.Moreover, using novel planarity preserving reductions, we show how to find: maximum weight matching in G when G is bipartite; maximum multiple-source multiple-sink flow in G where c:E -u003e [1, poly(n)] is a polynomially bounded edge capacity function; minimum weight f-factor in G where f:V -u003e [1, poly(n)]; min-cost flow in G where c:E -u003e [1, poly(n)] is a polynomially bounded edge capacity function and b:V -u003e [1, poly(n)] is a polynomially bounded vertex demand function.

We show that the hypercube networks are strongly fault-tolerant and develop an algorithm that constructs the maximum number of node-disjoint paths in a hypercube network with faults.

Instead of simply using the best action output by the classifier, we determine the best action by looking into possible sequences of future actions and evaluating the final states realized by those action sequences. We present a perceptron-based parameter optimization method for this learning framework and show its convergence properties. The proposed framework is evaluated on part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition and dependency parsing, using standard data sets and features.

Due to the existence of the CSI delay and channel estimation error in practical systems, CSI is always imperfect, which degrades system performance significantly. In this paper, by using the correlation between the actual channel and the estimated one as well as the channel's time-correlation, we develop a novel bit error rate (BER) expression for M-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) signal in time division duplex (TDD) downlink MU-MIMO system with channel estimation error and CSI delay. We find that channel estimation error causes array gain loss while CSI delay causes diversity gain loss. Moreover, CSI delay causes more performance degradation than channel estimation error at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) for time varying channel. Especially our research is valuable for adaptive modulation and coding scheme and the optimization of MU-MIMO system. Numerical simulations show accurate agreement with the analytical expressions.\nTitle:\nOn BER of TDD Multiuser MIMO System with Channel Estimation Error and Delay\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our method, \"LCM over ZBDDs,\" is based on one of the most efficient state-of-the-art algorithms proposed thus far. Not only does it enumerate/list the itemsets, but it also generates a compact output data structure on the main memory. The result can be efficiently postprocessed by using algebraic ZBDD operations. The original LCM is known as an output linear time algorithm, but our new method requires a sub-linear time for the number of frequent patterns when the ZBDD-based data compression works well. Our method will greatly accelerate the data mining process and this will leads to a new style of on-memory processing for dealing with knowledge discovery problems.\nTitle:\nLCM over ZBDDS: fast generation of very large-scale frequent itemsets using a compact graph-based representation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, the reference of a paper cannot list all relevant publications and the citation relationships are not always available especially when related to copyright problem. Besides, we cannot evaluate a newly published paper before it is cited by others. Therefore, we propose an alternative method, term-based evaluation scheme which can evaluate publications by terms they use. Then we can rank conferences, journals and scholars accordingly. We think this term-based ranking scheme can be used to evaluate innovation quality for conferences and scholars. To evaluate our scheme and to facilitate its application, we develop an innovation ranking system called IRank to rank conferences and authors in the field of Database Systems .

Dynamic causal models (DCMs) of neuroimaging and electrophysiological data are frequently used for inferring effective connectivity but are presently restricted to small graphs (typically up to 10 regions) in order to keep model inversion computationally feasible. Here, we present a novel variant of DCM for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data that is suited to assess effective connectivity in large (whole-brain) networks. The approach rests on translating a linear DCM into the frequency domain and reformulating it as a special case of Bayesian linear regression. This paper derives regression DCM (rDCM) in detail and presents a variational Bayesian inversion method that enables extremely fast inference and accelerates model inversion by several orders of magnitude compared to classical DCM. Using both simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate the face validity of rDCM under different settings of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and repetition time (TR) of fMRI data. In particular, we assess the potential utility of rDCM as a tool for whole-brain connectomics by challenging it to infer effective connection strengths in a simulated whole-brain network comprising 66 regions and 300 free parameters. Our results indicate that rDCM represents a computationally highly efficient approach with promising potential for inferring whole-brain connectivity from individual fMRI data.\nTitle:\nRegression DCM for fMRI.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This is done directly from the intensity information, without explicitly computing the underlying motions. Such a measure allows us to detect similarity between video segments of differently dressed people performing the same type of activity. It requires no foreground/background segmentation, no prior learning of activities, and no motion estimation or tracking. Using this behavior-based similarity measure, we extend the notion of 2-dimensional image correlation into the 3-dimensional space-time volume, thus allowing to correlate dynamic behaviors and actions. Small space-time video segments (small video clips) are \"correlated\" against entire video sequences in all three dimensions (x,y, and t). Peak correlation values correspond to video locations with similar dynamic behaviors. Our approach can detect very complex behaviors in video sequences (e.g., ballet movements, pool dives, running water), even when multiple complex activities occur simultaneously within the field-of-view of the camera.\nTitle:\nSpace-time behavior based correlation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The contributions are (1) a new three-dimensional resonance-arousal-valence model for the representation of emotion expressed in music, together with methods for automatically classifying a piece of music in terms of this model, using robust regression methods applied to musical/acoustic features; (2) methods for predicting a listener\u2019s emotional state on the assumption that the emotional state has been determined entirely by a sequence of pieces of music recently listened to, using conditional random fields and taking into account the decay of emotion intensity over time; and (3) a method for selecting a ranked list of pieces of music that match a particular emotional state, using a minimization iteration method. A series of experiments yield information about the validity of our operationalizations of these contributions. Throughout the article, we refer to an illustrative usage scenario in which all of these contributions can be exploited, where it is assumed that (1) a listener\u2019s emotional state is being determined entirely by the music that he or she has been listening to and (2) the listener wants to hear additional music that matches his or her current emotional state.

However, interference is added to the system due to large number of uncontrolled user deployed femtocells. In this paper, downlink coexistence between macro-cells and co-channel femtocells in a single frequency OFDMA network is investigated with realistic Long Term Evolution (LTE) system parameters. The impact of femtocell density and load variation in femtocells on the performance of macrocell and femtocell UEs is presented. SINR and capacity analysis is used to evaluate the performance of the 3GPP LTE system. An auto-configuration method for femtocells by UE measurements based downlink power control is described. Results show that the interference measurement based power control significantly reduces the downlink interference in a co-channel macrocell-femtocell networks thereby providing method for realizing fem-tocell networks.\nTitle:\nPerformance analysis of co-channel deployment of femtocells with power control in 4G networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The proposed signaling scheme is compared to a classical dual-rail signaling system with regard to speed, power consumption, and reliability.

However, unlike software engineering for traditional systems, there has been little investigation of the relationship between errors and system size. In addition, there has been little analysis of the relationship between the occurrence of different types of errors. Thus, this paper investigates the empirical relationships between knowledge-based system size and number of errors, and between the number and existence of different kinds of errors. It is found that, in general, system size is statistically significantly correlated with two of those error types, and with total errors. Further it is found that the size of \u201csmaller\u201d systems is not correlated with total number of errors, but the size of \u201clarger\u201d systems is correlated with total number of errors. As a result, this evidence indicates that it can be important to use a modular approach in the development of such systems. In addition, it is found that the number of different types of errors have a statistically significant correlations with each other. Further, the existence of different errors types are statistically related. As a result, errors signal the existence of other errors.\nTitle:\nThe relationship between errors and size in knowledge-based systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Tagging adds meta-data, (weak semantics) to the content available on the web. This research investigates the potential for repurposing this layer of meta-data. We propose a multi-phase approach that exploits user-defined tags to identify and extract domain-level concepts.

These problems raise a number of questions including: \"How can we raise the level of abstraction in which the framework instantiation is expressed, reasoned about and implemented?\u9a74 \"How can the same high-level design abstractions that were used to develop the framework be used during framework instantiation instead of using source code as is done currently?\u9a74 \"How can we define extended design abstractions that can allow framework instantiation to be explicitly represented and validated?\u9a74 In this paper, we present an approach to framework instantiation based on software processes that addresses these issues. Our main goal is to represent the framework design models in an explicit and declarative way, and support changes to this design based on explicit instantiation tasks based on software processes while maintaining system integrity, invariants, and general constraints. In this way, the framework instantiation can be performed in a valid and controlled way.\nTitle:\nSoftware Process Representation and Analysis for Framework Instantiation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A distributed queue can be used to order events, user operations, or messages in a distributed system. This paper presents a new self-stabilizing distributed queuing protocol. This protocol adds self-stabilizing actions to the arrow distributed queuing protocol, a simple path-reversal protocol that runs on a spanning tree of the network. We present a proof that the protocol stabilizes to a stable state irrespective of the (perhaps faulty) initial state, and also present an analysis of the time until convergence. The self-stabilizing queuing protocol is structured as a layer that runs on top of any self-stabilizing spanning tree protocol. This additional queuing layer is guaranteed to stabilize in time bounded by a constant number of message delays across an edge, thus establishing that the stabilization time for distributed queuing is not much more than the stabilization time for spanning tree maintenance. The key idea in our protocol is that the global predicate defining the legality of a protocol state can be written as the conjunction of many purely local predicates, one for each edge of the spanning tree.\nTitle:\nSelf-Stabilizing Distributed Queuing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The learning algorithm first finds all the disjunctive clauses that are true in all interpretations, then it assigns to each disjunct in the head a probability and finally decides how to combine the clauses to form an LPAD by solving a constraint satisfaction problem.

Current ranking techniques are based on one of two sub-optimal approaches: either they optimize for a binary metric such as Average Precision, which discards information on relevance levels, or they optimize for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), which ignores the dependence of an item's contribution on the relevance of more highly ranked items. We address the shortcomings of existing approaches by proposing GAPfm, the Graded Average Precision factor model, which is a latent factor model for top-N recommendation in domains with graded relevance data. The model optimizes the Graded Average Precision metric that has been proposed recently for assessing the quality of ranked results lists for graded relevance. GAPfm's advantages are twofold: it maintains full information about graded relevance and also addresses the limitations of models that optimize NDCG. Experimental results show that GAPfm achieves substantial improvements on the top-N recommendation task, compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.\nTitle:\nGAPfm: optimal top-n recommendations for graded relevance domains\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we perform an information-theoretic analysis of finite length digital fingerprinting systems in a private content identification setup and reveal certain connections between fingerprint based content identification and Forney's erasure/list decoding [1].

However, this common i.i.d. assumption is unreasonable for relational data. In this paper, by explicitly modeling covariance between instances as derived from the relational information, we propose a novel probabilistic dimensionality reduction method, called probabilistic relational PCA (PRPCA), for relational data analysis. Although the i.i.d. assumption is no longer adopted in PRPCA, the learning algorithms for PRPCA can still be devised easily like those for PPCA which makes explicit use of the i.i.d. assumption.

We also present an adaptation of our approach to achieve the complementary goal of \"fair affirmative action,\" which guarantees statistical parity (i.e., the demographics of the set of individuals receiving any classification are the same as the demographics of the underlying population), while treating similar individuals as similarly as possible.

Knowing which instances are misclassified and understanding why they are misclassified and how they contribute to data set complexity can improve the learning process and could guide the future development of learning algorithms and data analysis methods. The goal of this paper is to better understand the data used in machine learning problems by identifying and analyzing the instances that are frequently misclassified by learning algorithms that have shown utility to date and are commonly used in practice. We identify instances that are hard to classify correctly () by classifying over 190,000 instances from 64 data sets with 9 learning algorithms. We then use a set of hardness measures to understand why some instances are harder to classify correctly than others. We find that class overlap is a principal contributor to instance hardness. We seek to integrate this information into the training process to alleviate the effects of class overlap and present ways that instance hardness can be used to improve learning.\nTitle:\nAn instance level analysis of data complexity.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Query relaxation is required due to the fact that queries tend not to be expressed exactly by the users, especially in scientific databases such as biological databases, in which complex domain knowledge is heavily involved. To treat this problem, we propose the concept of the so-called fuzzy equivalence classes to capture important kinds of domain knowledge that is used to relax queries. This concept is further integrated with the canonical techniques for pattern searching such as the position tree and automaton theory. As a result, fuzzy queries produced through relaxation can be efficiently evaluated. This method has been successfully utilized in a practical biological database - the GPCRDB.\nTitle:\nOn the efficient evaluation of relaxed queries in biological databases\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Point solutions for individual problems further increase system complexity while not addressing the underlying causes. In this paper, we argue that many network-management problems stem from the same root cause---the need to maintain consistency between the physical and logical configuration of the routers. Hence, we propose VROOM (Virtual ROuters On the Move), a new network-management primitive that avoids unnecessary changes to the logical topology by allowing (virtual) routers to freely move from one physical node to another. In addition to simplifying existing network-management tasks like planned maintenance and service deployment, VROOM can also help tackle emerging challenges such as reducing energy consumption. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of novel migration techniques for virtual routers with either hardware or software data planes. Our evaluation shows that VROOM is transparent to routing protocols and results in no performance impact on the data traffic when a hardware-based data plane is used.\nTitle:\nVirtual routers on the move: live router migration as a network-management primitive\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Given a database S of objects in a metric space M and a query object q in M, in a range searching problem the goal is to find the objects of S within some threshold distance to q, whereas in a k-nearest neighbor searching problem, the k elements of S closest to q must be produced. These problems can obviously be solved with a linear number of distance calculations, by comparing the query object against every object in the database. However, the goal is to solve such problems much faster. We combine and extend ideas from the M-Tree, the Multivantage Point structure, and the FQ-Tree to create a new structure in the \"bisector tree\u9a74 class, called the Antipole Tree.

The final winners a,b of such a tournament are far enough apart to approximate the diameter of the splitting set. If {\\rm{dist}}(a,b) is larger than the chosen cluster diameter threshold, then the cluster is split. The proposed data structure is an indexing scheme suitable for (exact and approximate) best match searching on generic metric spaces. The Antipole Tree outperforms by a factor of approximately two existing structures such as List of Clusters, M-Trees, and others and, in many cases, it achieves better clustering properties.\nTitle:\nAntipole Tree Indexing to Support Range Search and K-Nearest Neighbor Search in Metric Spaces\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A bicluster reflects a strong association between a subset of objects and a subset of attributes in a numerical object/attribute data-table. So called biclusters of similar values can be thought as maximal sub-tables with close values. Only few methods address a complete, correct and non redundant enumeration of such patterns, which is a well-known intractable problem, while no formal framework exists. In this paper, we introduce important links between biclustering and formal concept analysis. More specifically, we originally show that Triadic Concept Analysis (TCA), provides a nice mathematical framework for biclustering. Interestingly, existing algorithms of TCA, that usually apply on binary data, can be used (directly or with slight modifications) after a preprocessing step for extracting maximal biclusters of similar values. \nTitle:\nMining Biclusters of Similar Values with Triadic Concept Analysis\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The ease of programmability makes SDN a great platform implementation of various initiatives that involve application deployment, security solutions, and decentralized network management in a multi-tenant data center environment. Although this can introduce many applications in different areas and leads to the high impact on several aspects, security of SDN architecture remains an open question and needs to be revisited based on the new concept of SDN. Current SDN-based attack detection mechanisms have some limitations. In this paper, we investigate two of those limitations: Misbehavior Attack and NewFlow Attack. We propose a secure system that periodically collects network statistics from the forwarding elements and apply Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms. Our framework ensures that the proposed solution makes the SDN architecture more self-adaptive, and intelligent while reacting to network changes.\n\n\nTitle:\nA Defense System for Defeating DDoS Attacks in SDN based Networks.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It is assumed that feedback controller is designed neglecting some disturbances, which could be approximately modeled by a dynamic LuGre friction model. We are interested to derive an additive observer-based compensator to annihilate or reduce the influence of such a disturbance. We exploit a recently suggested approach for observer design for LuGre-friction-model-based compensation. In order to follow this technique, it is necessary to know the Lyapunov function for the unperturbed system, parameters of the dynamic friction model, and to have certain structural property satisfied. The case when this property is passivity with respect to the matching disturbance related to the given Lyapunov function is illustrated in the paper with an example of a DC-motor. The main contribution is some new insights into numerical real time implementation of friction compensators for various LuGre-type models. The other contribution, built upon the main one, is experimental verification of the suggested observer design procedure.\nTitle:\nFriction Compensation Based On Lugre Model\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We test our methodology on two totally different applications from both cloud computing and enterprise scenarios. Our solution is novel in that it takes into account the dependence of power consumption on temperature, attributed to temperature-induced changes in leakage current and fan speed. While this dependence is well-known, we are the first to consider it in the context of minimizing service delay. Accordingly, we implement our optimization strategies with Hadoop, Tomcat, and MySQL on a 40-node cluster. The experimental results show that our solution cannot only limit the power consumption to the power budget but also achieves smaller delay against static solutions and temperature oblivious DVFS solutions.\nTitle:\nTemperature aware power allocation: An optimization framework and case studies\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

As a user creates a password, Telepathwords makes realtime predictions for the next character that user will type. While the concept is simple, making accurate predictions requires efficient algorithms to model users' behavior and to employ already-typed characters to predict subsequent ones. We first made the Telepathwords technology available to the public in late 2013 and have since served hundreds of thousands of user sessions. We ran a human-subjects experiment to compare password policies that use Telepathwords to those that rely on composition rules, comparing participants' passwords using two different password-evaluation algorithms. We found that participants create far fewer weak passwords using the Telepathwords-based policies than policies based only on character composition. Participants using Telepathwords were also more likely to report that the password feedback was helpful.\nTitle:\nTelepathwords: preventing weak passwords by reading users' minds\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It is challenging to formalize languages comprising all these features. In this paper, we integrate probability, time and concurrency in one single model, where the concurrency feature is modelled using shared-variable based communication. The probability feature is represented by a probabilistic nondeterministic choice, probabilistic guarded choice and a probabilistic version of parallel composition. We formalize an operational semantics for such an integration. Based on this model we define a bisimulation relation, from which an observational equivalence between probabilistic programs is investigated and a collection of algebraic laws are explored. We also implement a prototype of the operational semantics to animate the execution of probabilistic programs\nTitle:\nIntegrating Probability with Time and Shared-Variable Concurrency\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A seller has K copies of an item to sell, and there are n buyers, each interested in only one copy, and has some value for the item. The seller posts a price for each buyer, using Bayesian information about buyers' valuations, who arrive in a sequence. An SPM specifies the ordering of buyers and the posted prices, and may be adaptive or non-adaptive in its behavior. The goal is to design SPM in polynomial time to maximize expected revenue. We compare against the expected revenue of optimal SPM, and provide a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for both nonadaptive and adaptive SPMs. This is achieved by two algorithms: an efficient algorithm that gives a (1 - 1/\u221a2\u03c0K)-approximation (and hence a PTAS for sufficiently large K), and another that is a PTAS for constant K. The first algorithm yields a non-adaptive SPM that yields its approximation guarantees against an optimal adaptive SPM - this implies that the adaptivity gap in SPMs vanishes as K becomes larger.\nTitle:\nApproximation schemes for sequential posted pricing in multi-unit auctions\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This problem is of interest for queries on XML and other hierarchical data, to provide query feedback and for cost-based query optimization. Our summary data structure scalably represents approximate frequency information about twiglets (i.e., small twigs) in the data tree. Given a twig query, the number of matches is estimated by creating a set of query twiglets, and combining two complementary approaches: Set Hashing, used to estimate the number of matches of each query twiglet, and Maximal Overlap, used to combine the query twiglet estimates into an estimate for the twig query. We propose several estimation algorithms that apply these approaches on query twiglets formed using variations on different twiglet decomposition techniques. We present an extensive experimental evaluation using several real XML data sets, with a variety of twig queries. Our results demonstrate that accurate and robust estimates can be achieved, even with limited space.\nTitle:\nCounting Twig Matches in a Tree\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Instead, each user maintains locally a limited view of the graph. For example, in a phone network, each user keeps a contact list locally in her phone, and does not have access to other users' contacts. The contact lists of all users form an implicit social graph that could be very useful to study the interaction patterns among different populations. However, due to privacy concerns, one could not simply collect the unfettered local views from users and reconstruct a decentralized social network.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate techniques to ensure local differential privacy of individuals while collecting structural information and generating representative synthetic social graphs. We show that existing local differential privacy and synthetic graph generation techniques are insufficient for preserving important graph properties, due to excessive noise injection, inability to retain important graph structure, or both. Motivated by this, we propose LDPGen, a novel multi-phase technique that incrementally clusters users based on their connections to different partitions of the whole population. Every time a user reports information, LDPGen carefully injects noise to ensure local differential privacy.We derive optimal parameters in this process to cluster structurally-similar users together. Once a good clustering of users is obtained, LDPGen adapts existing social graph generation models to construct a synthetic social graph.\n\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments over four real datasets to evaluate the quality of the obtained synthetic graphs, using a variety of metrics, including (i) important graph structural measures; (ii) quality of community discovery; and (iii) applicability in social recommendation. Our experiments show that the proposed technique produces high-quality synthetic graphs that well represent the original decentralized social graphs, and significantly outperform those from baseline approaches.\n\n\nTitle:\nGenerating Synthetic Decentralized Social Graphs with Local Differential Privacy.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We argue that its findings are highly abstract. Our argument is supported by the mechanised inductive analysis of a protocol based on smart cards that was shown to enjoy provable security and then implemented. It appears that the protocol grants no reasonable guarantees of session key confidentiality to its peers in the realistic setting where an intruder can exploit other agents' cards. Indeed, the formal argument on confidentiality requires assumptions that no peer can verify in practice.

In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework for memory-based CF (PMCF). While this framework has clear links with classical memory-based CF, it allows us to find principled solutions to known problems of CF-based recommender systems. In particular, we show that a probabilistic active learning method can be used to actively query the user, thereby solving the \u9a74new user problem.\u9a74 Furthermore, the probabilistic framework allows us to reduce the computational cost of memory-based CF by working on a carefully selected subset of user profiles, while retaining high accuracy.

It does this by treating query processing as routing of tuples through operators and making per-tuple routing decisions. The benefits of such adaptivity can be significant, especially in highly dynamic environments such as data streams, sensor query processing, web querying, etc. Various parties have asserted that the cost of making per-tuple routing decisions is prohibitive. We have implemented eddies in the PostgreSQL open source database system [1] in the context of the TelegraphCQ project.

Traditionally, such routing is done using the least-loaded concept, and thus results in balancing the load across the set of candidate routes. In this paper, we propose the use of load profiling as an attractive alternative to load balancing for routing guaranteed bandwidth VCs (flows). Load profiling techniques allow the distribution of \"available\" bandwidth across a set of candidate routes to match the characteristics of incoming VC QoS requests. We thoroughly characterize the performance of VC routing using load profiling and contrast it to routing using load balancing and load packing. We do so both analytically and via extensive simulations of multi-class traffic routing in Virtual Path (VP) based networks. Our findings show that for routing guaranteed bandwidth flows in VP networks,load profiling is desirable as it reduces VP bandwidth fragmentation, which increases the likelihood of accepting new VC requests. This fragmentation could be particularly harmful when the granularity of VC requests is large. Typically, this occurs when a common VC is established to carry the aggregate traffic flow of many high-bandwidth real-time sources. For VP-based networks, our simulation results show that our load-profiling VC routing scheme performs better or as well as the traditional load-balancing VC routing in terms of revenue under both skewed and uniform workloads. Furthermore, load-profiling routing improves routing fairness by proactively increasing the chances of admitting high-bandwidth flows.\nTitle:\nLoad Profiling Based Routing for Guaranteed Bandwidth Flows\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

While replication is relatively easy for services with fully deterministic behavior, grid and Web services often include nondeterministic operations. The traditional way to replicate such nondeterministic services is to use the primary-backup approach. While this is straightforward in synchronous systems with perfect failure detection, typical grid environments are not usually considered to be synchronous systems. This paper addresses the problem of replicating nondeterministic services by designing a protocol based on Paxos and proposing two performance optimizations suitable for replicated grid services. The first improves the performance in the case where some service operations do not change the service state, while the second optimizes grid service requests that use transactions. Evaluations done both on a local cluster and on Planet-Lab demonstrate that these optimizations significantly reduce the service response time and increase the throughput of replicated services\nTitle:\nReplicating Nondeterministic Services on Grid Environments\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Photorealistic and non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) are two ways to achieve this goal. Compared with photorealistic rendering, NPR stylizes both the real and virtual content and makes them indistinguishable. Maintaining temporal coherence is a key challenge in NPR. We propose a NPR framework with support for temporal coherence by leveraging model-space information. Our systems targets painterly rendering styles of NPR. There are three major steps in this rendering framework for creating coherent results: tensor field creation, brush anchor placement, and brush stroke reshaping. To achieve temporal coherence for the final rendered results, we propose a new projection-based surface sampling algorithm which generates anchor points on model surfaces. The 2D projections of these samples are uniformly distributed in image space for optimal brush stroke placement. We also propose a general method for averaging various properties of brush stroke textures, such as their skeletons and colors, to further improve the temporal coherence. We apply these methods to both static and animated models to create a painterly rendering style for AR. Compared with existing image space algorithms our method renders AR with NPR effects with a high degree of coherence.\nTitle:\nA non-photorealistic rendering framework with temporal coherence for augmented reality\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

What the governments are trying to accomplish is to positively link individuals to these identity documents. But if a n impostor is capable of forging a passport, complete with embedded biometric, the document could still pass the biometric authentication step. To prevent the system from being compromised in this manner, a central repository of biometric templates could be incorporated . Then the system could compare its 'live' biometric reading with the remote repository, rather than relying solely on the authenticity of the biometric embedded within the identit y document. Using a central repository raises certain questions. Firstly, how will the system know which repository to query? How can the system be sure the passport is not fraudulent and referring queries to a fake repository? How will the repository know it is communicating with a valid port system and not just wasting time with fraudulent queries performing a denial of service attack? This paper proposes a model for the construction of a passport system that employs a set of na tional repositories for biometric identification that addresses these issues.\nTitle:\nUsing A Central Data Repository For Biometric Authentication In Passport Systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

When multiple machines are available, the machine environment may range from identical machines (the processing time required by a job is invariant across the machines) at one end of the spectrum to unrelated machines (the processing time required by a job on each machine is specified by an arbitrary vector) at the other end. While the problem is strongly NP-hard even in the case of a single machine, constant factor approximation algorithms are known for even the most general machine environment of unrelated machines. Recently a PTAS was discovered for the case of identical parallel machines [1]. In contrast, the problem is MAX SNP-hard for unrelated machines [11]. An important open problem was to determine the approximability of the intermediate case of uniformly related machines where each machine has a speed and it takes p/s time to process a job of size p on a machine with speed s. We resolve the complexity of this problem by obtaining a PTAS. This improves the earlier known approximation ratio of (2 + \u0190).\nTitle:\nA PTAS for Minimizing Weighted Completion Time on Uniformly Related Machines\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

An essential problem of web data integration is to discover semantic correspondences between web table columns, and schema matching is a popular means to determine the semantic correspondences. However, conventional schema matching techniques are not always effective for web table matching due to the incompleteness in web tables. In this paper, we propose a two-pronged approach for web table matching that effectively addresses the above difficulties. First, we propose a concept-based approach that maps each column of a web table to the best concept, in a well-developed knowledge base, that represents it. This approach overcomes the problem that sometimes values of two web table columns may be disjoint, even though the columns are related, due to incompleteness in the column values. Second, we develop a hybrid machine-crowdsourcing framework that leverages human intelligence to discern the concepts for \u201cdifficult\u201d columns. Our overall framework assigns the most \u201cbeneficial\u201d column-to-concept matching tasks to the crowd under a given budget and utilizes the crowdsourcing result to help our algorithm infer the best matches for the rest of the columns. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through an extensive experimental study over two real-world web table data sets. The results show that our two-pronged approach outperforms existing schema matching techniques at only a low cost for crowdsourcing.\nTitle:\nA hybrid machine-crowdsourcing system for matching web tables\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Multi-path video streaming, network coding based routing, and network flow control are jointly optimized to maximize a network utility function defined over heterogeneous receivers. Content priority of video coding layers is considered during the flow routing to determine the optimal multicast paths and associated data rates for each layer. Our optimization scheme attempts to find content distribution meshes with minimum path costs for each video coding layer while satisfying the inter-layer dependency during scalable video coding. Based on primal decomposition and primal-dual analysis, we develop a decentralized algorithm with two optimization levels to solve the performance optimization problem. We also prove the stability and convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm using Lyapunov theories. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the max-flow throughput using network coding, but also provides better video quality with balanced layered access for heterogeneous receivers.\nTitle:\nPrioritized Flow Optimization With Multi-Path and Network Coding Based Routing for Scalable Multirate Multicasting\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We specially target on peer to peer systems and its capability to distribute parallel computation, which transfer large amount of data (called intensive-communicated applications) among large number of processors.

While promising, these approaches are limited in that they often require a developer to be in the loop. As such, it is difficult for an organization to deploy multiple crowdsourced EM solutions, because there are simply not enough developers. To address this problem, a recent work has proposed Corleone, a solution that crowdsources the entire EM workflow, requiring no developers. While promising, Corleone is severely limited in that it does not scale to large tables. We propose Falcon, a solution that scales up the hands-off crowdsourced EM approach of Corleone, using RDBMS-style query execution and optimization over a Hadoop cluster. Specifically, we define a set of operators and develop efficient implementations. We translate a hands-off crowdsourced EM workflow into a plan consisting of these operators, optimize, then execute the plan. These plans involve both machine and crowd activities, giving rise to novel optimization techniques such as using crowd time to mask machine time. Extensive experiments show that Falcon can scale up to tables of millions of tuples, thus providing a practical solution for hands-off crowdsourced EM, to build cloud-based EM services.\nTitle:\nFalcon: Scaling Up Hands-Off Crowdsourced Entity Matching to Build Cloud Services.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Nowadays, a number of automatic tools exist, often based on type systems or static analysis, which produce such resource guarantees. In spite of being based on theoretically sound techniques, the implemented tools may contain bugs which render the resource guarantees thus obtained not completely trustworthy. Performing full-blown verification of such tools is a daunting task, since they are large and complex. In this work we investigate an alternative approach whereby, instead of the tools, we formally verify the results of the tools. We have implemented this idea using COSTA, a state-of-the-art static analysis system, for producing resource guarantees and KeY, a state-of-the-art verification tool, for formally verifying the correctness of such resource guarantees. Our preliminary results show that the proposed tool cooperation can be used for automatically producing verified resource guarantees.\nTitle:\nVerified resource guarantees using COSTA and KeY\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Texture segmentation and texture characteristic expression are two important areas in image pattern recognition. Nevertheless, until now, how to find an effective way for accomplishing these tasks is still a major challenge in practical applications such as iris image processing. We propose a framework for ACO based image processing methods. Considering the specific characteristics of various tasks, such a framework possesses the flexibility of only defining different criteria for ant behavior correspondingly. By defining different kinds of direction probability and movement difficulty for artificial ants, an ACO based image segmentation algorithm and a texture representation method are then presented for automatic iris image processing. Experimental results demonstrated that the ACO based image processing methods are competitive and quite promising, with excellent effectiveness and practicability especially for images with complex local texture situations.\nTitle:\nA universal texture segmentation and representation scheme based on ant colony optimization for iris image processing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A particularly harmful attack against sensor and ad hoc networks is known as the Sybil attack [6], where a node illegitimately claims multiple identities. This paper systematically analyzes the threat posed by the Sybil attack to wireless sensor networks. We demonstrate that the attack can be exceedingly detrimental to many important functions of the sensor network such as routing, resource allocation, misbehavior detection, etc. We establish a classification of di! erent types of the Sybil attack, which enables us to better understand the threats posed by each type, and better design countermeasures against each type. We then propose several novel techniques to defend against the Sybil attack, and analyze their e! ectiveness quantitatively.

We improve upon existing voting-based symmetry detection techniques by leveraging the Lie group structure of geometric transformations. In particular, we introduce a logarithmic mapping that ensures that orbits are mapped to linear subspaces, hence unifying and extending many existing mappings in a single Lie-algebra voting formulation. Compared to previous work, our resulting method offers significantly improved robustness as it guarantees that our symmetry detection of an input model is frame, scale, and reflection invariant. As a consequence, we demonstrate that our approach efficiently and reliably discovers symmetries and orbits of geometric datasets without requiring heavy parameter tuning.\nTitle:\nSymmetry and Orbit Detection via Lie-Algebra Voting.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We show that such geometric textures allow interactive and versatile editing and animation, producing compelling visual effects that are difficult to achieve with traditional texturing methods. Unlike pixel-based image quilting, mesh quilting is based on stitching together 3D geometry elements. Our quilting algorithm finds corresponding geometry elements in adjacent texture patches, aligns elements through local deformation, and merges elements to seamlessly connect texture patches. For mesh quilting on curved surfaces, a critical issue is to reduce distortion of geometry elements inside the 3D space of the thin shell. To address this problem we introduce a low-distortion parameterization of the shell space so that geometry elements can be synthesized even on very curved objects without the visual distortion present in previous approaches. We demonstrate how mesh quilting can be used to generate convincing decorations for a wide range of geometric textures.\n\n\nTitle:\nMesh quilting for geometric texture synthesis\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The lessons learned from the past DDoS mitigation designs indicate that the heavy reliance on additional software modules and dedicated hardware devices seriously impede their widespread deployment. This paper proposes an autonomic DDoS defense framework, called ArOMA, that leverages the programmability and centralized manageability features of Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. Specifically, ArOMA can systematically bridge the gaps between different security functions, ranging from traffic monitoring to anomaly detection to mitigation, while sparing human operators from non-trivial interventions. It also facilitates the collaborations between ISPs and their customers on DDoS mitigation by logically distributing the essential security functions, allowing the ISP to handle DDoS traffic based on the requests of its customers. Our experimental results demonstrate that, in the face of DDoS flooding attacks, ArOMA can effectively maintain the performance of video streams at a satisfactory level.\nTitle:\nArOMA: An SDN based autonomic DDoS mitigation framework.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To deal with variations with respect to viewpoint and camera positions, a group of points of interest (POI) is extracted to represent the image for robust matching. To cope with illumination changes, we propose to produce a contrast image for each video frame by using the root mean square strategy, thus all the POIs are extracted from the corresponding contrast images to provide perceptually consistent measurement of image content. To achieve effective image matching, modeling of robot behavior for model constrained matching is proposed, where normalized cross correlation is employed for local matching to determine corresponding POI pairs followed by homography based global optimization using RANSAC. Meanwhile, application of specific constraints also helps to exclude irrelevant frames in the training set to further improve the efficiency and robustness. The proposed approach has been successfully applied to the Robot Vision task for the ImageCLEF workshop, and the experimental results have fully demonstrated the high-quality performance of our approaches in terms of both precision and robustness. The system and approach outlined in this paper was ranked the second best in the optional task group in ImageCLEF 2009. In addition to demonstrating the merits of our approach in isolation, we also illustrate the benefits of our proposed approach in comparison with other submissions.\nTitle:\nEffective venue image retrieval using robust feature extraction and model constrained matching for mobile robot localization\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The key to improving performance in DTNs is to engineer a greater number of transfer opportunities. We earlier proposed the use of throwbox nodes, which are stationary, battery powered nodes with storage and processing, to enhance the capacity of DTNs. However, the use of throwboxes without efficient power management is minimally effective. If the nodes are too liberal with their energy consumption, they will fail prematurely. However if they are too conservative, they may miss important transfer opportunities, hence increasing lifetime without improving performance.In this paper, we present a hardware and software architecture for energy efficient throwboxes in DTNs. We propose a hardware platform that uses a multi-tiered, multi-radio, scalable, solar powered platform. The throwbox employs an approximate heuristic for solving the NP-Hard problem of meeting an average power constraint while maximizing the number of bytes forwarded by it. We built and deployed prototype throwboxes in UMassDieselNet - a bus DTN testbed. Through extensive trace-driven simulations and prototype deployment we show that a single throwbox with a 270 cm 2 solar panel can run perpetually while improving packet delivery by 37% and reducing message delivery latency by at least 10% in the network.\nTitle:\nAn Energy-Efficient Architecture For Dtn Throwboxes\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The sensor nodes are responsible to detect the new environment and monitor the variable situation, but suffer from battery powered with energy limitation. In this paper, we define the power consumption problem in the overlapping area based on integer linear programming ILP. Then, we propose a game-based model named non-zero-sum duty-cycle game NZS-DCG to express the cooperation between sensor nodes, and formulate the equilibratory equation based on Nash Equilibrium to decide the optimal strategy. The simulation results show that the cooperative scheme provides the lowest power consumption and the longest network lifetime than other related literatures. In conclusion, the power conservation and traffic relieving in WSN can be achieved by the proposed game model.\nTitle:\nAn efficient power conservation scheme in non-zero-sum duty-cycle game for wireless sensor networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

These applications have to be adaptable to unforeseen changes in the functionality offered by component services and to their unavailability or decreasing performances. Furthermore, when applications are made available to a high number of potential users, they should also be able to dynamically adapt to the current context of use as well as to specific requirements and needs of the specific users. In order to address these issues, mechanisms that enable adaptation should be introduced in the life-cycle of applications, both in the design and in the runtime phases. In this paper we propose an extension of a basic iterative service-based applications lifecycle with elements able to deal with the adaptation-specific needs. We focus, in particular, on the design phase and suggest a number of design principles and guidelines that are suitable to enable adaptation. We discuss about the effectiveness of the proposed methodology by means of real-world scenarios over various types of service-based applications.\nTitle:\nDesign for adaptation of service-based applications: main issues and requirements\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Changes to requirements on different abstraction levels are arriving continuously and have an impact on long-term selected features. [Question/problem] The major question is how to successfully do SRP to create competitive advantage. [Principal ideas/results] An exploratory case study in an industrial context was conducted (1) to get a deeper understanding of the as-is SRP process in practice, (2) to evaluate the suitability of a to-be SRP process, introducing the EVOLVE II method and corresponding ReleasePlanner tool and (3) to gather additional requirements for the to-be SRP process, with respect to feature generation and feature selection.

For this purpose, we propose to consider shear stress&#x2014;the stretching and shear of particles inside a flow&#x2014;in vortex dynamics. Based on a discussion and comparison of recent methods for computing shear stress, we introduce visualization techniques in order to provide a representation of shear layers according to their physical interpretation. This paper contributes a combination of theory in fluid mechanics and the corresponding visualization: (1) shear layer criteria are assessed according to how well they can be combined with common vortex identification criteria; (2) sheets of maximal shear are introduced as an appropriate visual representation of shear layers; (3) a visualization method is described for simultaneous tracking of vortices and shear layers as well as their interaction; (4) the relevance of shear layers in vortex dynamics is demonstrated by means of several examples. We have implemented these new techniques in an interactive visualization system for time-dependent 3D flow. The system is used by fluid-mechanics experts in their research of shear-vortex interaction.\nTitle:\nVisualizing the Evolution and Interaction of Vortices and Shear Layers in Time-Dependent 3D Flow.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This problem can be applied to predict popularity of blog posts, rank photographs in a photo-sharing system, or predict the citations of a scientific article using author information and monitoring the items of interest for a short period of time after their creation. As a case study, we show how to estimate the number of citations for an academic paper using information about past articles written by the same author(s) of the paper. If we use only the citation information over a short period of time, we obtain a predicted value that has a correlation of r = 0.57 with the actual value. This is our baseline prediction. Our best-performing system can improve that prediction by adding features extracted from the past publishing history of its authors, increasing the correlation between the actual and the predicted values to r = 0.81.\nTitle:\nEstimating number of citations using author reputation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we focus on the task of ranking authors. Although previous work has used content-based approaches or citation network link analyses, the combination of the two with topical link analyses is unexplored. Moreover, previous citation analysis applications are typically limited to a graph based on author citations, or a bipartite graph based on author and paper citations. We present in this paper a novel integrated probabilistic model which combines a content-based approach with a multi-type citation network which integrates citations among papers, authors, affiliations and publishing venues in a single model. We further introduce the application of Topical PageRank into citation network link analysis due to the fact that researchers may be experts in different scientific domains. Finally, we describe a heterogenous link analysis of the citation network, exploring the impact of weighting various factors. Comparative experimental results based on data extracted from the ACM digital library show that 1) the multi-type citation graph works better than citation graphs integrating fewer types of entities, 2) the use of Topical PageRank can further improve performance, and 3) Heterogenous PageRank with parameter tuning can work even better than Topical PageRank.\n\n\nTitle:\nTopic-driven multi-type citation network analysis\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Real-life SoCs typically include hot-modules such as DRAM controller or floating point unit, which are bandwidth limited and in high demand by other units. In this paper we demonstrate that the mere existence of one or more hot-modules in a wormhole-based NoC dramatically reduces network efficiency and causes an unfair allocation of system resources. We demonstrate that a single hot-module destroys the performance of the entire SoC, even if network resources are over-provisioned. In order to resolve the hot-module effect, we introduce a novel low-cost credit based distributed access regulation technique that fairly allocates access rights to the hot-module. Unlike other methods, this technique directly addresses the root cause of network buffer congestion phenomena. Using simulation, we show the effectiveness of the suggested mechanism in various NoC scenarios.\nTitle:\nAccess Regulation to Hot-Modules in Wormhole NoCs\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Compared with current available online geolocation-oriented photo exploring websites, such as Flickr and Panoramio, ViewFocus is characterized with its ability of supporting precise exploration of specific places or viewing angles of interests on the map with the view direction filtered photos. To achieve this goal, we present a practical solution to estimate the view directions of photos via fast visual search, robust object matching and camera reconstruction techniques, and geo-registers the directions on the map. Thus, the proposed system allows users to (1) select the places they are interested in and then focus their exploration and (2) walk freely through the map and view what can be seen along their eyes with the automatically returned precise set of photos of the target places/angles, by filtering out photos that are pointing to other directions.

The robot collects training images by rotating the grasped object in front of a camera.

We introduce the basic jumping mobility paradigm, as well as the evolution of our hopping robot concept by way of the main prototypes that we have developed. These prototypes show that a small number of actuators can control the vehicle's steering, hopping, and self-righting motions. The last prototype is equipped with wheels so that precision motion can be combined with gross hopping motion. Lessons learned during the development of these prototypes have general applicability to the design of jumping robots. In addition to reviewing the issues relevant to the design of jumping systems, in this paper we describe some of the key mechanisms that enable our approach, we summarize tests obtained with these systems, and we present our future plans of localization and sensing for hopping mobility.\nTitle:\nMinimalist Jumping Robots For Celestial Exploration\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Although the use of this approach is intensifying in all its key genres (paid-for crowdsourcing, games with a purpose, volunteering-based approaches), the community still lacks a set of best-practice guidelines similar to the annotation best practices for traditional, expert-based corpus acquisition. In this paper we focus on the use of crowdsourcing methods for corpus acquisition and propose a set of best practice guidelines based in our own experiences in this area and an overview of related literature. We also introduce GATE Crowd, a plugin of the GATE platform that relies on these guidelines and offers tool support for using crowdsourcing in a more principled and efficient manner.\nTitle:\nCorpus Annotation through Crowdsourcing: Towards Best Practice Guidelines.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Thus, personalized image analysis, indexing, and retrieval have become important topics in social media analysis. Because of users' diverse preferences, their personalized image sets are usually related to specific topics and show large feature distribution bias from general Internet images. Therefore, the visual vocabulary trained on general Internet images may could not fit across users' personalized image sets very well. To improve the image retrieval performance on personalized image sets, we propose the personalized visual vocabulary adaption which removes non-discriminative visual words and replaces them with more exact and discriminative ones, i.e., adapt a general vocabulary toward a specific user's image set. The proposed algorithm updates the visual vocabulary during off-line feature quantization, and operates on a limited number of visual words, hence shows satisfying efficiency. Extensive experiments of image search on public datasets demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of our approach.\nTitle:\nPersonalized Visual Vocabulary Adaption for Social Image Retrieval\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

(2003) [3], where a gene is modeled as a signed graph. The gene assembly, based on three types of operations only, is then modeled as a graph reduction process (to the empty graph). Motivated by the robustness of the gene assembly process, the notions of parallel reduction and parallel complexity of signed graphs have been considered in Harju et al. (2006) [7]. We describe in this paper an exact algorithm for computing the parallel complexity of a given signed graph and for finding an optimal parallel reduction for it. Checking the parallel applicability of a given set of operations and scanning all possible selections amount to a high computational complexity. We also briefly discuss a faster approximate algorithm that however, cannot guarantee finding the optimal reduction.\nTitle:\nComputing the graph-based parallel complexity of gene assembly\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Such an imaging system provides a human user or a vision system significant control over the radiometric and geometric characteristics of the system. This flexibility is achieved using a programmable array of micro-mirrors. The orientations of the mirrors of the array can be controlled with high precision over space and time. This enables the system to select and modulate rays from the scene's light field based on the needs of the application at hand.We have implemented a programmable imaging system that uses a digital micro-mirror device (DMD), which is used in digital light processing. Although the mirrors of this device can only be positioned in one of two states, we show that our system can be used to implement a wide variety of imaging functions, including, high dynamic range imaging, feature detection, and object recognition. We also describe how a micro-mirror array that allows full control over the orientations of its mirrors can be used to instantly change the field of view and resolution characteristics of the imaging system. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of programmable imaging for computer vision.\nTitle:\nProgrammable Imaging: Towards a Flexible Camera\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Since a DVS can only be verified by a designated verifier, in addition to the re-sign algorithm which allows a proxy to use a resign key to change the signer of a DVS on a message, we also define the re-designate-verifier algorithm for DVPRS which allows a proxy to change the designated verifier of a DVS. We present the formal definition, security model, and an efficient construction of DVPRS, and prove its security under some standard assumptions.

With the development of 3G networks and mobile computing technology, the number of group-oriented applications is increasing rapidly. Although these applications are convenient, achieving secure group communication to protect user privacy is a major concern. This study presents an authenticated group key agreement protocol for mobile environments. By using certificateless public key cryptography, the protocol reduces the cost of managing the certificates and avoids the key escrow problem. Instead of a fully-trusted server, the protocol uses a semi-trusted server, which helps users communicate but does not learn about the group key.

P4 works in conjunction with SDN control protocols like OpenFlow. In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly specifies protocol headers on which it operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 fields in a few years, increasing the complexity of the specification while still not providing the flexibility to add new headers. In this paper we propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three goals: (1) Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers should be able to change the way switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches should not be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target independence: Programmers should be able to describe packet-processing functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. As an example, we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to add a new hierarchical label.\nTitle:\nP4: programming protocol-independent packet processors\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We demonstrate an average of 8--10% more recall using the first approach. We discuss some of the problems with machine translation and their effect on pattern discovery which lead to this difference in performance.\nTitle:\nCross-lingual information extraction system evaluation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Often, these activities involve textual communication between a criminal and a victim, or between criminals themselves. The forensic analysis of online textual documents for addressing the anonymity problem called authorship analysis is the focus of most cybercrime investigations. Authorship analysis is the statistical study of linguistic and computational characteristics of the written documents of individuals. This paper is the first work that presents a unified data mining solution to address authorship analysis problems based on the concept of frequent pattern-based writeprint. Extensive experiments on real-life data suggest that our proposed solution can precisely capture the writing styles of individuals. Furthermore, the writeprint is effective to identify the author of an anonymous text from a group of suspects and to infer sociolinguistic characteristics of the author.\nTitle:\nA unified data mining solution for authorship analysis in anonymous textual communications\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Each pattern has a title, and collectively the titles form a language for design [1] Pattern Languages are in life, simply a collection of interrelated patterns [2]. These interrelated patterns are combined in any way and combination to create new environments, where practitioners can solve context-specific problems. Precisely, the concept of pattern languages has invaded over into the software engineering field, to describe prior experiences and the processes that stem from them, in a very simple language, where patterns are tactfully woven as a whole, and can be combined in any manner to solve a particular and complex problem. Yet, this process is still done in an ad-hoc manner and is not straightforward enough, to ease and speed up the software development process. Thus, this workshop is driven forward by three main questions. First, how can we classify, develop, and utilize analysis and design patterns together towards the path of a problem resolution? Second, what is the-behind-the-language that guides the sewing of patterns together as a whole? And third, how can we overcome and face challenges, other than patterns composition problems (patterns traceability, etc.) that can hinder the development of a system of patterns? The inherent inability to answer these questions detrimentally impacts the understanding of how to put patterns in real practice, and will therefore make software patterns' use more complex than it should.\nTitle:\nThe first international workshop on patterns languages: addressing challenges (PLAC 2007)\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

All of the previous studies assume a fixed order on the attributes in question. However, in some applications, users may be interested in skylines with respect to various total or partial orders on nominal attributes. In this paper, we identify and tackle the problem of online skyline analysis with dynamic preferences on nominal attributes. We investigate how changes of orders in attributes lead to changes of skylines. We address two novel types of interesting queries: a viewpoint query returns with respect to which orders a point is (or is not) in the skylines and an order-based skyline query retrieves the skyline with respect to a specific order. We develop two methods systematically and report an extensive performance study using both synthetic and real data sets to verify their effectiveness and efficiency.\nTitle:\nOnline Skyline Analysis with Dynamic Preferences on Nominal Attributes\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For building a powerful action recognition pipeline it is important that both steps are efficient and in the same time provide reliable performance. This work proposes a new approach for feature extraction and encoding that allows us to obtain real-time frame rate processing for an action recognition system. The motion information represents an important source of information within the video. The common approach to extract the motion information is to compute the optical flow. However, the estimation of optical flow is very demanding in terms of computational cost, in many cases being the most significant processing step within the overall pipeline of the target video analysis application. In this work we propose an efficient approach to capture the motion information within the video. Our proposed descriptor, Histograms of Motion Gradients (HMG), is based on a simple temporal and spatial derivation, which captures the changes between two consecutive frames. For the encoding step a widely adopted method is the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD), which is an efficient encoding method, however, it considers only the difference between local descriptors and their centroids. In this work we propose Shape Difference VLAD (SD-VLAD), an encoding method which brings complementary information by using the shape information within the encoding process. We validated our proposed pipeline for action recognition on three challenging datasets UCF50, UCF101 and HMDB51, and we propose also a real-time framework for action recognition.\nTitle:\nEfficient human action recognition using histograms of motion gradients and VLAD with descriptor shape information.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We approach the problem by developing a set of statistical models for a predefined lexicon. Novel concepts are then mapped in terms of the concepts in the lexicon. To achieve robust detection of concepts, we exploit features from multiple modalities, namely, audio, video, and text. Concept representations are modeled using Gaussian mixtures models (GMM), hid-den Markov models (HMM), and support vector machines (SVM). Models such as Bayesian networks and SVMs are used in a late-fusion approach to model concepts that are not explicitly modeled in terms of features. Our experiments indicate promise in the proposed classification and fusion methodologies: our proposed fusion scheme achieves more than 10% relative improvement over the best unimodal concept detector.

These limitations have motivated the study of classification techniques that build on the foundations of learning theory and statistics. The current paper presents a new statistical classifier that allows real time classification of encrypted data. Our method is based on a hybrid combination of the k-means and k-nearest neighbor (or k-NN) geometrical classifiers. The proposed classifier is both fast and accurate, as implied by our feasibility tests, which included implementing and intergrading statistical classification into a realtime embedded environment.

A well known hierarchical specification model, considered in this work, is that of Lengauer [9, 10] referred to as L-specifications. In this paper we discuss a restriction on the L-specifications resulting to graphs which we call Well-Separated (WS). This class is characterized by a polynomial time (to the size of the specification of the graph) testable combinatorial property.In this work we study the Radiocoloring Problem (RCP) on WS L-specified hierarchical planar graphs. The optimization version of RCP studied here, consists in assigning colors to the vertices of a graph, such that any two vertices of distance at most two get different colors. The objective here is to minimize the number of colors used. This problem is equivalent to the problem of vertex coloring the square of a graph G, G2, where G2 has the same vertex set as G and there is an edge between any two vertices of G2 if their distance in G is at most 2.We first show that RCP is PSPACE-complete for WS L-specified hierarchical planar graphs. Second, we present a polynomial time 3- approximation algorithm as well as a more efficient 4-approximation algorithm for RCP on graphs of this class.We note that, the best currently known approximation ratio for the RCP on ordinary (non-hierarchical) planar graphs of general degree is 2([6, 1]). Note also that the only known results on any kind of coloring problems have been shown for another special kind of hierarchical graphs (unit disk graphs) achieving a 6-approximation solution [13].\nTitle:\nOn Radiocoloring Hierarchically Specified Planar Graphs: PSPACE-Completeness and Approximations\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In the algorithm different learning techniques are applied for the antecedent and the consequent parameters of the fuzzy system. We propose a hybrid method for the antecedent parameters learning based on the combination of the bacterial evolutionary algorithm (BEA) and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method. For the linear parameters in fuzzy systems appearing in the rule consequents the least squares (LS) and the recursive least squares (RLS) techniques are applied, which will lead to a global optimal solution of linear parameter vectors in the least squares sense. Therefore a better performance can be guaranteed than with a complete learning by BEA and LM. The paper is concluded by evaluation results based on high-dimensional test data. These evaluation results compare the new method with some conventional fuzzy training methods with respect to approximation accuracy and model complexity.\nTitle:\nSeparated Antecedent and Consequent Learning for Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic method for activity recognition in a smart home, based on load signatures of appliances. Most recognition approaches rely on distributed and heterogeneous sensors (ex. RFID), which are intrusive require complex installation, deployment and maintenance. On the other hand, most applications of appliance load monitoring (signal analysis) refer to the energy saving and the costs reducing of energy consumption. Consequently, our proposal constitutes an original application and new algorithmic method based on steady-state operations and signatures. The extraction process of load signatures of appliances is carried out in a three-dimensional space through a single power analyzer, which is non-intrusive (NIALM). We have rigorously tested this new approach by conducting an experiment in our smart home prototype by simulating daily scenarios taken from clinical trials previously done with Alzheimer patients. The promising results we obtained are presented and compared to other approaches, showing that, with an exceptionally minimal investment and the exploitation of relatively limited data, our method can efficiently recognize activities of daily living for providing assistive services.\nTitle:\nActivity recognition in smart homes based on electrical devices identification\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

PCST appears in the design of utility networks (eg. fiber optics or district heating) where profit generating customers and the network connecting them have to be chosen in the most profitable way. Our main contribution is an efficient implementation using a directed graph model and connectivity inequalities corresponding to cuts in the graph. This enables us to efficiently separate sets of violated inequalities using a maximum flow algorithm. Our implementation solves all benchmark instances from the literature to optimality, including eight for which the optimum was not known. We also present optimal results on very large real world instances that represent fiber optic networks in a German city.\nTitle:\nSolving the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree Problem to Optimality\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Although knowledge management is often accepted as a very useful organizational activity, a number of the assumptions underlying knowledge management have not been investigated. This paper examines four knowledge management assumptions: knowledge is worth managing, organizations benefit from managing knowledge, knowledge can be managed, and little risk is associated with managing knowledge. The assumptions are analyzed at strategic and operational levels, and both negating and supporting evidence is presented. Based on this analysis, a framework for research in knowledge management is proposed. The framework is used to generate a number of key questions that should be addressed in knowledge management research. Particular attention is given to goals and rewards as well as to the role of information technology in knowledge management.\nTitle:\nConfronting the assumptions underlying the management of knowledge: an agenda for understanding and investigating knowledge management\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Through probability maximization in stochastic programming, the transformed stochastic bilevel programming problem can be reduced to a deterministic bilevel programming problem.

On experimentation with a database of 10000 samples, the maximum recognition rate of 76.86% is observed for handwritten Bangla characters. For Bangla numerals the maximum success rate of 99.45%. is achieved on a database of 12000 sample.

It is based on exploiting the variable independencies with the aim of building a tree structure such that in each leaf all the variables are independent. In this work we produce a structure called Independency tree. This structure can be seen as an extended probability tree, introducing a new and very important element: a list of probabilistic single potentials associated to every node. In the paper we will show that the model can be used to approximate a joint probability distribution and, at the same time, as a hierarchical clustering procedure. The Independency tree can be learned from data and it allows a fast computation of conditional probabilities.\nTitle:\nThe Independency tree model: a new approach for clustering and factorisation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This is particularly true for boolean systems, where BNs often prove to be a more efficient modelling framework than traditional reliability techniques (like fault trees and reliability block diagrams). However, limitations in the BNs\u2019 calculation engine have prevented BNs from becoming equally popular for domains containing mixtures of both discrete and continuous variables (the so-called hybrid domains). In this paper we focus on these difficulties, and summarize some of the last decade's research on inference in hybrid Bayesian networks. The discussions are linked to an example model for estimating human reliability.\nTitle:\nInference in hybrid Bayesian networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It is known to perform very well over the wired Internet where end-to-end performance is almost guaranteed. However, in wireless ad hoc networks, many constraints appear as the scarcity of resources and their shared nature, which make running BitTorrent with its default configuration not lead to best performances. To these constraints it adds the fact that peers are both routers and end-users and that TCP-performance drops seriously with the number of hops. We show in this work that the neighbor selection mechanism in BitTorrent plays an important role in determining the performance of the protocol when deployed over a wireless ad hoc network. It is no longer efficient to choose and treat with peers independently of their location. A first solution is to limit the scope of the neighborhood. In this case, TCP connections are fast but there is no more diversity of pieces in the network: pieces propagate in a unique direction from the seed to distant peers. This prohibits peers from reciprocating data and leads to low sharing ratios and suboptimal utilization of network resources. To recover from these impairments, we propose an enhancement to BitTorrent which aims to minimize the time to download the content and at the same time to enforce cooperation among peers. Our solution considers a restricted neighborhood to reduce routing overhead and to improve throughput, while establishing few connections to remote peers to improve diversity of pieces. With the help of extensive NS-2 simulations, we show that these enhancements to BitTorrent significantly improve the file completion time while fully profiting from the incentives implemented in BitTorrent to enforce fair sharing.\nTitle:\nAdapting BitTorrent to Wireless Ad Hoc Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

MAQSA provides an interactive topic-centric dashboard that summarizes news articles and social activity (e.g., comments and tweets) around them. MAQSA helps editors and publishers in newsrooms understand user engagement and audience sentiment evolution on various topics of interest. It also helps news consumers explore public reaction on articles relevant to a topic and refine their exploration via related entities, topics, articles and tweets. Given a topic, e.g., \"Gulf Oil Spill,\" or \"The Arab Spring\", MAQSA combines three key dimensions: time, geographic location, and topic to generate a detailed activity dashboard around relevant articles. The dashboard contains an annotated comment timeline and a social graph of comments. It utilizes commenters' locations to build maps of comment sentiment and topics by region of the world. Finally, to facilitate exploration, MAQSA provides listings of related entities, articles, and tweets. It algorithmically processes large collections of articles and tweets, and enables the dynamic specification of topics and dates for exploration. In this demo, participants will be invited to explore the social dynamics around articles on oil spills, the Libyan revolution, and the Arab Spring. In addition, participants will be able to define and explore their own topics dynamically.\nTitle:\nMAQSA: a system for social analytics on news\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Microarray-based gene biomarkers have been identified to predict outcome and outperform traditional clinical parameters. However, the robustness of the individual gene biomarkers is questioned because of their little reproducibility between different cohorts of patients. Substantial progress in treatment requires advances in methods to identify robust biomarkers. Several methods incorporating pathway information have been proposed to identify robust pathway markers and build classifiers at the level of functional categories rather than of individual genes. However, current methods consider the pathways as simple gene sets but ignore the pathway topological information, which is essential to infer a more robust pathway activity. Results: Here, we propose a directed random walk (DRW)-based method to infer the pathway activity. DRW evaluates the topological importance of each gene by capturing the structure information embedded in the directed pathway network. The strategy of weighting genes by their topological importance greatly improved the reproducibility of pathway activities. Experiments on 18 cancer datasets showed that the proposed method yielded a more accurate and robust overall performance compared with several existing genebased and pathway-based classification methods. The resulting risk-active pathways are more reliable in guiding therapeutic selection and the development of pathway-specific therapeutic strategies.\nTitle:\nTopologically inferring risk-active pathways toward precise cancer classification by directed random walk.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To ensure that parallel programs run correctly, verification of hardware MCM implementations would ideally be complete; i.e. verified as being correct across all possible executions of all possible programs. However, no existing automated approach is capable of such complete verification.\n\nTo help fill this verification gap, we present PipeProof, a methodology and tool for complete MCM verification of an axiomatic microarchitectural (hardware-level) ordering specification against an axiomatic ISA-level MCM specification. PipeProof can automatically prove a microarchitecture correct in all cases, or return an indication (often a counterexample) that the microarchitecture could not be verified. To accomplish unbounded verification, PipeProof introduces the novel Transitive Chain Abstraction to represent microarchitectural executions of an arbitrary number of instructions using only a small, finite number of instructions. With the help of this abstraction, PipeProof proves microarchitectural correctness using an automatic abstraction refinement approach. PipeProof's implementation also includes algorithmic optimizations which improve runtime by greatly reducing the number of cases considered. As a proof-of-concept study, we present results for modelling and proving correct simple microarchitectures implementing the SC and TSO MCMs. PipeProof verifies both case studies in under an hour, showing that it is indeed possible to automate microarchitectural MCM correctness proofs.\n\n\nTitle:\nPipeProof - Automated Memory Consistency Proofs for Microarchitectural Specifications.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our method does not require any prior information regarding the lighting conditions or the 3D geometries of the underlying faces. We first use a Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)-based deformation technique to align key facial features of the reference 2D face with those of the target face. Then, we employ the LTV model to factorize each of the two aligned face images to an illumination-dependent component and an illumination-invariant component. Finally, illumination transferring is achieved by replacing the illumination-dependent component of the target face by that of the reference face. We tested our technique on numerous grayscale and color face images from various face datasets including the Yale face Database, as well as the application of illumination-preserved face coloring.\nTitle:\nImage-based face illumination transferring using logarithmic total variation models\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

An affine camera model is used for 3-D reconstruction due to its simplicity, linearity, and robustness. A major challenge is that a series of optics is involved in the retinal imaging process, including an actual fundus camera, a digital camera, and the optics of the human eye, all of which cause significant nonlinear distortions in retinal images. In this paper, we develop a new constrained optimization method that considers both the geometric shape of the human retina and nonlinear lens distortions. Moreover, we examine a variety of lens distortion models to approximate the optics of the human eye in order to create a smooth spherical surface for curvature estimation. The experimental results on both synthetic data and real retinal images validate the proposed algorithm.\nTitle:\n3-D Retinal Curvature Estimation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Second, discovery and composition techniques can be used to find implementations, e.g. services (or combinations of services), for the implementation of process activities at modeling time. The discovered implementations allow for mapping the process steps to the IT infrastructure according to several strategies during process configuration, which helps clearly separating modeling from configuration concerns.

A key observation is that the correlation matrix of the received signal can be expressed in terms of DSTM matrices corresponding to the sent information symbols. In this way decision feedback can be inserted into the MSDD metric, yielding a DF-MSDD receiver while maintaining almost the same performance as MSDD.\nTitle:\nDecision-Feedback Multiple-Symbol Differential Detection Of Differential Space-Time Modulation In Continuously Fading Channels\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A successful technique for reducing this number, while still maintaining complete coverage, is Dynamic Partial Order Reduction (DPOR). We present a new DPOR algorithm, which is the first to be provably optimal in that it always explores the minimal number of executions. It is based on a novel class of sets, called source sets, which replace the role of persistent sets in previous algorithms. First, we show how to modify an existing DPOR algorithm to work with source sets, resulting in an efficient and simple to implement algorithm. Second, we extend this algorithm with a novel mechanism, called wakeup trees, that allows to achieve optimality. We have implemented both algorithms in a stateless model checking tool for Erlang programs. Experiments show that source sets significantly increase the performance and that wakeup trees incur only a small overhead in both time and space.\nTitle:\nOptimal dynamic partial order reduction\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The SBI dataset refers to more general scene modeling problems - as for video segmentation, compression or editing - where video sequences may be generally short, and often include foreground objects occupying a large portion on the image for the majority of the sequence.

In this context, we recently proposed to deal with the associated optimization problem from a purely discrete point of view, using the notion of discrete rigid transformation (DRT) graph. In particular, a local search scheme within the DRT graph to compute a locally optimal solution without any numerical approximation was formerly proposed. In this article, we extend this study, with the purpose to reduce the algorithmic complexity of the proposed optimization scheme. To this end, we propose a novel algorithmic framework for just-in-time computation of sub-graphs of interest within the DRT graph.

This is designed to quantify highly connectedness of substructures in a sparse directed graph such as the web graph. We study the optimization problems of finding subgraphs maximizing these notions of density for undirected and directed graphs. This paper gives simple greedy approximation algorithms for these optimization problems.

Previously, researchers have developed two types of supervised learning approaches for extracting web data: methods that create precise, site-specific extraction rules and methods that learn less-precise site-independent extraction rules. In either case, significant training is required. In this paper, we describe a third, more ambitious approach, where we use unsupervised learning to analyze sites and discover their structure. Our method relies on a set of heterogeneous \"experts\", each of which is capable of identifying certain types of generic structure. Each expert represents its discoveries as \"hints\". Based on these hints, our system clusters the pages and identifies semi-structured data that can be extracted. To identify a good clustering, we use a probabilistic model of the hint-generation process. The paper describes our formulation of the fully-automatic web-extraction problem, our clustering approach, and our results on a set of experiments.\nTitle:\nAutoFeed: an unsupervised learning system for generating webfeeds\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Recent advances in neuroscience indicate that multiple brain regions can be activated during motor imagery. The signal propagation among the regions can give rise to spurious effects in identifying event-related desynchronization/synchronization for discriminative motor imagery detection in conventional feature extraction methods. Particularly, we propose that computational models which account for both signal propagation and volume conduction effects of the source neuronal activities can more accurately describe EEG during the specific brain activities and lead to more effective feature extraction. To this end, we devise a unified model for joint learning of signal propagation and spatial patterns. The preliminary results obtained with real-world motor imagery EEG data sets confirm that the new methodology can improve classification accuracy with statistical significance.\nTitle:\nJoint Spatial-Temporal Filter Design For Analysis Of Motor Imagery Eeg\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Furthermore, although there have been various proposals for logics of partial functions, there is no consensus on which is ''the right'' logic to use for verification applications. In this paper, we propose using a three-valued Kleene logic, where partial functions return the ''undefined'' value when applied outside of their domains. The particular semantics are chosen according to the principle of least surprise to the user; if there is disagreement among the various approaches on what the value of the formula should be, its evaluation is undefined. We show that the problem of checking validity in the three-valued logic can be reduced to checking validity in a standard two-valued logic, and describe how this approach has been successfully implemented in our tool, CVC Lite.\nTitle:\nA Practical Approach to Partial Functions in CVC Lite\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To develop the model, we've conducted two experiments that explore the relationships between the physical parameters used to describe the reflectance properties of glossy surfaces and the perceptual dimensions of glossy appearance. In the first experiment we use multidimensional scaling techniques to reveal the dimensionality of gloss perception for simulated painted surfaces. In the second experiment we use magnitude estimation methods to place metrics on these dimensions that relate changes in apparent gloss to variations in surface reflectance properties. We use the results of these experiments to rewrite the parameters of a physically-based light reflection model in perceptual terms. The result is a new psychophysically-based light reflection model where the dimensions of the model are perceptually meaningful, and variations along the dimensions are perceptually uniform. We demonstrate that the model can facilitate describing surface gloss in graphics rendering applications.

Their closed-form mean square deviation (MSD) expressions for the transient and steady-state regimes are derived. Additionally, bounds on the step-size which guarantee mean square stability are given. It is found that the step-size bound and transient behavior of the LMS and the steady-state MSD of the NLMS depend on the kurtosis of the input signal. Convergence rates and steady-state MSDs of the two algorithms are then compared, which shows that the normalized variant with a large step-size would offer faster convergence rate than the LMS scheme. However, when small step-sizes are employed, the LMS achieves lower steady-state MSD than the NLMS at the same convergence rate.\nTitle:\nMean square deviation analysis of LMS and NLMS algorithms with white reference inputs.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Recently more and more researchers have attempted to solve the problems of partial retrieval in the domain of computer graphics, vision, CAD, and multimedia. Unfortunately, in the literature, there is little comprehensive discussion on the state-of-the-art methods of partial shape retrieval. In this article we focus on reviewing the partial shape retrieval methods over the last decade, and help novices to grasp latest developments in this field. We first give the definition of partial retrieval and discuss its desirable capabilities. Secondly, we classify the existing methods on partial shape retrieval into three classes by several criteria, describe the main ideas and techniques for each class, and detailedly compare their advantages and limits. We also present several relevant 3D datasets and corresponding evaluation metrics, which are necessary for evaluating partial retrieval performance. Finally, we discuss possible research directions to address partial shape retrieval.\nTitle:\nA survey on partial retrieval of 3D shapes\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In order to examine the feasibility of our approach, we have developed a parallel interaction library, named PIEL (Parallel Interactive Editing Library).

Next, a generalized multiple access setting with confidential messages is considered in which each user wishes to communicate secret information to a common destination without the other determining its message. In this latter situation, outer bounds on the secrecy capacity are obtained.\nTitle:\n\\ Secrecy Capacity Of Semi-Deterministic Wire-Tap Channels\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A connectome is a complete map of a neuronal system, comprising all neuronal connections between its structures. The term \"connectome\" is close to the word \"genome\" and implies completeness of all neuronal connections, in the same way as a genome is a complete listing of all nucleotide sequences. The goal of connectomics is to create a complete representation of the brain's wiring. Such a representation is believed to increase our understanding of how functional brain states emerge from their underlying anatomical structure. Furthermore, it can provide important information for the cure of neuronal dysfunctions like schizophrenia or autism. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art of visualization and image processing techniques in the field of connectomics and describe some remaining challenges. \nTitle:\nVisualization in Connectomics\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The domain of the transfer function is typically the one-dimensional space of scalar data values. This paper advances the use of curvature information in multi-dimensional transfer functions, with a methodology for computing high-quality curvature measurements. The proposed methodology combines an implicit formulation of curvature with convolution-based reconstruction of the field. We give concrete guidelines for implementing the methodology, and illustrate the importance of choosing accurate filters for computing derivatives with convolution. Curvature-based transfer functions are shown to extend the expressivity and utility of volume rendering through contributions in three different application areas: non-photorealistic volume rendering, surface smoothing via anisotropic diffusion, and visualization of isosurface uncertainty.\nTitle:\nCurvature-Based Transfer Functions for Direct Volume Rendering: Methods and Applications\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To this end, we formulate an approximate Bayesian inference framework on undirected graphs using mean field approximation (MFA). Mean field networks are used for inference based on the interpretation that iterations of MFA can be seen as feed-forward operations in a neural network. This allows us to learn the model parameters from training data using back-propagation algorithm. We demonstrate usefulness of the model to extract airway trees from 3D chest CT data. We first obtain probability images using a voxel classifier that distinguishes airways from background and use Bayesian smoothing to model individual airway branches. This yields us joint Gaussian density estimates of position, orientation and scale as node features of the input graph. Performance of the method is compared with two methods: the first uses probability images from a trained voxel classifier with region growing, which is similar to one of the best performing methods at EXACT'09 airway challenge, and the second method is based on Bayesian smoothing on these probability images. Using centerline distance as error measure the presented method shows significant improvement compared to these two methods.\nTitle:\nMean Field Network based Graph Refinement with application to Airway Tree Extraction.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

These granular worlds are defined on the same universe of discourse, but employ different granulations of this universe. In order to translate information from one granular world to the other, we must regranulate the information so that it matches the information granularity of the target world. This is accomplished through the use of a first-order interpolation algorithm, implemented using linguistic arithmetic, a set of elementary granular computing operations. We first demonstrate this algorithm by studying the common \u201cfuzzy-PD\u201d rulebase at several different granularities, and conclude that the \u201c3\u00d73\u201d granulation may be too coarse for this objective.

As our Web middleware coordinates various sources, each source access incurs network communication and server computation.

But due to the amount, variety and volatile nature of information accessible over the Internet extended query capabilities are crucial. We show how to efficiently perform distributed skyline queries and thus essentially extend the expressiveness of querying today's Web information systems. Together with our innovative retrieval algorithm we also present useful heuristics to further speed up the retrieval in most practical cases paving the road towards meeting even the real-time challenges of on-line information services. We discuss performance evaluations and point to open problems in the concept and application of skylining in modem information systems. For the curse of dimensionality, an intrinsic problem in skyline queries, we propose a novel sampling scheme that allows to get an early impression of the skyline for subsequent query refinement.\nTitle:\nEfficient Distributed Skylining for Web Information Systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Previous methods for dynamic slicing only considered languages without procedures and procedure calls. This method generates summary information for each procedure call and represents a program as a summary graph of dynamic dependencies. A slice on this graph consists of nodes for all procedure calls of the program that affect the value of a given variable. The size of the information saved by this method is considerably smaller than what is needed by previous methods for dynamic slicing [AH90], since it only depends on the size of the program's execution tree, i.e. the number of executed procedure calls, which is much smaller than the size of a trace of all executed statements. In addition, work space for the temporary graph is needed, proportional to the maximum sum of the sizes of simultaneously active procedures. A program slice can be produced from the interprocedural slice on the graph if a suitable definition of control dependency is used when the summary graph is constructed. The interprocedural dynamic slicing introduced in this paper is being used to improve the bug localization properties of the Generalized Algorithmic Debugging Technique [FGKS91], a method for declarative semi-automatic debugging.\nTitle:\nInterprocedural Dynamic Slicing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We theoretically demonstrate that two commonly observed properties of social networks, heavy-tailed degree distributions and large clustering coefficients, imply the existence of vertex neighborhoods (also known as egonets) that are themselves good communities. We evaluate these neighborhood communities on a range of graphs. What we find is that the neighborhood communities can exhibit conductance scores that are as good as the Fiedler cut. Also, the conductance of neighborhood communities shows similar behavior as the network community profile computed with a personalized PageRank community detection method. Neighborhood communities give us a simple and powerful heuristic for speeding up local partitioning methods. Since finding good seeds for the PageRank clustering method is difficult, most approaches involve an expensive sweep over a great many starting vertices. We show how to use neighborhood communities to quickly generate a small set of seeds.\nTitle:\nVertex neighborhoods, low conductance cuts, and good seeds for local community methods\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Given a large graph, how can we find its most \\\"important\\\" structures, so that we can summarize it and easily visualize it? How can we measure the \\\"importance\\\" of a set of discovered subgraphs in a large graph? Starting with the observation that real graphs often consist of stars, bipartite cores, cliques, and chains, our main idea is to find the most succinct description of a graph in these \\\"vocabulary\\\" terms. To this end, we first mine candidate subgraphs using one or more graph partitioning algorithms. Next, we identify the optimal summarization using the minimum description length MDL principle, picking only those subgraphs from the candidates that together yield the best lossless compression of the graph-or, equivalently, that most succinctly describe its adjacency matrix.\nTitle:\nSummarizing and understanding large graphs\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Frequent item set mining attempts this, but low support levels often result in exorbitant amounts of item sets. Recently we showed that by using MDL we are able to select a small number of item sets that compress the data well [11]. Here we show that this small set is a good approximation of the underlying data distribution. Using the small set in a MDL-based classifier leads to performance on par with well-known rule-induction and association-rule based methods. Advantages are that no parameters need to be set manually and only very few item sets are used. The classification scores indicate that selecting item sets through compression is an elegant way of mining interesting patterns that can subsequently find use in many applications.\nTitle:\nCompression picks item sets that matter\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The VM's power consumption with network transactions, however, has seldom been examined. This paper presents an empirical study on the power consumption of typical virtualization packages while performing network tasks. We find that both Hardware Virtualization and Paravirtualization add considerable energy overhead, affecting both sending and receiving, and a busy virtualized web-server may consume 40% more energy than its non-virtualized counterparts. Our detailed profiling on packet path reveals that a VM can take 5 times more cycles to deliver a packet than a bare-metal machine, and is also much less efficient on caching. Without fundamental changes to the hypervisor-based VM architecture, we show that the use of adaptive packet buffering potentially reduces the overhead. Its practicality and effectiveness in power saving are validated through driver-level implementation and experiments.\nTitle:\nPower consumption of virtual machines with network transactions: Measurement and improvements\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm for deforming geometric textures with dynamic effects. The algorithm consists of two steps. First, it computes a deformed shell space by optimizing a material related energy function, which is then used to evaluate the equilibrium position of the geometric texture. Second, an explicit time integration scheme is applied for vibrating the geometric texture around its equilibrium position. Users can deform the geometric textures by dragging its vertices directly, and the dynamic behavior of the geometric textures can be changed by adjusting several material parameters. The dynamic simulation of geometric textures can be easily implemented on GPU and runs at real-time rates. Copyright \u00a9 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. In this paper we introduce a real-time two step method for deforming geometric textures with dynamic effects. The major technical contributions include a shell deformation method which is aware of Poisson's ratio and a vibration simulation algorithm for geometric textures which support variant effects. The simulation can be both driven by an animation sequence of the base mesh or directly manipulating the geometric textures. Dynamic effects of geometric textures can be simulated efficiently by our two-step scheme. In the left, we render the base mesh as a green solid, and the offset mesh as a translucent surface. The right figure shows one frame of the dynamic deformation of the geometric textures which are embedded between them.\nTitle:\nReal-time dynamics for geometric textures in shell\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We embed this metric into a hierarchical registration framework, where we show that registration robustness and accuracy can be improved by adapting both the similarity metric and the pixel selection strategy to the Gaussian blurring scale and to the modalities being registered. A computationally efficient estimation of gradient orientations is proposed based on patch-wise rigidity.We have applied our method to both rigid and nonrigidmultimodal registration taskswith differentmodalities.Our approach outperforms mutual information (MI) and previously proposed local approximations of MI for multimodal (e.g. CT/MRI) brain image registration tasks. Furthermore, it shows significant improvements in terms of mTRE over standard methods in the highly challenging clinical context of registering pre-operative brain MRI to intra-operative US images.\nTitle:\nHierarchical multimodal image registration based on adaptive local mutual information\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For reconstructing buildings it is easy to obtain large numbers of photos representing complete, all-around coverage of a building; however, such large photos collections are often unordered and unorganized, with unknown viewpoints. We present a method for reconstructing piecewise planar building models based on a near-linear time process that sorts such unorganized collections, quickly creating an image graph, an initial pose for each camera, and a piecewise-planar facade model. Our sorting technique first estimates single-view, piecewise planar geometry from each photo, then merges these single-view models together in an analysis phase that reasons about the global scene geometry. A key contribution of our technique is to perform this reasoning based on a number of typical constraints of buildings. This sorting process results in a piecewise planar model of the scene, a set of good initial camera poses, and a correspondence between photos. This information is useful in itself as an approximate scene model, but also represents a good initialization for structure from motion and multi-view stereo techniques from which refined models can be derived, at greatly reduced computational cost compared to prior techniques.\nTitle:\nSorting unorganized photo sets for urban reconstruction\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This paper goes further into implementation details and experiments related to the basic scheme to support fault-tolerance which is critical for overall performance.

Dynamic composition of services on the fly requires mechanisms for ensuring that the component services in the composition are compatible with each other. Current service composition languages provide notations for describing the interactions among component services. However, they focus only on the compatibility at the syntax and semantic level in an informal way, yet ignoring the dynamic behavior within services. This paper emphasizes the importance of the behavior in the compatibility verification between services and utilizes the \u03c0-calculus to model the service behavior and the interaction in a formal way. Based on the formalization, it proposes a method based on the operational semantics of the \u03c0-calculus to automate the verification of compatibility between two services and presents an algorithm to measure the compatibility degree quantitatively.\nTitle:\nModeling service compatibility with pi-calculus for choreography\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Conducting an evaluation while drawing partial user attention is a challenging problem. Many normal information visualization evaluation methods (full attention) may not suit the evaluation of ambient displays. Inspired by concepts in the social and behavioral science, we categorize the evaluation of ambient displays into two methodologies: intrusive and non-intrusive. The major difference between these two approaches is the level of user involvement, as an intrusive evaluation requires a higher user involvement than a non-intrusive evaluation. Based on our long-term (5 months) non-intrusive evaluation of Fisherman presented in [16], this paper provides a detailed discussion of the actual technical and experimental setup of unobtrusively measurement of user gaze over a long period by using a face-tracking camera and IR sensors. In addition, this paper also demonstrates a solution to the ethical problem of using video cameras to collect data in a semi-public place.

Furthermore, we suggest an algorithm to determine whether or not a given regular language is prefix-free.\nTitle:\nPrefix-free regular languages and pattern matching\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A recent survey [20] has provided a detailed comparison of various fusion methods on Deep Web data. In this paper, we study the applicability and limitations of different fusion techniques on a more challenging problem: knowledge fusion. Knowledge fusion identifies true subject-predicate-object triples extracted by multiple information extractors from multiple information sources. These extractors perform the tasks of entity linkage and schema alignment, thus introducing an additional source of noise that is quite different from that traditionally considered in the data fusion literature, which only focuses on factual errors in the original sources. We adapt state-of-the-art data fusion techniques and apply them to a knowledge base with 1.6B unique knowledge triples extracted by 12 extractors from over 1B Web pages, which is three orders of magnitude larger than the data sets used in previous data fusion papers. We show great promise of the data fusion approaches in solving the knowledge fusion problem, and suggest interesting research directions through a detailed error analysis of the methods.\nTitle:\nFrom Data Fusion to Knowledge Fusion.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This problem is particularly difficult when there is only one single image of the subject available and it was taken under a harsh lighting condition. Recent research demonstrates that the set of images of a convex Lambertian object obtained under a wide variety of lighting conditions can be approximated accurately by a low-dimensional linear subspace using spherical harmonic representation. However, the approximation error can be large under harsh lighting conditions [2] thus making it difficult to recover albedo information. In order to address this problem, we propose a subregion based framework that uses a Markov Random Field to model the statistical distribution and spatial coherence of face texture, which makes our approach not only robust to harsh lighting conditions, but insensitive to partial occlusions as well. The performance of our framework is demonstrated through various experimental results, including the improvement to the face recognition rate under harsh lighting conditions.\nTitle:\nFace Re-Lighting From A Single Image Under Harsh Lighting Conditions\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we propose an authentication scheme for adapted H.264 video content to detect integrity at the receiver's side without the need for cascaded operations. The proposed scheme utilizes MPEG- 21 gBSD for hard authentication of H.264 video in the compressed domain and does not necessitate any cascaded decompression and recompression. The design uses content- based authentication which is derived from a hash value. The authentication data is embedded as a fragile watermark, and the marking space is selected during the adaptation process of the H.264 video by parsing the gBSD. The authentication information is embedded in already encoded videos during adaptation. Proof of concept and performance evaluation is also presented.\nTitle:\nHard Authentication of H.264 Video Applying MPEG-21 Generic Bitstream Syntax Description (gBSD)\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Network representation learning aims at learning distributed vector representation for each vertex in a network, which is also increasingly recognized as an important aspect for network analysis. Most network representation learning methods investigate network structures for learning. In reality, network vertices contain rich information (such as text), which cannot be well applied with algorithmic frameworks of typical representation learning methods. By proving that DeepWalk, a state-of-the-art network representation method, is actually equivalent to matrix factorization (MF), we propose text-associated DeepWalk (TADW). TADW incorporates text features of vertices into network representation learning under the framework of matrix factorization. We evaluate our method and various baseline methods by applying them to the task of multi-class classification of vertices. The experimental results show that, our method outperforms other baselines on all three datasets, especially when networks are noisy and training ratio is small. The source code of this paper can be obtained from https://github.com/albertyang33/TADW.\nTitle:\nNetwork representation learning with rich text information\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Despite its short key size, it is used in remote keyless entry systems and other wireless authentication applications. For example, there are indications that authentication protocols based on KeeLoq are used, or were used by various car manufacturers in anti-theft mechanisms. This paper presents a practical key recovery attack against KeeLoq that requires 216 known plaintexts and has a time complexity of 244.5 KeeLoq encryptions. It is based on the principle of slide attacks and a novel approach to meet-in-the-middle attacks. We investigated the way KeeLoq is intended to be used in practice and conclude that our attack can be used to subvert the security of real systems. In some scenarios the adversary may even reveal the master secret used in an entire class of devices from attacking a single device. Our attack has been fully implemented. We have built a device that can obtain the data required for the attack in less than 100 minutes, and our software experiments show that, given the data, the key can be found in 7.8 days of calculations on 64 CPU cores.\nTitle:\nA Practical Attack on KeeLoq\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In a typical scenario there are hundreds of samples taken from remains that must be matched to the pedigrees of the alleged victim's surviving relatives. Moreover the samples are often degraded due to heat and exposure. To develop a competent method for this type of forensic inference problem, the complicated quality issues of DNA typing need to be handled appropriately, the matches between every sample and every family must be considered, and the confidence of matches need to be provided.We present a unified probabilistic framework that efficiently clusters samples, conservatively eliminates implausible sample-pedigree pairings, and handles both degraded samples (missing values) and experimental errors in producing and/or reading a genotype. We present a method that confidently exclude forensically unambiguous sample-family matches from the large hypothesis space of candidate matches, based on posterior probabilistic inference. Due to the high confidentiality of disaster DNA data, simulation experiments are commonly performed and used here for validation. Our framework is shown to be robust to these errors at levels typical in real applications. Furthermore, the flexibility in the probabilistic models makes it possible to extend this framework to include other biological factors such as interdependent markers, mitochondrial sequences, and blood type.The software and data sets are available from the authors upon request.\nTitle:\nInterpreting anonymous DNA samples from mass disasters--probabilistic forensic inference using genetic markers.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Although trajectory tracking is a well-studied topic in computer vision, so far most attention has been devoted to improving the accuracy of trajectory tracking, rather than the efficiency. To our knowledge, LiveTraj is the first that achieves real-time efficiency in trajectory tracking, which can be a key enabler in many important applications such as video surveillance, action recognition and robotics. LiveTraj is based on a state-of-the-art approach to (offline) trajectory tracking; its main innovation is to adapt this base solution to run on an elastic cloud platform to achieve real-time tracking speed at an affordable cost. The video demo shows the offline base solution and LiveTraj side by side, both running on a video stream containing human actions. Besides demonstrating the real-time efficiency of LiveTraj, our video demo also exhibits important system parameters to the audience such as latency and cloud resource usage for different components of the system. Further, if the conference venue provides sufficiently fast Internet connection to our cloud platform, we also plan to demonstrate LiveTraj on-site, during which we will show LiveTraj identifying and tracking trajectories from a live video stream captured by a camera.\nTitle:\nLiveTraj: Real-Time Trajectory Tracking over Live Video Streams\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We compare FO(C) to E-disjunctive logic programming with the stable semantics, and define a fragment on which both semantics coincide.

Moreover, to better represent the relationship among relevant event mentions and the relationship between an event mention and its arguments in a discourse, this paper introduces various kinds of corpus-based and discourse-based constraints in the joint model, either automatically learned or linguistically motivated.

In this paper, we propose a new metric, the drain rate, to forecast the lifetime of nodes according to current traffic conditions. This metric is combined with the value of the remaining battery capacity to determine which nodes can be part of an active route. We describe new route selection mechanisms for MANET routing protocols, which we call the minimum drain rate (MDR) and the conditional minimum drain rate (CMDR). MDR extends nodal battery life and the duration of paths, while CMDR also minimizes the total transmission energy consumed per packet. Using the ns-2 simulator and the dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol, we compare MDR and CMDR against prior proposals for energy-aware routing and show that using the drain rate for energy-aware route selection offers superior performance results.

The task of multiple active contours is framed as a partitioning problem by assuming that image data are generated from a finite mixture model with unknown number of components. Then, the partitioning problem is solved within a divisive graph cut framework where multi-way minimum cuts for multiple contours are efficiently computed in a top-down way through a swap move of binary labels. A split move is integrated into the swap move within that framework to estimate the model parameters associated with regions without the use of initial contours and seed points. The number of regions is also estimated as a part of the algorithm. Experimental results of boundary and region detection of natural images are presented and analyzed with precision and recall measures to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\nTitle:\nA new graph cut-based multiple active contour algorithm without initial contours and seed points\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We present a new approach to translating XPATH queries into SQL queries with a simple least fixpoint (LFP) operator, which is already supported by most commercial RDBMS. The approach is based on our algorithm for rewriting XPATH queries into regular XPATH expressions, which are capable of capturing both DTD recursion and XPATH queries in a uniform framework. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm for translating regular XPATH queries to SQL queries with LFP, and optimization techniques for minimizing the use of the LFP operator. The novelty of our approach consists in its capability to answer a large class of XPATH queries by means of only low-end RDBMS features already available in most RDBMS. Our experimental results verify the effectiveness of our techniques.\nTitle:\nQuery Translation from XPath to SQL in the Presence of Recursive DTDs\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Up to now, these very powerful attacks have been illustrated on simple devices which leakage was obvious. On more advanced targets, such as high-end processors of smartphones, a simple visual analysis of the waveforms might not be sufficient to read the secret at once. In this paper, we detail and explain how a composition of time-frequency pre-processings manages to extract the relevant information from one signal capture of an asymmetric cryptographic operation (RSA and ECC) running on an Android system. The lesson is that side-channel countermeasures must be applied even on advanced platforms such as smartphones to prevent secret information theft through the electromagnetic (EM) waveforms.\nTitle:\nA Pre-processing Composition for Secret Key Recovery on Android Smartphone.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Thus, the group-based trust value should be called \"reputation rank\". But, unfortunately, most group-based trust metrics are vulnerable to the attack of front peers, which represent these malicious colluding peers always cooperate with others in order to increase their reputation, and then provide misinformation to promote actively malicious peers. In this paper, we proposed adaptive spreading activation approach to mitigating the effect of front peer attack, in which adaptive spreading factor is used to reflect the peer's recommendation ability according to behaviors of the peer's direct/indirect children in trust network; Simulation results show that the adaptive spreading activation approach can identify and mitigate the attack of front peer.\nTitle:\nAn adaptive spreading activation approach to combating the front-peer attack in trust and reputation system\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Understanding the dialogue between users and such technology is crucial to the success of future urban computing deployments. We investigate human behaviour in public spaces using a public photography service deployed on interactive public displays in an urban city. Through the analysis of user-generated snapshots we show that the service was rapidly appropriated outside its intended purpose, resulting in use that differs substantially from those previously documented in photography literature. We reflect on the reasons why the service was appropriated in this way and explore the evolution of photography in urban contexts. Ultimately, our findings help ground our understanding of human behaviour in urban spaces and thus contribute to the design of future Ubicomp deployments.\nTitle:\nLife through the lens: a qualitative investigation of human behaviour with an urban photography service\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we consider a setting where mobile robots must acquire visual information using standard cameras, while minimizing associated movement costs. The main source of complexity for such scenario is the lack of a priori knowledge of 3D structures for the surrounding environment. To address this problem, we propose a novel descriptor for visual coverage that aims at measuring the orientation dependent visual information of an area, based on a regular discretization of the 3D environment in voxels. Next, we use the proposed visual descriptor to define an autonomous cooperative exploration approach, which controls the robot movements so to maximize information accuracy and minimizing movement costs. We empirically evaluate our approach in a simulation scenario based on real data for large scale 3D environments, and on widely used robotic tools (such as ROS and Stage). Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms a baseline random approach and an uncoordinated one, thus being a valid proposal for visual coverage in large scale outdoor scenarios.\nTitle:\nA directional visual descriptor for large-scale coverage problems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Cutaneous cues provide less transparency than kinesthetic force feedback but they do not affect the stability of the teleoperation system. On the other hand, kinesthesia provides a realistic illusion of telepresence but it affects the stability of the haptic loop. Several well-established control techniques ensure a stable interaction by scaling down force feedback as and when required, in order to satisfy the controller stability conditions (e.g., passivity). We here discuss the feasibility of a novel approach to improve the realism of the haptic rendering while preserving its stability: can cutaneous stimuli be employed to compensate for the lack of kinesthetic feedback required to guarantee the stability of the teleoperation loop? We carried out two experiments to evaluate the role of cutaneous cues in teleoperation and the performance improvement rate when compensating a lack of kinesthesia with cutaneous force. Results showed improved performance while employing the aforementioned compensation technique and a high comfort in using the proposed system.\nTitle:\nOn the role of cutaneous force in teleoperation: subtracting kinesthesia from complete haptic feedback\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To overcome this difficulty, the main contribution of our work consist in trying to satisfy as much as possible users' preferences while taking into consideration their availabilities, and this through a new approach based on the distributed reinforcement of arc consistency (DRAC) model.

First, we evaluate traditional well-known weighting models in the text retrieval domain, such as BM25, TFIDF and Language Model (LM), for context-based image retrieval. Second, we evaluate statistical-based feedback models and ontology-based feedback models. Third, we investigate how content-based image retrieval can be integrated with these two basic technologies in traditional text retrieval domain. The experimental results have shown that: 1) traditional weighting models work well in context-based medical image retrieval task especially when the parameters are tuned properly; 2) statistical-based feedback models can further improve the retrieval performance when a small number of documents are used for feedback; however, the medical image retrieval can not benefit from ontology-based query expansion method used in this paper; 3) the retrieval performance can be slightly boosted via an integrated retrieval approach.\nTitle:\nAn integrated approach for medical image retrieval through combining textual and visual features\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Both steps are critical and need to be designed carefully to deal with the particular statistical characteristics of both signal and noise. Optimal design of the filter and the classifier are typically aborded in a separated way, thus leading to suboptimal classification schemes. This paper proposes an efficient methodology to learn an optimal signal filter and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier jointly. In particular, we derive algorithms to solve the optimization problem, prove its theoretical convergence, and discuss different filter regularizers for automated scaling and selection of the feature channels. The latter gives rise to different formulations with the appealing properties of sparseness and noise-robustness. We illustrate the performance of the method in several problems. First, linear and nonlinear toy classification examples, under the presence of both Gaussian and convolutional noise, show the robustness of the proposed methods. The approach is then evaluated on two challenging real life datasets: BCI time series classification and multispectral image segmentation. In all the examples, large margin filtering shows competitive classification performances while offering the advantage of interpretability of the filtered channels retrieved.\nTitle:\nLarge Margin Filtering\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The spread of fake news and mitigation events within the network is modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process with additional exogenous control terms. By choosing a feature representation of states, defining mitigation actions and constructing reward functions to measure the effectiveness of mitigation activities, we map the problem of fake news mitigation into the reinforcement learning framework. We develop a policy iteration method unique to the multivariate networked point process, with the goal of optimizing the actions for maximal total reward under budget constraints. Our method shows promising performance in real-time intervention experiments on a Twitter network to mitigate a surrogate fake news campaign, and outperforms alternatives on synthetic datasets.\nTitle:\nFake News Mitigation via Point Process Based Intervention.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We introduce and investigate the concept of workflow signatures. Not only can these signatures be used to ensure authenticity and protect integrity of workflow data, but also to prove the sequence and logical relationships, such as AND-join and AND-split, of a workflow. Hence, workflow signatures can be electronic evidence useful for auditing, that is proving compliance of business processes against some regulatory requirements. Furthermore, signing keys can be used to grant permissions to perform tasks. Since the signing keys are issued on-the-fly, authorization to execute a task within a workflow can be controlled and granted dynamically at runtime. In this paper, we propose a concrete workflow signature scheme, which is based on hierarchical identity-based cryptography, to meet security properties required by interorganizational workflows.\nTitle:\nWorkflow Signatures for Business Process Compliance\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For a fixed graph H the H-free Star System problem is a variant of the Star System problem where it is asked whether a given set system is realizable by closed neighborhoods of a graph containing no H as an induced subgraph. We study the computational complexity of the H-free Star System problem. We prove that when H is a path or a cycle on at most four vertices the problem is polynomial time solvable. In complement to this result, we show that if H belongs to a certain large class of graphs the H-free Star System problem is NP-complete. In particular, the problem is NP-complete when H is either a cycle or a path on at least five vertices. This yields a complete dichotomy for paths and cycles.

The parallelism exhibited in kernel summation suggests performance improvement when running on GPGPU. State of the art GPU solutions apply cuBLAS library but cannot exploit much of the data locality because intermediate results are written back to main memory in between key operations. This paper presents an optimized implementation that yields better performance and high energy efficiency. Our contributions are fusing all steps of kernel summation into the matrix multiplication code structure and optimizing memory access ordering to make good use of shared memory and cache hierarchy. We decompose the kernel summation problem into individual tasks with few dependencies and strike a balance between finer grained parallelism and reduced data replication. Based on hardware characteristics, we map threads to matrix elements in an interleaved way, and reposition matrix elements to avoid shared memory load and store bank conflicts. We also apply double buffering to hide memory access latency. We analyze both performance and energy benefits of our fused kernel summation compared with the implementation based on cuBLAS. We show that in low dimensions our approach achieves a speedup of up to 1.8X, and saves up to 33% of total energy in all tested problem sizes.\nTitle:\nOptimizing GPGPU Kernel Summation for Performance and Energy Efficiency\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Labeled and unlabeled data are rep- resented as vertices in a weighted graph, with edge weights encoding the similarity between in- stances. The learning problem is then formulated in terms of a Gaussian random field on this graph, where the mean of the field is characterized in terms of harmonic functions, and is efficiently obtained using matrix methods or belief propa- gation. The resulting learning algorithms have intimate connections with random walks, elec- tric networks, and spectral graph theory. We dis- cuss methods to incorporate class priors and the predictions of classifiers obtained by supervised learning. We also propose a method of parameter learning by entropy minimization, and show the algorithm's ability to perform feature selection. Promising experimental results are presented for synthetic data, digit classification, and text clas- sification tasks.\nTitle:\nSemi-Supervised Learning Using Gaussian Fields and Harmonic Functions\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

An effective approach to this problem is to explicitly model the possible aspects underlying a query, in order to maximise the estimated relevance of the retrieved documents with respect to the different aspects. However, such aspects themselves may represent information needs with rather distinct intents (e.g., informational or navigational). Hence, a diverse ranking could benefit from applying intent-aware retrieval models when estimating the relevance of documents to different aspects. In this paper, we propose to diversify the results retrieved for a given query, by learning the appropriateness of different retrieval models for each of the aspects underlying this query. Thorough experiments within the evaluation framework provided by the diversity task of the TREC 2009 and 2010 Web tracks show that the proposed approach can significantly improve state-of-the-art diversification approaches.\nTitle:\nIntent-aware search result diversification\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The viewpoints are represented by their respective bag-of-features vectors and image retrieval techniques are applied to determine the most likely pose of query images at very low computational complexity. As virtual image locations and orientations are decoupled from actual image locations, the system is able to work with sparse reference imagery and copes well with perspective distortion.

Based on this framework, Okamoto first proposed a receipt-free voting scheme [30] for large scale elections. However, in the following paper, Okamoto [31] proved that the scheme [30] was not receipt-free and presented two improved schemes. One scheme requires the help of the parameter registration committee and the other needs a stronger physical assumption of the voting booth. In this paper, we utilize the double-trapdoor commitment to propose a new receipt-free voting scheme based on blind signatures for large scale elections. Neither the parameter registration committee nor the voting booth is required in our scheme. We also present a more efficient zero-knowledge proof for secret permutation. Therefore, our scheme is much more efficient than Okamoto's schemes [30,31] with the weaker physical assumptions. Moreover, we prove that our scheme can achieve the desired security properties.\nTitle:\nNew receipt-free voting scheme using double-trapdoor commitment\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, due to their complexity, these systems are prone to failures and vulnerable to a wide range of cyber-attacks. Current solutions focus either on the infrastructure itself or on mission analysis, but fail to consider information about the complex interdependencies existing between system components and mission tasks. In this paper, we take a different approach, and present a solution for deploying mission tasks in a distributed computing environment in a way that minimizes a mission's exposure to vulnerabilities by taking into account available information about vulnerabilities and dependencies. We model the mission deployment problem as a task allocation problem, subject to various dependability constraints. The proposed solution is based on the A* algorithm for searching the solution space, but we also introduce a heuristic to significantly improve the search performance. We validate our approach, and show that our algorithm scales linearly with the size of both missions and networks.\nTitle:\nReliable mission deployment in vulnerable distributed systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

With in-place learning, there is no need for a separate learning network. We present in this paper a multiple-layer in-place learning network (MILN) for learning positional and scale invariance. The network enables both unsupervised and supervised learning to occur concurrently. When supervision is available (e.g., from the environment during autonomous development), the network performs supervised learning through its multiple layers. When supervision is not available, the network practices while using its own practice motor signal as self-supervision (i.e., unsupervised per classical definition). We present principles based on which MILN automatically develops positional and scale invariant neurons in different layers. From sequentially sensed video streams, the proposed in-place learning algorithm develops a hierarchy of network representations. The global invariance was achieved through multi-layer quasi-invariances, with increasing invariance from early layers to the later layers. Experimental results are presented to show the effects of the principles.\nTitle:\nIn-Place Learning For Positional And Scale Invariance\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

These data are released after applying some anonymization techniques. Recently, researchers have paid significant attention to analyzing the risks of publishing privacy-sensitive data. Even if data anonymization techniques were applied to protect privacy-sensitive data, several de-anonymization attacks have been proposed to break their privacy. However, no theoretical quantification for relating the data vulnerability against de-anonymization attacks and the data utility that is preserved by the anonymization techniques exists. In this paper, we first address several fundamental open problems in the structure-based de-anonymization research by establishing a formal model for privacy breaches on anonymized data and quantifying the conditions for successful de-anonymization under a general graph model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on quantifying the relationship between anonymized utility and de-anonymization capability. Our quantification works under very general assumptions about the distribution from which the data are drawn, thus providing a theoretical guide for practical de-anonymization/anonymization techniques. Furthermore, we use multiple real-world datasets including a Facebook dataset, a Collaboration dataset, and two Twitter datasets to show the limitations of the state-of-the-art de-anonymization attacks. From these experimental results, we demonstrate the ineffectiveness of previous de-anonymization attacks and the potential of more powerful de-anonymization attacks in the future, by comparing the theoretical de-anonymization capability proposed by us with the practical experimental results of the state-of-the-art de-anonymization methods.\nTitle:\nHow to Quantify Graph De-anonymization Risks.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The design and implementation of HyperFlow offer security assurance because it is implemented using a security-typed hardware description language that enforces secure information flow. Unlike prior processors that aim to enforce simple information-flow policies such as noninterference, HyperFlow allows complex information flow policies that can be configured at run time. Its fine-grained, decentralized information flow mechanisms allow controlled communication among mutually distrusting processes and system calls into different security domains. We address the significant challenges in designing such a processor architecture with contributions in both the hardware architecture and the security type system. The paper discusses the architecture decisions that make the processor secure and describes ChiselFlow, a new secure hardware description language supporting lightweight information-flow enforcement. The HyperFlow architecture is prototyped on a full-featured processor that offers a complete RISC-V instruction set, and is shown to add moderate overhead to area and performance.\n\n\nTitle:\nHyperFlow: A Processor Architecture for Nonmalleable, Timing-Safe Information Flow Security.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The paper has two main contributions. First, we propose a flexible linear semi-supervised feature extraction method that seeks a non-linear subspace that is close to a linear one. The proposed method is based on a criterion that simultaneously exploits the discrimination information provided by the labeled samples, maintains the graph-based smoothness associated with all samples, regularizes the complexity of the linear transform, and minimizes the discrepancy between the unknown linear regression and the unknown non-linear projection. Second, we provide extensive experiments on four benchmark databases in order to study the performance of the proposed method. These experiments demonstrate much improvement over the state-of-the-art algorithms that are either based on label propagation or semi-supervised graph-based embedding.\nTitle:\nA Flexible Semi-Supervised Feature Extraction Method For Image Classification\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Top-k queries have been mainly studied from the perspective of the user, focusing primarily on efficient query processing. In this work, for the first time, we study top-k queries from the perspective of the product manufacturer. Given a potential product, which are the user preferences for which this product is in the top- k query result set? We identify a novel query type, namely reverse top-k query, that is essential for manufacturers to assess the potential market and impact of their products based on the competition. We formally define reverse top-k queries and introduce two versions of the query, namely monochromatic and bichromatic. We first provide a geometric interpretation of the monochromatic reverse top-k query in the solution space that helps to understand the reverse top-k query conceptually. Then, we study in more details the case of bichromatic reverse top- k query, which is more interesting for practical applications. Such a query, if computed in a straightforward manner, requires evaluating a top-k query for each user preference in the database, which is prohibitively expensive even for moderate datasets. In this paper, we present an efficient threshold-based algorithm that eliminates candidate user preferences, without processing the respective top-k queries. Furthermore, we introduce an indexing structure based on materialized reverse top-k views in order to speed up the computation of reverse top-k queries. Materialized reverse top-k views trade preprocessing cost for query speed up in a controllable manner. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of our techniques, which reduce the required number of top-k computations by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude. I. INTRODUCTION Recently, the support of rank-aware query processing, has attracted much attention in the database research community. Top-k queries (1)-(10) retrieve only the k objects that best match the user preferences, thus avoiding huge and over- whelming result sets. Therefore it is very important for a manufacturer that its products are returned in the highest ranked positions for as many different user preferences as possible. However, existing work studies only top-k queries from the perspective of customers that seek products matching their preferences. In this paper, we study top-k queries for business analysis, i.e., from the perspective of manufacturers who are interested in the impact of their products to customers, compared to their competitors\u0160 existing products. The ques- tion that arises is \"given a potential product, which are the user preferences for which this product is in the top-k query result set?\". To this end, we propose reverse top-k queries and study two different versions: monochromatic and bichromatic reverse top-k queries. In the former, there is no knowledge\nTitle:\nReverse top-k queries\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Indeed, it supports the user mental process for discovering important and unknown geospatial relations, trends and patterns. Spatial OLAP SOLAP integrates spatial data into OLAP and data warehouse systems. SOLAP models and tools are based on the concepts of spatial dimensions and measures that represent the axes and the subjects of the spatio-multidimensional analysis. Although powerful under some respect, current SOLAP models cannot support map generalization capabilities. This paper provides the first effort to integrate Map Generalization and OLAP. Firstly the authors define all modeling and querying requirements to do this integration, and then present a SOLAP model and algebra that support map generalization concepts. The approach extends SOLAP spatial hierarchies introducing multi-association relationships, supports imprecise measures, and it takes into account spatial dimensions constraints generated by multiple map generalization hierarchies.\nTitle:\nSpatial OLAP and Map Generalization: Model and Algebra\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we investigate relay selection schemes for security-constrained half-duplex cooperative wireless networks with multiple eavesdroppers, which have the ability to cooperate to overhear the source transmission. The proposed techniques select a trusted decode-and-forward relay to assist the source transmission and maximize the achievable secure rate for different eavesdropper policies cooperation or not; for the two cases, we assume that the channel is always available. In addition, a jamming method that selects two relay nodes to create an intentional interference at both phases of the decode-and-forward protocol to confound the eavesdropper nodes is also considered. Both the source-destination and source-eavesdroppers links are taken into account in the proposed analysis. Secrecy rate and secrecy outage probability are the two performance metrics that are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes while asymptotic approximations of the secrecy outage probability are also derived. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the performance improvement of the proposed schemes.

The MMGR Grand Challenge focused on the recognition of continuous natural gestures from multi-modal data (including RGB, Depth, user mask, Skeletal model, and audio). We made available a large labeled video database of 13,858 gestures from a lexicon of 20 Italian gesture categories recorded with a KinectTM camera. More than 54 teams participated in the challenge and a final error rate of 12% was achieved by the winner of the competition. Winners of the competition published their work in the workshop of the Challenge. The MMGR Workshop was held at ICMI conference 2013, Sidney. A total of 9 relevant papers with basis on multi-modal gesture recognition were accepted for presentation.

The ACM Multimedia 2012 Workshop on Crowdsourcing for Multimedia (CrowdMM 2012) provides a forum presenting crowdsourcing techniques for multimedia, as well as innovative ideas exemplifying how multimedia research can benefit from crowdsourcing. Through presented papers, invited talks and a panel, the workshop will promote interactive discussion on the scope and research potentials of crowdsourcing. The goal is to provide information to the multimedia research community on the principles of crowdsourcing and to inspire researchers to address the limitations of current studies by innovative use of human computation and collective intelligence. The workshop views crowdsourcing in the broad sense: it encompasses both unsolicited human contributions, e.g., tags assigned by users to images, and also solicited contributions, e.g., annotations gathered by making use of crowdsourcing platforms that micro-outsource tasks to a large pool of human workers.\nTitle:\nACM multimedia 2012 workshop on crowdsourcing for multimedia\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Firstly, the shape priors are aligned by using image moment to deprive the spatial related information. Secondly, the aligned shape priors are projected into the subspace expanded by using locality preserving projection to measure the similarity between the shapes. Finally, a new energy functional is built by combing data-driven and shape-driven energy items to implement a selective image segmentation method. We assess the proposed method and some representative LSMs on the synthetic, medical and natural images, the results suggest that the proposed one is superior to the pure data-driven LSMs and the representative LSMs with shape priors.\nTitle:\nA level set method with shape priors by using locality preserving projections\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

At the same time, the requirements of security mechanism for multimedia in IoT received a huge concern. Multimedia data is easily shared by devises, applications and social networks set by IoT. Therefore, it is indispensable to guarantee the privacy and security of shared multimedia data. In this paper, we address the secure multimedia data sharing problem in cloud computing by designing proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme. Our schemes cope with the issues of data validity, data confidentiality and authentication during encrypted multimedia data sharing. Unlike as usually done in the literature, we present a CCA-secure PRE scheme which removes pairings firstly. Then we design a refined CCA-secure PRE scheme called publicly verifiable PRE without parings. It is demonstrated that our schemes meet not only the security and high efficiency requirements of multimedia data sharing, but also the public verifiability. The validity of ciphertext, both the original and re-encrypted ciphertext, can be publicly verified which brings additional efficiency due to offloading the validity check of ciphertexts from the power-limited clients to any semi-honest public cloud.\nTitle:\nEfficient pairing-free PRE schemes for multimedia data sharing in IoT.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Distributed multimedia systems are complex and error prone. While there are well established testing techniques for the functionalities of such systems, the technique of stress testing to improve test efficiency has not received much attention. It has been argued th;it faults are more likely to occur in situations where there is a fierce competition for resources. When the system is heavily loaded, errors like mismanagement of buffers can be easily identified. In this paper, we present several criteria for selecting test cases, and describe two methods for generating test cases which maximize system resource usage. Our approach is based an symbolic execution and constraint solving. An example is given to illustrate the concepts and techniques.\nTitle:\nStress Testing of Distributed Multimedia Software Systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, isolation between the various components is limited. A faulty version of any one of the software components can compromise the whole system by consuming all available resources. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently identifying faulty software components running simultaneously in a single virtual machine. Current solutions that perform permanent and extensive monitoring to detect anomalies induce high overhead on the system, and can, by themselves, make the system unstable. In this paper we present an optimistic adaptive monitoring system to determine the faulty components of an application. Suspected components are finely analyzed by the monitoring system, but only when required. Unsuspected components are left untouched and execute normally. Thus, we perform localized just-in-time monitoring that decreases the accumulated overhead of the monitoring system. We evaluate our approach on two case studies against a state-of-the-art monitoring system and show that our technique correctly detects faulty components, while reducing overhead by an average of 93%.\nTitle:\nScapeGoat: Spotting abnormal resource usage in component-based reconfigurable software systems.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

As a result of the nonlinearity of RTD's, cellular neural networks (CNNs) designed with RTD's can achieve higher integration density and higher processing speed in comparison to standard CMOS based implementations. This paper describes two implements of RTD's based CNNs: one with RTD's only where RTD's are represented by current sources describing physics-based models, and the other with RTD's and FET's configured in well-known monostable-bistable logic elements (MOBILEs) circuitry. The paper also proposes a new and simple cell structure of MOBILE based CNN for connected component detection. Several image processing operations have been successfully simulated for these two types of CNNs. Simulation results show that RTD based CNNs have excellent performance in terms of complexity, speed and compactness.\nTitle:\nOn the implementation of RTD based CNNs\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It is shown that for all tested se- quences the proposed model predicts the total distortion due to a packet loss pattern within a 10 % error bound 80 % of the time, as compared to the conventional additive approach which achieves the same accuracy less then 40 % of the time.\nTitle:\nDISTORTION CHAINS FOR PREDICTING THE VIDEO DISTORTION FOR GENERAL PACKET LOSS PATTERNS\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Specifically, it categorises the cross-dataset recognition into 17 problems based on a set of carefully chosen data and label attributes. Such a problem-oriented taxonomy has allowed us to examine how different transfer-learning approaches tackle each problem and how well each problem has been researched to date. The comprehensive problem-oriented review of the advances in transfer learning with respect to the problem has not only revealed the challenges in transfer learning for visual recognition but also the problems (e.g., 8 of the 17 problems) that have been scarcely studied. This survey not only presents an up-to-date technical review for researchers but also a systematic approach and a reference for a machine-learning practitioner to categorise a real problem and to look up for a possible solution accordingly.\n\n\nTitle:\nRecent Advances in Transfer Learning for Cross-Dataset Visual Recognition: A Problem-Oriented Perspective.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Since the introduction of FODA in 1990, several variability modeling languages have been proposed in academia and industry, followed by hundreds of research papers on variability models and modeling. However, little is known about the practical use of such languages. We study the constructs, semantics, usage, and associated tools of two variability modeling languages, Kconfig and CDL, which are independently developed outside academia and used in large and significant software projects. We analyze 128 variability models found in 12 open--source projects using these languages. Our study 1) supports variability modeling research with empirical data on the real-world use of its flagship concepts. However, we 2) also provide requirements for concepts and mechanisms that are not commonly considered in academic techniques, and 3) challenge assumptions about size and complexity of variability models made in academic papers. These results are of interest to researchers working on variability modeling and analysis techniques and to designers of tools, such as feature dependency checkers and interactive product configurators.\nTitle:\nA Study of Variability Models and Languages in the Systems Software Domain\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This booming area is concerned with the design of cryptographic primitives resistant to arbitrary side-channel attacks, where an attacker can repeatedly and adaptively learn information about the secret key, subject only to the constraint that the overall amount of such information is bounded by some parameter l. We start by surveying recent results in the so called Relative Leakage Model, where all the parameters of the system are allowed to depend on l, and the goal is to make l large relative to the length of the secret key. We conclude by showing how to extend the relative leakage results to the Bounded Retrieval Model (aka \"Absolute Leakage Model\"), where only the secret key length is allowed to be slightly larger than l, but all other system parameters (e.g., publickey, communication, etc.) are independent of the absolute value of l. Throughout the presentation we will emphasize the information-theoretic techniques used in leakage-resilient cryptography.\nTitle:\nSurvey: leakage resilience and the bounded retrieval model\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Chordal rings are a variation of ring networks. By adding two extra links (or chords) at each vertex in a ring network, the reliability and fault-tolerance of the network are enhanced. Two spanning trees on a graph are said to be independent if they are rooted at the same vertex, say, r, and for each vertex v \\neq r, the two paths from r to v, one path in each tree, are internally disjoint. A set of spanning trees on a given graph is said to be independent if they are pairwise independent. Iwasaki et al. [CHECK END OF SENTENCE] proposed a linear time algorithm for finding four independent spanning trees on a chordal ring. In this paper, we give a new linear time algorithm to generate four independent spanning trees with a reduced height in each tree.

One of the unique features of qualitative networks, due to them lacking initial states, is that of \\\"reducing reachability sets\\\". Simply put, a state that is not visited after i steps will not be visited after i\u2032 steps for every i\u2032>i. We use this feature to create a compact representation of all the paths of a qualitative network of a certain structure. Combining this compact path representation with LTL model checking leads to significant acceleration in performance. In particular, for a recent model of Leukemia, our approach works at least 5 times faster than the standard approach and up to 100 times faster in some cases. Our approach enhances the iterative hypothesis-driven experimentation process used by biologists, enabling fast turn-around of executable biological models.\nTitle:\nModel-Checking signal transduction networks through decreasing reachability sets\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Then we extract LBP descriptors from each image and apply two types of kernels (chi(2) distance based and Hamming distance based) with the proposed KCD algorithm under the SRC framework for face recognition.

The problem of hyperspectral unmixing has proven to be a difficult task in unsupervised work settings where the endmembers and abundances are both unknown. In addition, this task becomes more challenging in the case that the spectral bands are degraded by noise. This paper presents a robust model for unsupervised hyperspectral unmixing. Specifically, our model is developed with the correntropy based metric where the non-negative constraints on both endmembers and abundances are imposed to keep physical significance. Besides, a sparsity prior is explicitly formulated to constrain the distribution of the abundances of each endmember. To solve our model, a half-quadratic optimization technique is developed to convert the original complex optimization problem into an iteratively re-weighted NMF with sparsity constraints. As a result, the optimization of our model can adaptively assign small weights to noisy bands and put more emphasis on noisefree bands. In addition, with sparsity constraints, our model can naturally generate sparse abundances. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in comparison to the related state-of-the-art unmixing models.\nTitle:\nRobust Hyperspectral Unmixing with Correntropy based Metric\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Important for the success of this method is the generation of strong valid inequalities, which tighten the linear programming relaxation of 0/1-IPs and thus allow for early pruning of parts of the search tree. In this paper we present a novel approach to generate valid inequalities for 0/1-IPs which is based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). BDDs are a datastructure which represents 0/1-vectors as paths of a certain acyclic graph. They have been successfully applied in computational logic, hardware verification and synthesis. We implemented our BDD cutting plane generator in a branch-and-cut framework and tested it on several instances of the MAX-ONES problem and randomly generated 0/1-IPs. Our computational results show that we have developed competitive code for these problems, on which state-of-the-art MIP-solvers fall short.\nTitle:\nBDDs in a branch and cut framework\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To achieve these tasks efficiently, they need quantitative information about design-time and run-time system aspects through usable and quick tools. While there is body of work focusing on code quality and metrics, their applicability at the design and architecture level and at scale are inconsistent and not proven. We are interested in exploring whether architecture can assist with better contextualizing existing system and code quality and metrics approaches. Furthermore, we ask whether we need additional architecture-level metrics to make progress and whether something as complex and subtle as software architecture can be quantified. The goal of this workshop is to discuss progress, gather empirical evidence, and identify priorities for a research agenda on architecture and metrics in the software engineering field.\n\n\nTitle:\nSecond international workshop on software architecture and metrics (SAM 2015)\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Networks with wireless links and mobile hosts violate many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded performance. We describe a simple protocol that improves TCP performance by modifying network-layer software only at a basestation without violating end-to-end TCP semantics. The main idea is to cache packets at the basestation and perform focal retransmissions. Simulations of this protocol show that is it significantly more robust in the presence of multiple packet losses in a single transmission window as compared to TCP. This enables our protocol to tolerate at least 10 times as high an error rate without any performance degradation\nTitle:\nEfficient TCP over networks with wireless links\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our algorithm requires a linear number of messages, whose maximal size depends on the induced width along the particular pseudotree chosen. We compare our algorithm with backtracking algorithms, and present experimental results. For some problem types we report orders of magnitude fewer messages, and the ability to deal with arbitrarily large problems.

Challenges arise because real-world applications usually have to deal with millions of records, with dozens of dimensions, and spatio-temporal context. Therefore, a tight integration of automated analysis and interactive visualizations is needed (as proposed in the context of Visual Analytics). Our approach uses the well-studied capabilities provided by Data Warehouses supporting knowledge discovery and decision-making to analyse spatio-temporal behaviour of pattern in high-dimensional spaces.

This surface is then polygonalized and texture-mapped, yielding in a 3D model easily rendered with standard graphics hardware.\nTitle:\nA Surface Evolution Approach o Probabilistic Space Carving\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, if a USB device is lost, stolen, or hacked, it may lead to leakage of critical information. It is a logical outcome that malicious individuals will try to steal their colleagues' USB memories. Consequently, various USB products with built-in security functions have been developed. To our knowledge, there has been little or no security analysis and comparison of these devices. This paper explores technological and architectural approaches to secure USB memories while analyzing their vulnerabilities, especially for resistance to reverse engineering attacks on the authentication protocols and data decryption. In this analysis, we classify vulnerabilities of these devices into 12 categories to summarize the current security situations on USB memories. Additionally, we derive a more secure authentication protocol based on our analysis. It is expected for secure USB products, including USB memory devices, to be revised with enhanced authentication protocols as a result of this effort.

The paper demonstrates how features and properties of commitments can be described in this action language. We show how Lmt can handle both simple commitment actions as well as complex commitment protocols. Furthermore, the semantics of Lmt provides a uniform solution to different problems in reasoning about commitments such as the problem of (i) verifying whether an agent fails (or succeeds) to deliver on its commitments; (ii) identifying pending commitments; and (iii) suggesting ways to satisfy pending commitments.\nTitle:\nFormalizing commitments using action languages\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

When the clean training set is available, we show that a model-based noise compensation method can be effective to improve system robustness to noise. Given the testing sets, as a whole, the feature-based methods can yield about 22% relative improvement in accuracy for multi-condition training task, and the model-based method can have about 63% relative performance improvement when systems were trained on clean training set.\nTitle:\nFeature extraction and model-based noise compensation for noisy speech recognition evaluated on AURORA 2 task\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

DFIA combines principles of side channel analysis and fault attacks to try and extract the key using faulty ciphertexts only. Biased fault attacks have also been shown to weaken traditional redundancy based countermeasures, such as Concurrent Error Detection (CED) techniques, that provide security against classical fault attacks such as Differential Fault Analysis (DFA). While these countermeasures are effective under the assumption that the adversary uses a uniform fault model, they are vulnerable to attacks using biased fault models. Till date, no effective countermeasure against such biased fault attacks has been reported in literature. In this work, we propose a countermeasure strategy that combines the principles of redundancy with that of fault space transformation to achieve security against both classical and biased fault attacks. The novelty in the proposed countermeasure lies in the concept of transforming the fault space, that reduces the probability that the adversary can bypass the redundant checks by introducing the same fault in the original and redundant computations. All claims have been validated via practical experiments on a SASEBO GII board.\nTitle:\nUsing State Space Encoding To Counter Biased Fault Attacks on AES Countermeasures.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

While there is no clear consensus on how roles should be represented, a survey of the literature suggests that we should address both responsibilities and rights in the modeling of roles [1].

We leverage existing work on the formalization of business contracts [2] and the formulation of goals in the i* modeling framework [3].

The problem has been formalized under the unified approach based on parameterized ranking functions (PRFs) and the possible world semantics. Given a PRF, one can always compute the ranking function values of all the tuples to determine the top-k tuples, which is a formidable task for large databases. In this paper, we present a general approach to pruning for the framework based on PRFs. We show a mathematical manipulation of possible worlds which reveals key insights in the part of computation that may be pruned and how to achieve it in a systematic fashion. This leads to concrete pruning methods for a wide range of ranking functions.

However, wireless links are typically prone to bursts of errors, with characteristics which vary over time.We propose a wireless system suitable for real-time remote patient monitoring in which the necessary reliability and guaranteed latency are both achieved by an efficient error control scheme. We have paired an example remote electrocardiography application to this wireless system. We also developed a tool chain that uses a formal description of the proposed wireless medical system architecture in the architecture analysis and design language to assess various combinations of system parameters: we can determine the QoS in terms of packet-delivery ratio and the service latency, and also the size of jitter buffer required for seamless ECG monitoring. A realistic assessment, based on data from the MIT-BIT arrhythmia database, shows that the proposed wireless system can achieve an appropriate level of QoS for real-time ECG monitoring if link-level error control is correctly implemented. Additionally, we present guidelines for the design of energy-efficient link-level error control, derived from energy data, obtained from simulations.\nTitle:\nDesign and QoS of a wireless system for real-time remote electrocardiography.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Most international financial institutions have been implementing anti-money laundering solutions to fight investment fraud. However, traditional investigative techniques consume numerous man-hours. Recently, data mining approaches have been developed and are considered as well-suited techniques for detecting money laundering activities.

By allowing a file system to specify a set of possible address targets, range writes enable the disk to choose the final on-disk location of the request; the disk improves performance by writing to the closest location and subsequently reporting its choice to the file system above. The result is a clean separation of responsibility; the file system (as high-level manager) provides coarse-grained control over placement, while the disk (as low-level worker) makes the final fine-grained placement decision to improve write performance. We show the benefits of range writes through numerous simulations and a prototype implementation, in some cases improving performance by a factor of three across both synthetic and real workloads.\nTitle:\nAvoiding file system micromanagement with range writes\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

LogP characterizes the performance of modern parallel machines with a small set of parameters: the communication latency (L), overhead (o), bandwidth (g), and the number of processors (P). We develop implementations of these algorithms in Split-C, a parallel extension to C, and compare the performance predicted by LogP to actual performance on a CM-5 of 32 to 512 processors for a range of problem sizes. We evaluate the robustness of the algorithms by varying the distribution and ordering of the key values. We also briefly examine the sensitivity of the algorithms to the communication parameters. We show that the LogP model is a valuable guide in the development of parallel algorithms and a good predictor of implementation performance. The model encourages the use of data layouts which minimize communication and balanced communication schedules which avoid contention. With an empirical model of local processor performance, LogP predictions closely match observed execution times on uniformly distributed keys across a broad range of problem and machine sizes. We find that communication performance is oblivious to the distribution of the key values, whereas the local processor performance is not; some communication phases are sensitive to the ordering of keys due to contention. Finally, our analysis shows that overhead is the most critical communication parameter in the sorting algorithms\nTitle:\nFast parallel sorting under LogP: experience with the CM-5\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The use of objective measurement is quite uncommon in TAM. In addition to its low frequency, another striking phenomenon is the way objective measurement is used. Namely, only a minor potential of the information available is typically used, and, for example, the temporal aspect (changes in time) is almost always neglected. The paper describes the TAM studies where objective measurement of usage has been utilized and ponders the way objective measurements are taken. The ultimate goal of the paper is to improve objective measures used in TAM studies. To this end, several suggestions are given.\nTitle:\nA review on objective measurement of usage in technology acceptance studies\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The research of my PhD thesis focuses on image emotion computing (IEC), which aims to predict the emotion perceptions of given images. The development of IEC is greatly constrained by two main challenges: affective gap and subjective evaluation. Previous works mainly focused on finding features that can express emotions better to bridge the affective gap, such as elements-of-art based features and shape features. According to the emotion representation models, including categorical emotion states (CES) and dimensional emotion space (DES), three different tasks are traditionally performed on IEC:  affective image classification, regression and retrieval. The state-of-the-art methods on the three above tasks are image-centric, focusing on the dominant emotions for the majority of viewers. For my PhD thesis, I plan to answer the following questions: (1) Compared to the low-level elements-of-art based features, can we find some higher level features that are more interpretable and have stronger link to emotions? (2) Are the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image subjective and different? If they are, how can we tackle the user-centric emotion prediction? (3) For image-centric emotion computing, can we predict the emotion distribution instead of the dominant emotion category?\nTitle:\nAffective Computing and Applications of Image Emotion Perceptions.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Existing proposals in the crawling area are aware of the efficiency problem, but still most of them need to download pages in order to classify them as relevant or not. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for designing crawlers supported by a web page classifier that relies solely on URLs to determine page relevance. Such a crawler is able to choose in each step only the URLs that lead to relevant pages, and therefore reduces the number of unnecessary pages downloaded, optimising bandwidth and making it efficient and suitable for virtual integration systems. Our preliminary experiments show that such a classifier is able to distinguish between links leading to different kinds of pages, without previous intervention from the user.\nTitle:\nA conceptual framework for efficient web crawling in virtual integration contexts\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Feature selection algorithms are largely studied separately according to the type of learning: supervised or unsupervised. This work exploits intrinsic properties underlying supervised and unsupervised feature selection algorithms, and proposes a unified framework for feature selection based on spectral graph theory. The proposed framework is able to generate families of algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection. And we show that existing powerful algorithms such as ReliefF (supervised) and Laplacian Score (unsupervised) are special cases of the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to unify supervised and unsupervised feature selection, and enable their joint study under a general framework.

Water absorbs light at almost all wavelengths whose absorption coefficient is related to the wavelength. Based on the Beer-Lambert model, we introduce a bispectral depth recovery method that leverages the light absorption difference between two near-infrared wavelengths captured with a distant point source and orthographic cameras. Through extensive analysis, we show that accurate depth can be recovered irrespective of the surface texture and reflectance, and introduce algorithms to correct for nonidealities of a practical implementation, including tilted light source and camera placement and non-ideal bandpass filters. We construct a coaxial bispectral depth imaging system using low-cost off-the-shelf hardware and demonstrate its use for recovering the shapes of complex and dynamic objects in water. Experimental results validate the theory and practical implementation of this novel depth recovery paradigm, which we refer to as shape from water.\nTitle:\nShape From Water: Bispectral Light Absorption For Depth Recovery\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, both methods still have several drawbacks when we attempt to apply them to mixed reality where we integrate virtual images with real background images. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a new method, which we refer to as the Eigen-Texture method. The proposed method samples appearances of a real object under various illumination and viewing conditions, and compresses them in the 2D coordinate system defined on the 3D model surface generated from a sequence of range images. The Eigen-Texture method is an example of a view-dependent texturing approach which combines the advantages of image-based and model-based approaches: No reflectance analysis of the object surface is needed, while an accurate 3D geometric model facilitates integration with other scenes. This paper describes the method and reports on its implementation.\nTitle:\nEigen-Texture Method: Appearance Compression and Synthesis Based on a 3D Model\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Automation of the entire process of expression analysis can potentially facilitate human-computer interaction, making it to resemble mechanisms of human-human communication. In this paper, we present an ongoing research that aims at development of a novel spatiotemporal approach to expression classification in video. The novelty comes from a new facial representation that is based on local spatiotemporal feature descriptors. In particular, a combined dynamic edge and texture information is used for reliable description of both appearance and motion of the expression. Support vector machines are utilized to perform a final expression classification.

Due to the complex application contexts and various user requirements, more and more applications are now making use of different middleware platforms. It might require the cooperation of several types of middleware, and result in challenging issues for collaborative management of heterogeneous middleware. To solve this problem, it may be a feasible solution to make management interfaces delivered in the form of services and used in service-oriented styles. In this paper, we propose an approach to encapsulating middleware management interfaces into Web services. First of all, we introduce middleware management problems induced by the development of requirements. Then, we present the technical challenges and illustrate the details about how to enable different management interfaces to be in service-oriented styles. Followed by identified technical challenges, we evaluate the approach and primarily discuss how to manage middleware systems collaboratively based on management services.\nTitle:\nService Encapsulation for Middleware Management Interfaces\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The most important application of the algorithms seems to be in achieving graph drawing by axis separation, where each axis of the drawing addresses different aspects of aesthetics.\nTitle:\nOne-dimensional layout optimization, with applications to graph drawing by axis separation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We compare different properties of these models and the corresponding techniques to handle their common problems such as gradient vanishing and generation diversity.

One performance goal, rate of fault detection, measures how quickly faults are detected within the testing process. In previous work we provided a metric, APFD, for measuring rate of fault detection, and techniques for prioritizing test cases to improve APFD, and reported the results of experiments using those techniques. This metric and these techniques, however, applied only in cases in which test costs and fault severity are uniform. In this paper, we present a new metric for assessing the rate of fault detection of prioritized test cases, that incorporates varying test case and fault costs. We present the results of a case study illustrating the application of the metric. This study raises several practical questions that might arise in applying test case prioritization; we discuss how practitioners could go about answering these questions.\nTitle:\nIncorporating varying test costs and fault severities into test case prioritization\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Optical networking with advantages of high capacity and cost efficiency, would improve the network throughput for the cloud platform and improve the performance for serving big data applications. How to realize the network-aware resource provisioning for the big data applications in the optical DCN architecture would be an important issue that needs to be investigated. In this work, we focus on the network-aware resource provisioning in data center with different optical DCN architectures. Our target is to make use of limited computing and network resources in the data center to serve the maximum number of applications with minimal total cost. Optical networking is used to provide the guaranteed network bandwidth required by the applications. Mixed integer linear/quadratic programming (MILP/MIQP) optimization models are developed to solve the network-aware resource provisioning problem in the optical data center based on different types of DCN architectures.\nTitle:\nNetwork-aware virtual data center resource orchestration in an optical data center\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In a traditional operating system, the kernel mediates access to device hardware by server applications to enforce process isolation as well as network and disk security. We have designed and implemented a new operating system, Arrakis, that splits the traditional role of the kernel in two. Applications have direct access to virtualized I/O devices, allowing most I/O operations to skip the kernel entirely, while the kernel is re-engineered to provide network and disk protection without kernel mediation of every operation. We describe the hardware and software changes needed to take advantage of this new abstraction, and we illustrate its power by showing improvements of 2 to 5 \u00d7 in latency and 9 \u00d7 throughput for a popular persistent NoSQL store relative to a well-tuned Linux implementation.\nTitle:\nArrakis: the operating system is the control plane\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

While this model has been used extensively in distributed computing and in secure multiparty computation, lower bounds on communication complexity in this model and related models have been somewhat scarce. In recent work, strong lower bounds of the form \u03a9(n \u00b7 k) were obtained for several functions in the message-passing model; however, a lower bound on the classical set disjoint ness problem remained elusive. In this paper, we prove a tight lower bound of \u03a9(n \u00b7 k) for the set disjoint ness problem in the message passing model.

We begin with formulating the denoising problem as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate problem. Then, according to the Bayes rule, we show that the MAP estimate is determined by two terms: noise conditional density model and priori conditional density model. Based on the assumptions that the noise satisfies Gaussian distribution and the priori model is measured by the bit-rate, the MAP estimate can be expressed as a rate distortion optimization problem. With this, we are able to simultaneously perform MAP-based video denoising and rate-distortion optimized video encoding under some assumptions. Moreover, we describe in details how to select suitable coding parameters, i.e., quantization parameter, mode, motion vector, reference index, and regularization parameter.

The technique combines a robust, automated technique for ventricular segmentation with a 3D surface-based radial thickness mapping approach that allows spatially-localized statistical tests of relative shape differences between clinical groups. The technique is used to analyze localized ventricular expansion in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a large cohort of community-dwelling elderly individuals (N = 339). The resulting maps are the first to chart localized ventricular dilation in a cohort of this size. Besides showing patterns of ventricular expansion that may be consistent with the spatial progression of AD-related pathology, the maps reveal new information about localized ventricular atrophy that may have been overlooked to date. A detailed understanding of spatial atrophy patterns may be useful for early disease detection or for patient monitoring in drug trials.\nTitle:\nMapping Ventricular Changes Related To Dementia And Mild Cognitive Impairment In A Large Community-Based Cohort\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Most current systems require sensors which intrusively touch the user's skin. Recent advances in contact-free physiological signals open the door to many new types of applications. This technology promises to measure heart rate (HR) and respiration using video only. The effectiveness of this technology, its limitations, and ways of overcoming them deserves particular attention. In this paper, we evaluate this technique for measuring HR in a controlled situation, in a naturalistic computer interaction session, and in an exercise situation. For comparison, HR was measured simultaneously using an electrocardiography device during all sessions. The results replicated the published results in controlled situations, but show that they cannot yet be considered as a valid measure of HR in naturalistic human-computer interaction. We propose a machine learning approach to improve the accuracy of HR detection in naturalistic measurements. The results demonstrate that the root mean squared error is reduced from 43.76 to 3.64 beats/min using the proposed method.\nTitle:\nA Machine Learning Approach to Improve Contactless Heart Rate Monitoring Using a Webcam\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Identification of such functional relations is crucial for annotation of unknown genes as well as the exploration of the underlying regulatory program. Gene expression profiling experiments provide noisy datasets about how cells respond to different experimental conditions. One way of analyzing these datasets is the identification of gene groups with similar expression patterns. A prevailing technique to find gene pairs with correlated expression profiles is to use linear measures like Pearson's correlation coefficient or Euclidean distance. Similar genes are later compiled into a co-expression network to explore the system-level functionality of genes. However, the noise inherent in microarray datasets reduces the sensitivity of these measures and produces many spurious pairs with no real biological relevance. In this paper, we explore an extrinsic way of calculating similarity of two genes based on their relations with other genes. We show that `similar' pairs identified by extrinsic measures overlap better with known biological annotations available in the Gene Ontology database. Our results also indicate that extrinsic measures are useful in enhancing the quality of co-expression networks and their functional subnetworks.\nTitle:\nMutual Information Based Extrinsic Similarity for Microarray Analysis\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this regard, we analyze the discriminative power of keystroke sound in the context of a continuous user authentication application. Motivated by the concept of digraphs used in modeling keystroke dynamics, a virtual alphabet is first learned from keystroke sound segments. Next, the digraph latency within the pairs of virtual letters, along with other statistical features, is used to generate match scores. The resultant scores are indicative of the similarities between two sound streams, and are fused to make a final authentication decision. Experiments on both static text-based and free text-based authentications on a database of 50 subjects demonstrate the potential as well as the limitations of keystroke sound.\nTitle:\nInvestigating the Discriminative Power of Keystroke Sound\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Rather than tracking individual users for the duration of an activity, Group Touch distinguishes users from each other by modeling whether an interaction with the tabletop corresponds to either: (1) a new user, or (2) a change in users currently interacting with the tabletop. This reframing of the challenge as distinguishing users rather than tracking and identifying them allows Group Touch to support multi-user collaboration in real-world settings without custom instrumentation. Specifically, Group Touch examines pairs of touches and uses the difference in orientation, distance, and time between two touches to determine whether the same person performed both touches in the pair. Validated with field data from high-school students in a classroom setting, Group Touch distinguishes among users \\\"in the wild\\\" with a mean accuracy of 92.92% (SD=3.94%). Group Touch can imbue collaborative touch applications in real-world settings with the ability to distinguish among multiple users.\nTitle:\nGroup Touch: Distinguishing Tabletop Users in Group Settings via Statistical Modeling of Touch Pairs.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Unfortunately, comparing results across multiple studies is difficult. A key contributor to that difficulty is network geometry - the spatial arrangement of hosts and links. In this paper, we study the relationship between network geometry and geolocation accuracy. We define the notion of scaling dimension to characterize the geometry of a wide array of different networks. We show that the scaling dimension correlates with a number of aspects of geolocation accuracy. In networks with low scaling dimension, geolocation accuracy improves more rapidly with the addition of landmarks. Further, we show that the scaling dimension of operator networks varies considerably across different regions of the world. Our results point to the complexity of, and suggest standards for, the meaningful evaluation of geolocation algorithms.\nTitle:\nUnderstanding geolocation accuracy using network geometry\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our system is the first hardware accelerated complete implementation of deep shadow maps, which unifies the computation of volumetric and geometric shadows. Up to now such unified computation was limited to software-only rendering. Previous hardware accelerated techniques can handle only geometric or only volumetric scenes - both resulting in the loss of important properties of the original concept. Our approach supports interactive rendering of polyhedrally bounded volumetric objects on the GPU based on ray casting. The ray casting can be conveniently used for both the shadow map computation and the rendering. We show how anti-aliased high-quality shadows are feasible in scenes composed of multiple overlapping translucent objects, and how sparse scenes can be handled efficiently using clustered deep shadow maps.\nTitle:\nClustered Deep Shadow Maps for Integrated Polyhedral and Volume Rendering.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Memory streaming provides a promising solution to the coherence miss bottleneck because it improves memory level parallelism and lookahead while using on-chip resources efficiently. We observe that the order in which shared data are consumed by one processor is correlated to the order in which they were produced by another. We investigate this phenomenon and demonstrate that it can be exploited to send Store-ORDered Streams (SORDS) of shared data from producers to consumers, thereby eliminating coherent read misses. Using a trace-driven analysis of all user and OS memory references in a cache-coherent distributed shared-memory multiprocessor, we show that SORDS based memory streaming can eliminate between 36% and 100% of all coherent read misses in scientific workloads and between 23% and 48%in online transaction processing workloads.\nTitle:\nStore-Ordered Streaming of Shared Memory\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Unfortunately, while replicas should be distributed geographically for maximum fault tolerance, current replicated state machine protocols tend to magnify the effects of high network latencies caused by geographic distribution. In this paper, we examine how to use speculative execution at the clients of a replicated service to reduce the impact of network and protocol latency. We first give design principles for using client speculation with replicated services, such as generating early replies and prioritizing throughput over latency. We then describe a mechanism that allows speculative clients to make new requests through replica-resolved speculation and predicated writes. We implement a detailed case study that applies this approach to a standard Byzantine fault tolerant protocol (PBFT) for replicated NFS and counter services. Client speculation trades in 18% maximum throughput to decrease the effective latency under light workloads, letting us speed up run time on single-client micro-benchmarks 1.08-19\u00d7 when the client is co-located with the primary. On a macro-benchmark, reduced latency gives the client a speedup of up to 5\u00d7.\nTitle:\nTolerating latency in replicated state machines through client speculation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

If someone could copy their entire database, it would be a competitive catastrophe. Yet, a data provider is in the business of providing data, so access to the database cannot be restricted entirely. How is the data provider to permit legitimate access to users who request access to small portions of the database while protecting the database from wholesale copying? We suggest that delay can be used for this purpose. We show, under reasonable assumptions, that it is possible to slow down the copying of the entire dataset by an arbitrary amount ensuring that queries that return a significant portion of the database introduce a delay that is orders of magnitude higher than that for legitimate user queries. We then consider issues of change, and show, under reasonable assumptions of rates of change, how to limit access so that the voyeur is guaranteed never to have a complete up-to-date dataset. We also present several extensions of these two major results. We have implemented our technique on a commercial relational database, and we present numbers showing that the analytically expected delays are indeed observed experimentally, and also that the overheads of implementing our scheme are small.\nTitle:\nUsing Delay to Defend Against Database Extraction\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

By building upon recent foundational investigations, we introduce a labelled transition semantics and a novel notion of bisimilarity that is fully abstract w.r.t. the typical observational equivalence in ccp.\nTitle:\nDeriving labels and bisimilarity for concurrent constraint programming\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this context, we take advantage of two significant technology trends: the commoditization of WiFi WLAN technology and the rapid growth of cellular data services. We propose an architecture called Cool-Tether that harnesses the cellular radio links of one or more mobile smartphones in the vicinity, builds a WiFi hotspot on-the-fly, and provides energy-efficient, affordable connectivity. Prior approaches to supporting such a tethered mode operation have relied on the WiFi ad hoc mode, which impedes the key goal of conserving battery energy on mobile phones. To address the challenges of energy efficiency, Cool-Tether carefully optimizes the energy drain of the WAN (GPRS/ EDGE/ 3G) and WiFi radios on smartphones. In particular, Cool-Tether employs a cloud-based gatherer and an energy-aware striper that exploit the unique energy characteristics of the WAN radio. Cool-Tether also uses a novel reverse-infrastructure mode for WiFi, where the client host serves as a WiFi access point while the mobile phone gateway serves as a WiFi client. We prototype Cool-Tether on smartphones and, experimentally demonstrate savings in energy consumption between 38% - 71% compared to prior energy-agnostic solutions.\nTitle:\nCool-Tether: energy efficient on-the-fly wifi hot-spots using mobile phones\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Two visa protocols are presented and evaluated: one that requires distributed state information in gateways and one that uses additional encryptions instead of distributed state. Applications for such visa protocols include access control, accounting and billing for packet transit, and network resource management.<>\nTitle:\nVisa protocols for controlling interorganizational datagram flow\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Although ray tracing can correctly simulate light refraction, doing it in real time still remains a challenge. This work presents an image-space technique to simulate the refraction of distant environments in real time. Contrary to previous approaches for interactive refraction at multiple interfaces, the proposed technique does not require any preprocessing. As a result, it can be directly applied to objects undergoing shape deformations, which is a common and important feature for character animation in computer games and movies. Our approach is general in the sense that it can be used with any object representation that can be rasterized on a programmable GPU. It is based on an efficient ray-intersection procedure performed against a dynamic depth map and carried out in 2D texture space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by simulating refractions through animated characters composed of several hundred thousand polygons in real time.\nTitle:\nReal-time refraction through deformable objects\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Voting is a general method for preference aggregation, but seminal results have shown that all general voting protocols are manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using voting protocols where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard computationally. The complexity of manipulating realistic elections where the number of candidates is a small constant was recently studied [4], but the emphasis was on the question of whether or not a protocol becomes hard to manipulate for some constant number of candidates. That work, in many cases, left open the question: How many candidates are needed to make elections hard to manipulate? This is a crucial question when comparing the relative manipulability of different voting protocols. In this paper we answer that question for the voting protocols of the earlier study: plurality, Borda, STV, Copeland, maximin, regular cup, and randomized cup. We also answer that question for two voting protocols for which no results on the complexity of manipulation have been derived before: veto and plurality with runoff. It turns out that the voting protocols under study become hard to manipulate at 3 candidates, 4 candidates, 7 candidates, or never.\nTitle:\nHow many candidates are needed to make elections hard to manipulate?\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Today, ISPs advertise their available service plans using only generic upload and download speeds. Unfortunately, these metrics do not always accurately reflect the varying performance that home users will experience for a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose that each ISP service plan carry a \"nutrition label\" that conveys more comprehensive information about network metrics along many dimensions, including various aspects of throughput, latency, loss rate, and jitter. We first justify why these metrics should form the basis of a network nutrition label. Then, we demonstrate that current plans that are superficially similar with respect to advertised download rates may have different performance according to the label metrics. We close with a discussion of the challenges involved in presenting a nutrition label to users in a way that is both accurate and easy to understand.\nTitle:\nHelping users shop for ISPs with internet nutrition labels\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We assume that the p frames have almost no overlap on the coverage between frames and a request is satisfied only if it is fully covered. We then propose a Resolution Ratio with Non-Partial Coverage (RRNPC) metric to quantify the satisfaction level for a given request with respect to a set of p candidate frames. We propose a lattice-based approximation algorithm to search for the solution that maximizes the overall satisfaction. The algorithm builds on an induction-like approach that finds the relationship between the solution to the (p - 1)-frame problem and the solution to the p-frame problem. For a given approximation bound isin, the algorithm runs in O(n/isin3 +p2/isin6) time.

In this paper, we consider the immobilization of freely moving serial chains of $n$ hinged polygons using frictionless point fingers. We first set this problem in the context of classical grasping theory by showing that chain immobilization can only be achieved with equilibrium grasps. Then, we describe two immobilization approaches based on first- and second-order geometric effects. Based on curvature effects, chains of $n \\ne 3$ hinged polygons with nonparallel edges can be immobilized by $n + 2$ frictionless point fingers. Serial chains of three hinged polygons form an exception to this rule. Based on first-order geometric effects, we describe how to immobilize any chain of $n$ hinged polygons with only one extra contact for the entire chain, using a total of $n + 3$ frictionless point fingers. Moreover, the immobilizing grasps are robust with respect to small contact placement errors. The results are illustrated with examples and described as readily implementable procedures.\nTitle:\nImmobilizing 2-D Serial Chains in Form-Closure Grasps\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we propose a new, highly automated approach for protecting existing Web applications against SQL injection. Our approach has both conceptual and practical advantages over most existing techniques. From the conceptual standpoint, the approach is based on the novel idea of positive tainting and the concept of syntax-aware evaluation. From the practical standpoint, our technique is at the same time precise and efficient and has minimal deployment requirements. The paper also describes wasp, a tool that implements our technique, and a set of studies performed to evaluate our approach. In the studies, we used our tool to protect several Web applications and then subjected them to a large and varied set of attacks and legitimate accesses.

The most computationally expensive step in this approach comes from the calculation of optical flow which prevents it to be real-time. This paper accelerates this architecture by replacing optical flow with motion vector which can be obtained directly from compressed videos without extra calculation. However, motion vector lacks fine structures, and contains noisy and inaccurate motion patterns, leading to the evident degradation of recognition performance. Our key insight for relieving this problem is that optical flow and motion vector are inherent correlated. Transferring the knowledge learned with optical flow CNN to motion vector CNN can significantly boost the performance of the latter. Specifically, we introduce three strategies for this, initialization transfer, supervision transfer and their combination. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable recognition performance to the state-of-the-art, while our method can process 390.7 frames per second, which is 27 times faster than the original two-stream method.\nTitle:\nReal-Time Action Recognition With Enhanced Motion Vector Cnns\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, we often prefer to choose the latter due to the considerations of error propagation and computational complexity, especially in real-time applications such as video compression and transcoding [1]. How to get a compromised solution between performance and complexity is a challenging problem, which will be addressed in this paper. We first propose a directional adaptive algorithm for motion detection, and then introduce a reasonable and applicable adaptive MC/NMC deinterlacing mechanism to meet the requirements of real-time applications. The proposed adaptive deinterlacing scheme is proved efficient by both subjective visual sensation and objective experimental results. Feasibility of real-time applications is given as well as the coding efficiency tested by the Audio Video coding Standard (AVS) of China.

The conventional local binary pattern can be regarded as a special local quantization method with two levels, 0 and 1. Some variants of the LBP demonstrate that increasing the local quantization level can enhance the local discriminative capability. Hence, we present a simple and unified framework to validate the performance of different local quantization levels. In the proposed LQC, pixels located in different quantization levels are separately counted and the average local gray value difference is adopted to set a series of quantization thresholds. Extensive experiments are carried out on several challenging texture databases. The experimental results demonstrate the LQC with appropriate local quantization level can effectively characterize the local gray-level distribution. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.\nTitle:\nLocal Quantization Code histogram for texture classification\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In parallel, several research efforts have demonstrated that there is a long tail of attributes, often thousands per class of entities, that are of interest to users. Researchers are beginning to leverage these new collections of attributes to expand the ontologies that power search engines and to recognize entity--attribute queries. Because of the sheer number of potential attributes, such tasks require us to impose some structure on this long and heavy tail of attributes. This paper introduces the problem of organizing the attributes by expressing the compositional structure of their names as a rule-based grammar. These rules offer a compact and rich semantic interpretation of multi-word attributes, while generalizing from the observed attributes to new unseen ones. The paper describes an unsupervised learning method to generate such a grammar automatically from a large set of attribute names. Experiments show that our method can discover a precise grammar over 100,000 attributes of {\\sc Countries} while providing a 40-fold compaction over the attribute names. Furthermore, our grammar enables us to increase the precision of attributes from 47\\% to more than 90\\% with only a minimal curation effort. Thus, our approach provides an efficient and scalable way to expand ontologies with attributes of user interest.\n\n\nTitle:\nDiscovering Structure in the Universe of Attribute Names.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper we investigate this question and introduce a framework for user modeling on Twitter which enriches the semantics of Twitter messages (tweets) and identifies topics and entities (e.g. persons, events, products) mentioned in tweets. We analyze how strategies for constructing hashtag-based, entity-based or topic-based user profiles benefit from semantic enrichment and explore the temporal dynamics of those profiles. We further measure and compare the performance of the user modeling strategies in context of a personalized news recommendation system. Our results reveal how semantic enrichment enhances the variety and quality of the generated user profiles. Further, we see how the different user modeling strategies impact personalization and discover that the consideration of temporal profile patterns can improve recommendation quality.\nTitle:\nAnalyzing user modeling on twitter for personalized news recommendations\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Indeed the development and use of adequate measurement of software and its design process are essential to the production of cost-effective and quality software. Actually, software metrics are not only significant as analysis instruments, but regarding the present iterative software design paradigms, they are likewise becoming powerful synthesis mechanisms. The main objective of this paper is to show that modern software tools and especially compiler-compilers, metric life cycle model and fractal metrics can improve the situation and make the development and use of software metrics more efficient and effective.\nTitle:\nPROMIS: a software metrics tool generator\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To facilitate selection, personalisation and navigation of learning paths we propose to describe learning paths in a formal and uniform way by means of a learning path specification. This paper explains the rationale behind the Learning Path Specification. Based on a framework developed for the evaluation of the specification the paper describes a study that was carried out to establish pragmatic quality, i.e. whether stakeholders can understand and use the specification. The paper explores the relationship between the concepts pragmatic quality, usability, and desirability, and distinguishes first-order and second-order pragmatic quality, relating it to different stakeholders: software developers and end-users. First-order pragmatic quality of the Learning Path Specification was evaluated during the process of developing a tool that describes learning paths according to the specification: the Learning Path Editor. Second-order pragmatic quality was evaluated through workshop sessions with end-users involving some hands-on experiences with this tool. The paper describes adaptations made to the specification in the process of developing the Editor. End-user evaluations were quite positive, leading to one more adaptation.\nTitle:\nAssessing the Learning Path Specification: a Pragmatic Quality Approach\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

High quality audio-visual content is distributed over heterogeneous IP-based content networks, on both set-top box and web-based platforms. Peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies are exploited to provide energy efficient and low-cost delivery for commercial and user-generated content. The infrastructure and functional components are first presented exploring a number of key designs that facilitate the entire eco-system of content ingest, transcoding, P2P tracking, distribution, statistics, end systems, as well as integration of social networking. Due to the dynamic nature of P2P distribution, a quality measurement service with respect to user experience is also essential for the service evaluation and diagnosis. A multimodal QoE measurement framework which evaluates the IPTV services by collaborating measurements with a variety of different aspects is presented. Results of a use case are also described to verify the effectiveness of the measurement framework in exploiting relevant metrics from service components.\nTitle:\nP2P-Based IPTV Services: Design, Deployment, and QoE Measurement.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

HCI4D has matured through a series of previous HCI related conferences and workshops and a growing body of work have established it as subfield of its own [1][2][4][5][6]. We believe it is now time to focus on more specific topics within this subfield and this workshop is dedicated to one such topic; namely how the next wave of more sophisticated mobile handsets will enable new interaction forms and interfaces, and how this can be use to create more natural ways of interacting with mobile ICTs. The aim of this workshop is to discuss the current (and near-future) technologies and create a research agenda for how we can design, implement and evaluate new and more natural interaction forms and interfaces for mobile devices. The ultimate goal is to lower the technical and literacy barriers and get relevant information, applications and services out to the next billion users.\nTitle:\nNUIs for new worlds: new interaction forms and interfaces for mobile applications in developing countries\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In 2014, global users of Yahoo! Search saved more than 50% keystrokes when submitting English queries by selecting suggestions of QAC. Users' preference of queries can be inferred during user-QAC interactions, such as dwelling on suggestion lists for a long time without selecting query suggestions ranked at the top. However, the wealth of such implicit negative feedback has not been exploited for designing QAC models. Most existing QAC models rank suggested queries for given prefixes based on certain relevance scores. We take the initiative towards studying implicit negative feed- back during user-QAC interactions. This motivates re-designing QAC in the more general \\\"(static) relevance\\\"(adaptive) implicit negative feedback? framework. We propose a novel adaptive model adaQAC that adapts query auto-completion to users' implicit negative feedback towards unselected query suggestions. We collect user-QAC interaction data and perform large-scale experiments. Empirical results show that implicit negative feedback significantly and consistently boosts the accuracy of the investigated static QAC models that only rely on relevance scores. Our work compellingly makes a key point: QAC should be designed in a more general framework for adapting to implicit negative feedback.\nTitle:\nadaQAC: Adaptive Query Auto-Completion via Implicit Negative Feedback\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this article, we revisit these naive Bayes text classifiers and empirically compare their classification performance on a large number of widely used text classification benchmark datasets. Then, we propose a locally weighted learning approach to these naive Bayes text classifiers. We call our new approach locally weighted naive Bayes text classifiers (LWNBTC). LWNBTC weakens the attribute conditional independence assumption made by these naive Bayes text classifiers by applying the locally weighted learning approach.

This approach is in the spirit of the recently proposed Markov logic networks for machine learning. Its purpose is to learn the soft-constraint logic rules for labeling the components of a scene. In our approach, FOIL (First Order Inductive Learner) is applied to learn the logic rules for MLN and then gradient ascent search is utilized to compute weights attached to each rule for softening the rules. This approach also benefits from the architecture of ToK, in reasoning whether a component in a scene has the right characteristics in order to fulfil the functions a label implies, from the logic point of view. One significant advantage of the proposed approach, rather than the previous versions of ToK, is its automatic logic learning capability such that the manual insertion of logic rules is not necessary. Experiments of labeling the identified components in buildings, for building scene interpretation, illustrate the promise of this approach.\nTitle:\nLearning Logic Rules For The Tower Of Knowledge Using Markov Logic Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this study, we propose a novel approach to generating comparative news summaries. We formulate the task as an optimization problem of selecting proper sentences to maximize the comparativeness within the summary and the representativeness to both news topics.

To monitor the fetal development, imaging data is acquired using (US). Although it is currently the gold-standard in fetal imaging, it might not capture certain abnormalities of the placenta. (MRI) is a safe alternative for the in utero examination while acquiring the fetus data in higher detail. Nevertheless, there is currently no established procedure for assessing the condition of the placenta and consequently the fetal health. Due to maternal respiration and inherent movements of the fetus during examination, a quantitative assessment of the placenta requires fetal motion compensation, precise placenta segmentation and a standardized visualization, which are challenging tasks. Utilizing advanced motion compensation and automatic segmentation methods to extract the highly versatile shape of the placenta, we introduce a novel visualization technique that presents the fetal and maternal side of the placenta in a standardized way. Our approach enables physicians to explore the placenta even in utero. This establishes the basis for a comparative assessment of multiple placentas to analyze possible pathologic arrangements and to support the research and understanding of this vital organ. Additionally, we propose a three-dimensional structure-aware surface slicing technique in order to explore relevant regions inside the placenta. Finally, to survey the applicability of our approach, we consulted clinical experts in prenatal diagnostics and imaging. We received mainly positive feedback, especially the applicability of our technique for research purposes was appreciated.\nTitle:\nPlacenta Maps: In Utero Placental Health Assessment of the Human Fetus.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The algorithm include a local search procedure and optimizes two conflicting objectives of multiclassifiers, a high correct classification rate and a high classification rate for each class, of which the latter is not usually optimized in classification. Once the Pareto front is built, we use two automatic selection methodologies of individuals: the best model with respect to accuracy and the best model with respect to sensitivity (extremes in the Pareto front). These strategies are applied to solve six classification benchmark problems obtained from the UCI repository. The models obtained show a high accuracy and a high classification rate for each class.\nTitle:\nMemetic Pareto Differential Evolution for Designing Artificial Neural Networks in Multiclassification Problems Using Cross-Entropy Versus Sensitivity\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Despite the fact that devices are getting smaller and more powerful, advances in battery technology have not yet reached the stage where devices can autonomously operate for days. At the network layer, routing protocols may balance power consumption at nodes according to their routing decisions. In this paper, an in-depth performance comparison of the DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) and the OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) is presented in terms of energy consumption. Using the ns-2 simulator an evaluation is made of how the different approaches affect the energy use of mobile devices. It was found that a reactive protocol takes advantage of its routing policy when the traffic load is low. However, at higher traffic rates, a proactive routing protocol can perform better with an appropriate refresh parameter. Also, it is demonstrated that independently of the routing protocol selected, the overhearing activity can seriously affect performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first simulation study addressing the power saving issue to extensively compare the DSR and OLSR protocols under a wide variety of networking scenarios.\nTitle:\nOLSR vs DSR: A comparative analysis of proactive and reactive mechanisms from an energetic point of view in wireless ad hoc networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our purpose is to determine what are the key factors affecting Warning Message Dissemination (WMD) in order to concentrate on such parameters, thus reducing the amount of required simulation time when evaluating VANETs. Simulation results show that the key factors affecting warning messages delivery are: (i) the transmission range, (ii) the radio propagation model used, and (iii) the density of vehicles. Based on this statistical analysis, we evaluate a compound key factor: neighbor density. This factor combines the above-mentioned factors into a single entity, reducing the number of factors that must be taken into account for VANET researchers to evaluate the benefits of their proposals.\nTitle:\nDetermining the Representative Factors Affecting Warning Message Dissemination in VANETs\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The main challenge in photo privacy detection is how to generate discriminant features to accurately detect privacy at risk photos. Existing photo privacy detection works, which rely on low-level vision features, are non-informative to the users regarding what privacy information is leaked from their photos. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Privacy-CNH that utilizes hierarchical features which include both object and convolutional features in a deep learning model to detect privacy at risk photos. The generation of object features enables our model to better inform the users about the reason why a photo has privacy risk. The combination of convolutional and object features provide a richer model to understand photo privacy from different aspects, thus improving photo privacy detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art work and the standard convolutional neural network (CNN) with convolutional features on photo privacy detection tasks.\nTitle:\nPrivacy-CNH: A Framework to Detect Photo Privacy with Convolutional Neural Network using Hierarchical Features.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Recent works have shown the feasibility of side-channel attacks against software implementations of MAC-Keccak to retrieve the key, with the security assessment of hardware implementations remaining an open problem. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and practical side-channel analysis of a hardware implementation of MAC-Keccak on FPGA. Different from previous works, we propose a new attack method targeting the first round output of MAC-Keccak rather than the linear operation \u03b8 only. The results on sampled power traces show that the unprotected hardware implementation of MAC-Keccak is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, and attacking the nonlinear operation of MAC-Keccak is very effective. We further discuss countermeasures against side-channel analysis on hardware MAC-Keccak. Finally, we discuss the impact of the key length on side-channel analysis and compare the attack complexity between MAC-Keccak and other cryptographic algorithms.\nTitle:\nSide-channel analysis of MAC-Keccak hardware implementations\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A bridge is needed between these two areas and an explanation on how each of the two approaches can learn from each other. We propose the use of the COIN strategy to solve context disparity and ontology interoperability problems in the emerging Semantic Web both at the ontology level and at the data level. In this work we showcase how the problems that arise from context-dependant representation of facts can be mitigated by Semantic Web techniques, as tools of the conceptual framework developed over 15 years of COIN research.\nTitle:\nImplementing the COntext INterchange (COIN) Approach through Use of Semantic Web Tools\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This paper first highlights some challenges of the new born Big Data paradigm and shows that the increase of the data size has already surpassed the capabilities of today's computation architectures suffering from the limited bandwidth, programmability overhead, energy inefficiency, and limited scalability. Thereafter, the paper introduces a new memristor-based architecture for data-intensive applications. The potential of such an architecture in solving data-intensive problems is illustrated by showing its capability to increase the computation efficiency, solving the communication bottleneck, reducing the leakage currents, etc. Finally, the paper discusses why memristor technology is very suitable for the realization of such an architecture; using memristors to implement dual functions (storage and logic) is illustrated.\nTitle:\nMemristor based computation-in-memory architecture for data-intensive applications\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The playing strength of many Chinese chess programs is at the level of human masters or grandmasters.

It is necessary for a student to understand why he or she loses the game and to receive feedback after practice. In this paper, we propose an intelligent tutoring system for learning Chinese chess.

Our motivation is two-fold. First, we are concerned with how to reason effectively with multiple knowledge bases that have overlap in content. Second, we are concerned with improving the efficiency of reasoning over a set of logical axioms by partitioning the set with respect to some detectable structure, and reasoning over individual partitions either locally or in a distributed fashion. To this end, we provide algorithms for partitioning and reasoning with related logical axioms in propositional and first-order logic.Many of the reasoning algorithms we present are based on the idea of passing messages between partitions. We present algorithms for both forward (data-driven) and backward (query-driven) message passing. Different partitions may have different associated reasoning procedures. We characterize a class of reasoning procedures that ensures completeness and soundness of our message-passing algorithms. We further provide a specialized algorithm for propositional satisfiability checking with partitions. Craig's interpolation theorem serves as a key to proving soundness and completeness of all of these algorithms. An analysis of these algorithms emphasizes parameters of the partitionings that influence the efficiency of computation. We provide a greedy algorithm that automatically decomposes a set of logical axioms into partitions, following this analysis.\nTitle:\nPartition-based logical reasoning for first-order and propositional theories\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The hypercube is one of the most widely discussed topological structures for interconnections between networks and is usually covered in introductions to the basic principles and methods for network design. The exchanged hypercube EH(s, t) is a new variant of the hypercube that has slightly more than half as many edges and retains several valuable and desirable properties of the hypercube. In this paper, we propose an approach for shortest path routing algorithms from the source vertex to the destination vertex in EH(s, t) with time complexity O(n), where n = s + t + 1 and 1 \u2264 s \u2264 t. We focus on edge congestion, which is an important indicator for cost analyses and performance measurements in interconnection networks. Based on our shortest path routing algorithm, we show that the edge congestion of EH(s, t) is 3 \u00b7 2s+t+1\u22122s+1\u22122t+1. In addition, we prove that our shortest path routing algorithm is an optimal routing strategy with respect to the edge congestion of EH(s, t).\nTitle:\nOptimal Edge Congestion of Exchanged Hypercubes\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Library behaviors are hence an integral part of software behaviors. Analyzing them is as important as analyzing the software itself. However, analyzing libraries is highly challenging due to the lack of source code, implementation in different languages, and complex optimizations. We observe that many Java library functions provide excellent documentation, which concisely describes the functionalities of the functions. We develop a novel technique that can construct models for Java API functions by analyzing the documentation. These models are simpler implementations in Java compared to the original ones and hence easier to analyze. More importantly, they provide the same functionalities as the original functions. Our technique successfully models 326 functions from 14 widely used Java classes. We also use these models in static taint analysis on Android apps and dynamic slicing for Java programs, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our models.\nTitle:\nAutomatic model generation from documentation for Java API functions.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The illumination device transmits a spatiotemporal pattern as a series of binary Gray-code patterns. Multiple illumination devices can be combined to localize each marker in 3D at high speed (333Hz). Our method has strengths in accuracy, speed, cost, ambient performance, large working space (1m-5m) and robustness to noise compared with conventional techniques. We compare with a state-of-the-art instrumented glove and vision-based systems to demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and robustness of our approach. We propose a fast and accurate method for hand gesture modeling using an inverse kinematics approach with the six photosensitive markers.

Our GP framework produces XMI-encoded UML models that can easily be loaded into widely available modeling tools, which in turn offer code generation as well as additional analysis and test capabilities.

The objective of this problem is to find a robust optimal solution for a finite set of possible scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel robust optimization approach, called an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm with Stochastic Local Search (EDASLS), to tackle this problem. The proposed method integrates an estimation of distribution algorithm with a novel two phase stochastic local search procedure to minimize the maximal total cost over a set of different scenarios. The stochastic local search procedure avoids excessive fitness evaluations of unpromising moves in local search. Our experimental results on two sets of benchmark problems (a total of 55 problem instances) showed that the proposed approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art algorithms.\nTitle:\nEstimation of Distribution Algorithm with Stochastic Local Search for Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid user interface for knowledge workers to support document spaces and corresponding visualizations. We propose a combined 2D + 3D interface to support both visualization approaches and interaction metaphors to their maximum potential. Interaction is matched due to the principle of dimensional congruence and a thorough investigation of previous approaches and problems is given.

A pipeline model of the flow visualization process is used as a basis for presentation.

Starting from a set of standard mappings partly based on equivalents from experimental visualization, a number of data preparation techniques is described, to prepare the flow data for visualization. Next, a number of perceptual effects and rendering techniques are described, and some problems in visual presentation are discussed.

To guarantee the success of greedy forwarding, many research efforts assign virtual coordinates to nodes to obtain a greedy embedding of the network. Different from these existing efforts, this paper presents an approach that enables greedy forwarding to succeed in directional wireless networks by selecting links in the network instead of assigning virtual coordinates to the nodes. Specifically, this paper studies the following problem: given a set of nodes on the Euclidean plane, how can we add a minimum number of point-to-point links, such that the greedy forwarding algorithm succeeds on the resulting network. The motivation for studying this problem is that each point-to-point link in directional wireless networks is realized by a pair of directional antennas, so minimizing the number of links will reduce the network installation cost. This paper first presents the properties of the graphs supporting greedy forwarding, and then solves the above problem optimally by Integer Linear Programming and also sub-optimally by a polynomial-time 3-approximation algorithm. Finally, this paper compares the polynomial-time algorithm with the optimal solution, showing that the polynomial-time algorithm can actually generate within 1.1 times the number of links found by the optimal solution in most cases.\nTitle:\nOn graphs supporting greedy forwarding for directional wireless networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Commonly deployed link state routing protocols such as OSPF react to link failures through global link state advertisements and routing table recomputations causing significant forwarding discontinuity after a failure. Careful tuning of various parameters to accelerate routing convergence may cause instability when the majority of failures are transient. To enhance failure resiliency without jeopardizing routing stability, we propose a local rerouting based approach called failure insensitive routing. The proposed approach prepares for failures using interface-specific forwarding, and upon a failure, suppresses the link state advertisement and instead triggers local rerouting using a backwarding table. With this approach, when no more than one link failure notification is suppressed, a packet is guaranteed to be forwarded along a loop-free path to its destination if such a path exists. This paper demonstrates the feasibility, reliability, and stability of our approach.\nTitle:\nFast local rerouting for handling transient link failures\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The first notion was introduced by Gehrlein: A committee is stable if each committee member is preferred to each non-member by a (possibly weak) majority of voters. The second notion is called local stability (introduced in this paper): A size-$k$ committee is locally stable in an election with $n$ voters if there is no candidate $c$ and no group of more than $frac{n}{k+1}$ voters such that each voter in this group prefers $c$ to each committee member. We argue that Gehrlein-stable committees are appropriate for shortlisting tasks, and that locally stable committees are better suited for applications that require proportional representation. The goal of this paper is to analyze these notions in detail, explore their compatibility with notions of proportionality, and investigate the computational complexity of related algorithmic tasks.\nTitle:\nThe Condorcet Principle for Multiwinner Elections: From Shortlisting to Proportionality.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The nonlinear diffusion method uses a so-called additive operator splitting (AOS) scheme. This algorithm is very efficient, but requires frequent data exchanges. Our focus was to provide different data decomposition techniques which allow for achieving high efficiency for different hardware platforms. Depending on the available communication performance, our parallelization schemes allow for high scalability when using fast System Area Networks (SAN), but also provide significant performance enhancements on slower interconnects by optimizing data structures and communication patterns. Performance results are presented for a variety of commodity hardware platforms. Our most important result is a speedup factor of 210 using 256 processors of a high end cluster equipped with Myrinet.\nTitle:\nLow Level Parallelization of Nonlinear Diffusion Filtering Algorithms for Cluster Computing Environments\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Such environments support the entire process of investigating, implementing, analyzing and evaluating new techniques, thus identifying in a concrete way which techniques are truly practical and robust. In this paper we present a video database research initiative that culminated in the successful development of VDBMS, a video database research platform that supports comprehensive and efficient database management for digital video. We describe key video processing components of the system and illustrate the value of VDBMS as a research platform by describing several research projects carried out within the VDBMS environment. These include MPEG7 document support for video feature import and export, a new query operator for optimal multi-feature image similarity matching, secure access control for streaming video, and the mining of medical video data using hierarchical content organization.\nTitle:\nA Video Database Management System for Advancing Video Database Research\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

An important methodological problem, on which several papers appeared in the literature, is to provide a reasonable classification of the measures. In this paper, we explore Boolean factor analysis, which uses formal concepts corresponding to classes of measures as factors, for the purpose of clustering of the measures. Unlike the existing studies, our method reveals overlapping clusters of interestingness measures. We argue that the overlap between clusters is a desired feature of natural groupings of measures and that because formal concepts are used as factors in Boolean factor analysis, the resulting clusters have a clear meaning and are easy to interpret. We conduct three case studies on clustering of measures, provide interpretations of the resulting clusters and compare the results to those of the previous approaches reported in the literature.\nTitle:\nBoolean factors as a means of clustering of interestingness measures of association rules.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The question then arises: which is the most appropriate algorithm to apply. Recently, we proposed a new algorithm for making such a selection based on landmarking - a meta-learning strategy that utilises meta-features that are measurements based on efficient learning algorithms. This algorithm, which creates a set of landmarkers that each utilise subsets of the algorithms being landmarked, was shown to be able to estimate accuracy well, even when employing a small fraction of the given algorithms. However, that version of the algorithm has exponential computational complexity for training. In this paper, we propose a hill-climbing version of the landmarker generation algorithm, which requires only polynomial training time complexity. Our experiments show that the landmarkers formed have similar results to the more complex version of the algorithm.\nTitle:\nA Hill-Climbing Landmarker Generation Algorithm Based on Efficiency and Correlativity Criteria\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This low reuse means that its performance is bounded by main-memory bandwidth. Moreover, the random patterns of indirection make it difficult to achieve this bound. We present sparse matrix storage formats based on deduplicated memory. These formats reduce memory traffic during SpMV and thus show significantly improved performance bounds: 90x better in the best case. Additionally, we introduce a matrix format that inherently exploits any amount of matrix symmetry and is at the same time fully compatible with non-symmetric matrix code. Because of this, our method can concurrently operate on a symmetric matrix without complicated work partitioning schemes and without any thread synchronization or locking. This approach takes advantage of growing processor caches, but incurs an instruction count overhead. It is feasible to overcome this issue by using specialized hardware as shown by the recently proposed Hierarchical Immutable Content-Addressable Memory Processor, or HICAMP architecture.\nTitle:\nSparse matrix-vector multiply on the HICAMP architecture\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It has been shown that under perfect symbol synchronization, parallel relays with space-time modulation can yield more than 10 dB power savings over conventional serial relays in a highly mobile environment. We analyze the effect of synchronization errors on the performance of parallel relays, and also study several effective methods to reduce the negative impact of synch errors. Our study shows that when the synch errors are much smaller than a symbol interval, the performance of parallel relays deteriorates gracefully. We have also found that well designed space-time coding techniques, such as TR-STC and ST-OFDM, can be highly effective in combating large synch errors with only marginal reduction of data rate.\nTitle:\nCombating synchronization errors in cooperative relays\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This paper first gives an overview over approaches for leveraging strengths of different techniques, algorithms, and tools in order to increase the power and abilities of the state of the art in software verification.

Although similar in structure to traditional histograms, these histograms infer data distributions not by examining the data or a sample thereof, but by using feedback from the query execution engine about the actual selectivity of range selection operators to progressively refine the histogram. Since the cost of building and maintaining self-tuning histograms is independent of the data size, self-tuning histograms provide a remarkably inexpensive way to construct histograms for large data sets with little up-front costs. Self-tuning histograms are particularly attractive as an alternative to multi-dimensional traditional histograms that capture dependencies between attributes but are prohibitively expensive to build and maintain. In this paper, we describe the techniques for initializing and refining self-tuning histograms. Our experimental results show that self-tuning histograms provide a low-cost alternative to traditional multi-dimensional histograms with little loss of accuracy for data distributions with low to moderate skew.\nTitle:\nSelf-tuning histograms: building histograms without looking at data\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Existing LBS-based systems require users to type in complete keywords. However for mobile users it is rather difficult to type in complete keywords on mobile devices. To alleviate this problem, in this paper we study the location-aware instant search problem, which returns users location-aware answers as users type in queries letter by letter. The main challenge is to achieve high interactive speed. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel index structure, prefix-region tree (called PR-Tree), to efficiently support location-aware instant search. PR-Tree is a tree-based index structure which seamlessly integrates the textual description and spatial information to index the spatial data. Using the PR-Tree, we develop efficient algorithms to support single prefix queries and multi-keyword queries. Experiments show that our method achieves high performance and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\nTitle:\nLocation-aware instant search\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

CLARA uses static typestate analyses to automatically convert any AspectJ monitoring aspect into a residual runtime monitor that only monitors events triggered by program locations that the analyses failed to prove safe. If the static analysis succeeds on all locations, this gives strong static guarantees. If not, the efficient residual runtime monitor is guaranteed to capture property violations at runtime. Researchers can use CLARA with most runtime-monitoring tools that implement monitors as AspectJ aspects. In this tutorial supplement, we provide references to related reading material that will allow the reader to obtain in-depth knowledge about the context in which CLARA can be applied and about the techniques that underlie the CLARA framework.\nTitle:\nClara: partially evaluating runtime monitors at compile time tutorial supplement\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Previous and related work has shown that runtime monitoring techniques can be useful in order to validate or guarantee the safety and security of running programs. Those techniques have however not been incorporated in everyday software development processes. One problem that hinders industry adoption is that the required specifications use a cumbersome, textual notation. As a consequence, only verification experts, not programmers, can understand what a given specification means and in particular, whether it is correct. In 2001, researchers at Bell Labs proposed the Timeline formalism. This formalism was designed with ease of use in mind, for the purpose of static verification (and not, as in our work, for runtime monitoring). In this article, we describe how software safety specifications can be described visually in the Timeline formalism and subsequently transformed into finite automata suitable for runtime monitoring, using our meta-modelling and model transformation tool AToM3. The synthesized automata are subsequently fed into an existing monitoring back-end that generates efficient runtime monitors for them. Those monitors can then automatically be applied to Java programs. Our work shows that the transformation of Timeline models to automata is not only feasible in an efficient and sound way but also helps programmers identify correspondences between the original specification and the generated monitors. We argue that visual specification of safety criteria and subsequent automatic synthesis of runtime monitors will help users reason about the correctness of their specifications on the one hand and effectively deploy them in industrial settings on the other hand.\nTitle:\nTransforming Timeline Specifications into Automata for Runtime Monitoring\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, few if any tools exist that enable real-time formative assessment of in-class programming tasks. The proposed REACT (Real Time Evaluation and Assessment of Computational Thinking) system is a first step toward allowing teachers to see which high-level concepts students have mastered and which ones they are struggling with as students code in real time.

Our goal is to perform the permutation quickly using only a polylogarithmic number of bits of extra storage. The main result is an algorithm whose worst case running time is $O(n \\log n)$ and that uses $O(\\log n )$ additional $\\log n$-bit words of memory. A simpler method is presented for the case in which both the permutation and its inverse can be computed at (amortised) unit cost. This algorithm requires $O(n \\log n)$ time and $O(1)$ words in the worst case. These results are extended to the situation in which we are to apply a power of the permutation. A linear time, $O(1)$ word method is presented for the special case in which the data values are all distinct and are either initially in sorted order or will be when permuted.\nTitle:\nPermuting In Place\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We aim at checking basic memory consistency properties (no null pointer assignments, etc.) and shape invariants whose violation can be expressed in an existential fragment of a first order logic over graphs. We formalise this fragment as a logic for specifying bad memory patterns whose formulae may be translated to testers written in C that can be attached to the program, thus reducing the verification problem considered to checking reachability of an error control line. We encode configurations of programs, which are essentially shape graphs, in an original way as extended tree automata and we represent program statements by tree transducers. Then, we use the abstract regular tree model checking framework for a fully automated verification.

A promising class of concurrency abstractions replaces explicit concurrency mechanisms with a single linguistic mechanism that combines state and control and uses asynchronous messages for communications, e.g. active objects or actors, but that doesn't remove the hurdle of understanding non-local control transfer. What if the programming model enabled programmers to simply do what they do best, that is, to describe a system in terms of its modular structure and write sequential code to implement the operations of those modules and handles details of concurrency? In a recently sponsored NSF project we are developing such a model that we call capsule-oriented programming and its realization in the Panini project. This model favors modularity over explicit concurrency, encourages concurrency correctness by construction, and exploits modular structure of programs to expose implicit concurrency.\n\n\nTitle:\nCapsule-oriented programming\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Event based control systems have been proposed to overcome the instability caused by the random time delay. High latency at the transport layer can still impede effective and reliable execution of tasks with high dexterity requirements. Network QoS based dynamic resource allocation has been proposed to increase the efficiency and reliability of task execution. However, these approaches only try to mitigate or overcome the effects of random time delay and do not address the cause of latency issues in the communication channel.This paper addresses the efficiency and reliability requirements for supermedia enhanced teleoperated systems by reducing the end-to-end transmission latency through the use of overlay networks. The proposed system reduces the transmission latency by using multiple, disjoint paths in overlay networks. The proposed system facilitates reliable and efficient task completion for tasks with high dexterity requirements. Experimental validation of the proposed teleoperated system using the PlanetLab Network is provided for the task of teleoperating a mobile manipulator system.\nTitle:\nImproving The Operation Efficiency Of Supermedia Enhanced Internet Based Teleoperation Via An Overlay Network\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In many business simulations however, educators and researchers lack support in observing how the simulated actors operationalize their strategies, in validating whether operations have been aligned with the strategy, and also in (re)configuring available player and opponent strategies based on new theoretical or practical insights. This paper specifies requirements for a novel business simulation architecture that facilitates transparency, consistency and modularity of strategic decision making by simulated actors in interactive business simulations. A system architecture is proposed that integrates three components: an extensible agent middleware, a distributed simulation engine and a modular reasoning framework. How the architecture fulfills the three requirements of strategic reasoning transparency, consistency and modularity is illustrated in a use case of a business simulation game for supply chain management education.\nTitle:\nTransparency, consistency and modularity of strategic reasoning: an agent architecture for interactive business simulations\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Designing software services and composing services in order to form applications or composite services requires abstractions beyond those found in typical object-oriented programming languages. In this paper, we explore a number of the abstractions used in service-oriented computing and related Internet- and web-based programming models in the context of Creol, an executable concurrent object-oriented modeling language with active objects and futures; i.e., features capable of expressing and dealing with asynchronous actions. By adding various abstractions to the modeling language, we demonstrate how a concurrent object language may naturally address many of the requirements of service-oriented computing. The study of language extensions in the restricted setting of a small, high-level modeling language, such as Creol, suggests a cheap way of developing new abstractions for emerging application domains. In this paper, we explore abstractions in the context of service-oriented computing, particularly with regard to dynamic aspects such as service discovery and structuring mechanisms such as groups.\nTitle:\nConcurrent objects \u00e0 la carte\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We found little evidence of differences in strategy between younger and older participants matched on fluid intelligence. Both performance and strategy differences were found between older participants having higher versus lower fluid intelligence, however, suggesting that cognitive factors, rather than age per se, exert the dominant influence.

This paper reports on a more detailed study with (a) data from more than three times as many students, (b) analysis of performance changes in incorrect answers, (c) some problems in which the Bootstrap scaffolds have been removed, and (d) an IRT analysis across the elements of Bootstrap's program-design pedagogy. Our results confirm that students improve on algebraic word problems after completing the module, even on unscaffolded problems.

Existing methods often seek to minimize the distribution divergence between domains, such as the marginal distribution, the conditional distribution or both. However, these two distances are often treated equally in existing algorithms, which will result in poor performance in real applications. Moreover, existing methods usually assume that the dataset is balanced, which also limits their performances on imbalanced tasks that are quite common in real problems. To tackle the distribution adaptation problem, in this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach, named as Balanced Distribution Adaptation (BDA), which can adaptively leverage the importance of the marginal and conditional distribution discrepancies, and several existing methods can be treated as special cases of BDA. Based on BDA, we also propose a novel Weighted Balanced Distribution Adaptation (W-BDA) algorithm to tackle the class imbalance issue in transfer learning. W-BDA not only considers the distribution adaptation between domains but also adaptively changes the weight of each class. To evaluate the proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on several transfer learning tasks, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms over several state-of-the-art methods.\nTitle:\nBalanced Distribution Adaptation for Transfer Learning.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we tackle this open problem by investigating a search-based face annotation (SBFA) paradigm for mining large amounts of web facial images freely available on the WWW. Given a query facial image for annotation, the idea of SBFA is to first search for top-n similar facial images from a web facial image database and then exploit these top-ranked similar facial images and their weak labels for naming the query facial image. To fully mine those information, this paper proposes a novel framework of Learning to Name Faces (L2NF) -- a unified multimodal learning approach for search-based face annotation, which consists of the following major components: (i) we enhance the weak labels of top-ranked similar images by exploiting the \"label smoothness\" assumption; (ii) we construct the multimodal representations of a facial image by extracting different types of features; (iii) we optimize the distance measure for each type of features using distance metric learning techniques; and finally (iv) we learn the optimal combination of multiple modalities for annotation through a learning to rank scheme. We conduct a set of extensive empirical studies on two real-world facial image databases, in which encouraging results show that the proposed algorithms significantly boost the naming accuracy of search-based face annotation task.\nTitle:\nLearning to name faces: a multimodal learning scheme for search-based face annotation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Fueling that growth is the availability of independent web services that can be cost-effectively composed with other services to provide richer functionality. The reasons that make these systems easier to build, however, also make them more challenging to test. Independent web services usually provide just an interface, enough to invoke them and develop some general (black-box) tests, but insufficient for a tester to develop an adequate understanding of the integration quality between the application and independent web services. To address this lack we propose a \"whitening\" approach to make web services more transparent through the addition of an intermediate coverage service. The approach, named Service Oriented Coverage Testing (SOCT), provides a tester with feedback about how a whitened service, called a Testable Service, is exercised. In this paper we introduce the SOCT approach, implement an instance of it, and perform a preliminary study to show its feasibility and potential value. SOCT enables SOA white-box testing, while maintaining SOA flexibility, dynamism and loose coupling.\nTitle:\nWhitening SOA testing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We here show that computationally less expensive features can achieve the same performance in the common scenario in which the data is available as a sequence of interactions. Our features are based on social vector clocks, an adaptation of the vector-clock concept introduced in distributed computing to social interaction networks. In fact, our experiments suggest that by taking into account the order and spacing of interactions, social vector clocks exploit different aspects of link formation so that their combination with previous approaches yields the most accurate predictor to date.\nTitle:\nLink prediction with social vector clocks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This paper deals with a prominent type of automated negotiations, namely, multilateral multi-issue negotiation that runs under real-time constraints and in which the negotiating agents have no prior knowledge about their opponents' preferences over the space of negotiation outcomes. We propose a novel negotiation approach which enables an agent to reach an efficient agreement with multiple opponents. The proposed approach achieves that goal by, 1) employing sparse pseudo-input Gaussian processes to model the behavior of opponents, 2) learning fuzzy opponent preferences to increase the satisfaction of other parties, and 3) adopting an adaptive decision-making mechanism to handle uncertainty in negotiation. The experimental results show, both from the standard mean-score perspective and the perspective of empirical game theory, that the agent applying the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art negotiation agents from the recent Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) in a variety of negotiation domains.\nTitle:\nToward Efficient Agreements in Real-Time Multilateral Agent-Based Negotiations\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The high dynamics of the domain as well as the nature of the source data, that are textual rather than numerical, require specific techniques both for modeling data and managing a project. Despite the increasing diffusion of Social Business Intelligence applications, only few works in the academic literature addressed such distinguishing features. In this paper we propose both a modeling technique and a methodology that enable the possibility of carrying out a more dynamic and expressive design in Social Business Intelligence projects.

Being able to predict the most likely next queries would provide a way to recommend interesting queries to users on the one hand, and could improve the efficiency of OLAP sessions on the other. In particular, query recommendation would proactively guide users in data exploration and improve the quality of their interactive experience. In this paper, we propose a framework to predict the most likely next query and recommend this to the user. Our framework relies on a probabilistic user behavior model built by analyzing previous OLAP sessions and exploiting a query similarity metric. To gain insight in the recommendation precision and on what parameters it depends, we evaluate our approach using different quality assessments.\nTitle:\nPredicting Your Next OLAP Query Based on Recent Analytical Sessions\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Although SRC has good discriminative ability, its performance strongly depends on the quality of the training data. In fact, palmprint images do not only contain identity information but they also have other information such as illumination and distortions due the acquisition conditions. In this case, SRC may not be able to classify the identity of palmprint well in the original space since samples from the same class show large variations. To overcome this problem, we propose in this work to exploit sparse-and-dense hybrid representation (SDR) for palmprint identification. Indeed, this type of representations that are based on the dictionary learning from the training data has shown its great advantage to overcome the limitations of SRC. Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly available palmprint datasets: multispectral and PolyU. The obtained results clearly show the ability of the proposed method to outperform both the state-of-the-art holistic approaches and the coding palmprint identification methods.\nTitle:\nPalmprint identification using sparse and dense hybrid representation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our approach is uniquely designed to capture the rich topology of topic evolution inherent in the corpus. Instead of characterizing the evolving topics at fixed time points, we conceptually define a topic as a quantized unit of evolutionary change in content and discover topics with the time of their appearance in the corpus. Discovered topics are then connected to form a topic evolution graph using a measure derived from the underlying document network. Our approach allows inhomogeneous distribution of topics over time and does not impose any topological restriction in topic evolution graphs. We evaluate our algorithm on the ACM corpus. The topic evolution graphs obtained from the ACM corpus provide an effective and concrete summary of the corpus with remarkably rich topology that are congruent to our background knowledge. In a finer resolution, the graphs reveal concrete information about the corpus that were previously unknown to us, suggesting the utility of our approach as a navigational tool for the corpus.\nTitle:\nThe web of topics: discovering the topology of topic evolution in a corpus\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A network consists of entities connected by links representing relations such as friendship, communication, or shared activity. Maintaining privacy when publishing networked data is uniquely challenging because an individual's network context can be used to identify them even if other identifying information is removed. In this paper, we quantify the privacy risks associated with three classes of attacks on the privacy of individuals in networks, based on the knowledge used by the adversary. We show that the risks of these attacks vary greatly based on network structure and size. We propose a novel approach to anonymizing network data that models aggregate network structure and then allows samples to be drawn from that model. The approach guarantees anonymity for network entities while preserving the ability to estimate a wide variety of network measures with relatively little bias.\nTitle:\nResisting structural re-identification in anonymized social networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The testing method has originally assumed that an implementation of each processing function or relation is proven to be correct before the actual testing can take place. Such a limitation has been removed in a subsequent paper, but only for deterministic X-machines. This paper extends this result to non-deterministic stream X-machines and considers a conformance relationship between a specification and an implementation, rather than mere equivalence. Furthermore, it shows how this method can be applied to test a P system by building a suitable stream X-machine from the derivation tree associated with a partial computation.\nTitle:\nTesting Non-deterministic Stream X-machine Models and P systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Up to this point, research on differentially private data analysis has focused on the setting of a trusted curator holding a large, static, data set; thus every computation is a \"one-shot\" object: there is no point in computing something twice, since the result will be unchanged, up to any randomness introduced for privacy. However, many applications of data analysis involve repeated computations, either because the entire goal is one of monitoring, e.g., of traffic conditions, search trends, or incidence of influenza, or because the goal is some kind of adaptive optimization, e.g., placement of data to minimize access costs. In these cases, the algorithm must permit continual observation of the system's state. We therefore initiate a study of differential privacy under continual observation. We identify the problem of maintaining a counter in a privacy preserving manner and show its wide applicability to many different problems.\nTitle:\nDifferential privacy under continual observation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For example, we can easily read a newspaper while drinking coffee. This latter activity takes place in our background or periphery of attention. Contrarily, interactions with computing technology usually require focused attention. With interactive technologies becoming increasingly present in the everyday environment, it is essential to explore how these technologies could be developed such that people can interact with them both in the focus and in the periphery of attention. This upcoming field of Peripheral Interaction aims to fluently embed interactive technology into everyday life.

In practice, these problems are generally large-scale, non-linear, subject to uncertainties, and combine both continuous and discrete variables. In the recent years, a number of complementary theoretical advances in addressing such problems have been obtained in the field of applied mathematics. The paper introduces a selection of these advances in the fields of non-convex optimization, in mixed-integer programming, and in optimization under uncertainty. The practical relevance of these developments for power systems planning and operation are discussed, and the opportunities for combining them, together with high-performance computing and big data infrastructures, as well as novel machine learning and randomized algorithms, are highlighted.\nTitle:\nAdvanced optimization methods for power systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The effect of combining tuples or triples of the objective functions are investigated in systematic experiments, in particular which of the objectives are partially conflicting. A selection of generated maps are visually evaluated by a population of skilled StarCraft players, confirming that most of our objectives correspond to perceived gameplay qualities.

The approach is similar to that used to model updates and nondeterminism in active database rules. We begin by showing that planning problems can be automatically converted to Datalog1S programs with nondeterministic choice constructs, for which we provide a formal semantics using the concept of stable models. The resulting programs are characterized by a syntactic structure (XY-stratification) that makes them amenable to efficient implementation using compilation and fixpoint computation techniques developed for deductive database systems. We first develop the approach for sequential plans, and then we illustrate its flexibility and expressiveness by formalizing a model for parallel plans, where several actions can be executed simultaneously. The characterization of parallel plans as partially ordered plans allows us to develop (parallel) versions of partially ordered plans that can often be executed faster than the original partially ordered plans.\nTitle:\nA Deductive Database Approach to A.I.

Recently, it has been shown that it is not always possible to forget a set of atoms from a program while obeying this property, and a precise criterion regarding what can be forgotten has been presented, accompanied by a class of forgetting operators that return the correct result when forgetting is possible. However, it is an open question what to do when we have to forget a set of atoms, but cannot without violating this property. In this paper, we address this issue and investigate three natural alternatives to forget when forgetting without violating strong persistence is not possible, which turn out to correspond to the different possible relaxations of the characterization of strong persistence. Additionally, we discuss their preferable usage, shed light on the relation between forgetting and notions of relativized equivalence established earlier in the context of Answer Set Programming, and present a detailed study on their computational complexity.\nTitle:\nWhen You Must Forget: beyond strong persistence when forgetting in answer set programming.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In the multi-criteria MST (mc-MST) problem, the scalar edge weights of the MST problem are replaced by vectors, and the aim is to find the complete set of Pareto optimal minimum-weight spanning trees. This problem is NP-hard and so approximate methods must be used if one is to tackle it efficiently. In an article previously published in this journal, a genetic algorithm (GA) was put forward for the mc-MST. To evaluate the GA, the solution sets generated by it were compared with solution sets from a proposed (exponential time) algorithm for enumerating all Pareto optimal spanning trees. However, the proposed enumeration algorithm that was used is not correct for two reasons: (1) It does not guarantee that all Pareto optimal minimum-weight spanning trees are returned. (2) It does not guarantee that those trees that are returned are Pareto optimal. In this short paper we prove these two theorems.\nTitle:\nEnumeration of Pareto optimal multi-criteria spanning trees - a proof of the incorrectness of Zhou and Gen's proposed algorithm\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we perform a careful study on the recently proposed visual summarization approaches, including the thumbnail of the web page snapshot, the internal image in the web page which is representative of the content in the page, and the visual snippet which is a synthesized image based on the internal image, the title, and the logo found in the web page. Moreover, since the internal image based summarization approach hardly works when the representative internal images are unavailable, we propose a new strategy, which retrieves the representative image from the external to summarize the web page. The experimental results suggest that the various summarization approaches have respective advantages on different types of web pages. While internal images and thumbnails can provide a reliable summarization on web pages with dominant images and web pages with simple structure respectively, the external images are regarded as a useful information to complement the internal images and are demonstrated very useful in helping users understanding new web pages . The visual snippet performs well on the re-finding tasks since it incorporates the title and logo which are advantageous on identifying the visited web pages.\nTitle:\nVisual summarization of web pages\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

More specifically, predictive self-adaptation attempts to anticipate actions for reacting to potential changes in a system, over time. Nevertheless, the execution of different adaptation strategies on the operational level can produce an unexpected impact on the organizational level. Predicting this impact, mainly in terms of time and cost involved in the adaptation, might be useful to enhance the decision-making process in a business strategic/tactic context.

Our focus is on the \"economic behavior\" of the network nodes the pricing and purchasing strategies of the access point, wireless relaying nodes, and clients. We use a \"game theoretic approach\" to analyze their interactions from one-hop to multihop network and when the network has an unlimited or limited channel capacity. We show that the access point and relaying wireless nodes will adopt a simple, yet optimal, fixed-rate pricing strategy in a multi-hop network with an unlimited capacity. Yet, the fixed-rate pricing strategy fails to be optimal in the limited capacity case. To this end, we focus on the access point adopting a more practical \"fixedrate, non-interrupted service\" model and propose an algorithm based on the Markovian decision theory to devise the optimal pricing strategy.\nTitle:\nOn the Access Pricing Issues of Wireless Mesh Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The recent industrial adoption of Semantic Web techniques, which rely on ontologies, has led to the increased importance of the ontology evolution research. Typical approaches to ontology evolution are designed as multiple-stage processes combining techniques from a variety of fields (e.g., natural language processing and reasoning). However, the few existing surveys on this topic lack an in-depth analysis of the various stages of the ontology evolution process. This survey extends the literature by adopting a process-centric view of ontology evolution. Accordingly, we first provide an overall process model synthesized from an overview of the existing models in the literature. Then we survey the major approaches to each of the steps in this process and conclude on future challenges for techniques aiming to solve that particular stage.\nTitle:\nOntology evolution: a process-centric survey.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

These two goals are not easy to reconcile, especially if one also aims at high assurances for correctness. In this paper, we describe a combination of Isabelle/HOL with a proof-producing SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver that contains a SAT engine and a decision procedure for quantifier-free first-order logic with equality. As a result, a user benefits from the expressiveness of Isabelle/HOL when modeling a system, but obtains much better automation for those fragments of the proofs that fall within the scope of the (automatic) SMT solver. Soundness is not compromised because all proofs are submitted to the trusted kernel of Isabelle for certification.

This makes weak supervision attractive, using weak or noisy signals like the output of heuristic methods or user click-through data for training. In a semi-supervised setting, we can use a large set of data with weak labels to pretrain a neural  and then fine-tune the parameters with a small amount of data with true labels. This feels intuitively sub-optimal as these two independent stages leave the model unaware about the varying label quality. What if we could somehow inform the model about the label quality? In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method where we train two neural networks in a multi-task fashion: a  network and a  network. The target  is optimized to perform a given task and is trained using a large set of unlabeled data that are weakly annotated. We propose to weight the gradient updates to the target  using the scores provided by the second confidence network, which is trained on a small amount of supervised data. Thus we avoid that the weight updates computed from noisy labels harm the quality of the target  model. We evaluate our learning strategy on two different tasks: document ranking and sentiment classification. The results demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the performance compared to the baselines but also speeds up the learning process from weak labels.\nTitle:\nAvoiding Your Teacher's Mistakes: Training Neural Networks with Controlled Weak Supervision.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Using screen readers for conducting online transactions can cause considerable information overload, because transactions, such as shopping and paying bills, typically involve a number of steps spanning several web pages. One can combat this overload by using a transaction model for web accessibility that presents only fragments of web pages that are needed for doing transactions. We can realize such a model by coupling a process automaton, encoding states of a transaction, with concept classifiers that identify page fragments \"relevant\" to a particular state of the transaction. In this paper we present a fully automated process that synergistically combines several techniques for transforming unlabeled click-stream data generated by transactions into a transactionmodel. These techniques include web content analysis to partition a web page into segments consisting of semantically related content, contextual analysis of data surrounding clickable objects in a page, and machine learning methods, such as clustering of page segments based on contextual analysis, statistical classification, and automata learning. The use of unlabeled click streams in building transaction models has important benefits: (i) visually impaired users do not have to depend on sighted users for creating manually labeled training data to construct the models; (ii) it is possible to mine personalized models from unlabeled transaction click-streams associated with sites that visually impaired users visit regularly; (iii) since unlabeled data is relatively easy to obtain, it is feasible to scale up the construction of domain-specific transaction models (e.g., separate models for shopping, airline reservations, bill payments, etc.); (iv) adjusting the performance of deployed models over timtime with new training data is also doable. We provide preliminary experimental evidence of the practical effectiveness of both domain-specific, as well as personalized accessibility transaction models built using our approach. Finally, this approach is applicable for building transaction models for mobile devices with limited-size displays, as well as for creating wrappers for information extraction from web sites.\nTitle:\nAutomated construction of web accessibility models from transaction click-streams\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Secure electrical power supply requires, together with careful operation, a robust design of the electrical power grid topology. Currently, the impact of the topology on grid robustness is mainly assessed by purely topological approaches, that fail to capture the essence of electric power flow. This paper proposes a metric, the effective graph resistance, to relate the topology of a power grid to its robustness against cascading failures by deliberate attacks, while also taking the fundamental characteristics of the electric power grid into account such as power flow allocation according to Kirchhoff laws. Experimental verification on synthetic power systems shows that the proposed metric reflects the grid robustness accurately. The proposed metric is used to optimize a grid topology for a higher level of robustness. To demonstrate its applicability, the metric is applied on the IEEE 118 bus power system to improve its robustness against cascading failures.\nTitle:\nThe Impact of the Topology on Cascading Failures in Electric Power Grids.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Current applications must contain significant network binding and protocol logic, which makes them inflexible to the dynamic networking environments facing mobile devices. Haggle allows separating application logic from transport bindings so that applications can be communication agnostic. Internally, the Haggle framework provides a mechanism for late-binding interfaces, names, protocols, and resources for network communication. This separation allows applications to easily utilize multiple communication modes and methods across infrastructure and infrastructure-less environments. We provide a prototype implementation of the Haggle framework and evaluate it by demonstrating support for two existing legacy applications, email and web browsing. Haggle makes it possible for these applications to seamlessly utilize mobile networking opportunities both with and without infrastructure.\nTitle:\nHaggle: seamless networking for mobile applications\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, this neglects that in typical applications, edges have varying importance. We consider the problem OptimalFlexDraw that is defined as follows. Given a planar graph G on n vertices with maximum degree 4 (4-planar graph) and for each edge e a cost function ${\\rm cost}_{e}: \\mathbb{N}_{0} \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ defining costs depending on the number of bends e has, compute an orthogonal drawing of G of minimum cost. In this generality OptimalFlexDraw is NP-hard. We show that it can be solved efficiently if 1) the cost function of each edge is convex and 2) the first bend on each edge does not cause any cost. Our algorithm takes time O(n \u00b7Tflow(n)) and O(n2 \u00b7Tflow(n)) for biconnected and connected graphs, respectively, where Tflow(n) denotes the time to compute a minimum-cost flow in a planar network with multiple sources and sinks. Our result is the first polynomial-time bend-optimization algorithm for general 4-planar graphs optimizing over all embeddings.

We show that all of these semantics are natural generalizations of the corresponding semantics for logic programs without priority.

MapReduce borrows from functional programming, where programmer defines Map and Reduce tasks executed on large set of distributed data. In this paper we propose an implementation of the MapReduce programming model. We present the architecture of the prototype based on Bit Dew, a middleware for large scale data management on Desktop Grid. We describe the set of features which makes our approach suitable for large scale and loosely connected Internet Desktop Grid: massive fault tolerance, replica management, barriers-free execution, latency-hiding optimisation as well as distributed result checking. We also present performance evaluation of the prototype both against micro-benchmarks and real MapReduce application. The scalability test shows that we achieve linear speedup on the classical Word Count benchmark. Several scenarios involving lagger hosts and host crashes demonstrate that the prototype is able to cope with an experimental context similar to real-world Internet.\nTitle:\nTowards MapReduce for Desktop Grid Computing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we propose a multilevel checkpoint model by taking into account uncertain execution scales (different numbers of processes/cores). The contribution is threefold: (1) we provide an in-depth analysis on why it is difficult to derive the optimal checkpoint intervals for different checkpoint levels and optimize the number of cores simultaneously; (2) we devise a novel method that can quickly obtain an optimized solution---the first successful attempt in multilevel checkpoint models with uncertain scales; and (3) we perform both large-scale real experiments and extreme-scale numerical simulation to validate the effectiveness of our design.

The Internet Engineering Task Force has been working for developing efficient IPv6 mobility management protocols. As a result, Mobile IPv6 and its extensions such as Fast Mobile IPv6 and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 have been developed as host-based mobility management protocols. While the host-based mobility management protocols were being enhanced, the network-based mobility management protocols such as Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and Fast Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FPMIPv6) have been standardized. In this paper, we analyze and compare existing IPv6 mobility management protocols including the recently standardized PMIPv6 and FPMIPv6. We identify each IPv6 mobility management protocol's characteristics and performance indicators by examining handover operations. Then, we analyze the performance of the IPv6 mobility management protocols in terms of handover latency, handover blocking probability, and packet loss. Through the conducted numerical results, we summarize considerations for handover performance.\nTitle:\nComparative Handover Performance Analysis Of Ipv6 Mobility Management Protocols\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The blind separation technique includes two steps. The first step is to estimate a mixing matrix, and the second is to estimate sources. The mixing matrix can be estimated by using a clustering approach which is described by the generalized exponential mixture model. The generalized exponential mixture model is a powerful uniform framework to learn the mixing matrix for sparse sources. After the mixing matrix is estimated, the sources can be obtained by solving a linear programming problem. The techniques we present here can be extended to the blind separation of more sources than mixtures with a Gaussian noise.\nTitle:\nA Clustering Approach for Blind Source Separation with More Sources than Mixtures\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this article, the authors discuss these issues and propose a solution for each of them. As such, they present a new simulation methodology for designing high-performance microprocessors by combining several recently proposed techniques, such as statistical simulation, representative workload design, trace sampling, and reduced input sets. The major contribution of this study is to present a holistic view on speeding up the architectural design phase in which the above-mentioned techniques are integrated in one single architectural design framework. In this methodology, the authors first identify a region of interest in the huge design space through statistical simulation. As such, the authors conclude that this methodology can reduce the total simulation time considerably. In addition to presenting this new architectural modeling and simulation approach, a survey of related work of this fast-growing research field is presented.\nTitle:\nSpeeding Up Architectural Simulations for High-Performance Processors\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

With limited power supply, it is a challenging issue to support video applications with high resolution due to the complex functionality and high resource requirements. Thus, power-efficient design is important in computation intensive applications especially for mobile video terminals. Previous works on power-efficient control in video encoding systems focus on the low complexity design while typically ignoring the impact of scalable design by considering various power consumption involved in the encoding process. This paper is dedicated to developing a power-scalable video encoding (PSVE) strategy for energy-limited mobile terminals. PSVE can help the video encoding terminal to adjust its power consumption budget efficiently so as to enhance the power-scalable capability in mobile video terminals. This paper first establishes game theoretical analysis to model the power consumption problem as a bargaining problem. Then, the tradeoff between encoding effect and power consumption achieved by the use of game theory. The scalable and low power video encoding system based on Nash equilibrium solution is derived through the analysis on the power consumption and encoding effect. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.\nTitle:\nPower-efficient video encoding on resource-limited systems: A game-theoretic approach\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In order to reduce the per-bit energy consumption of such devices, the Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) standard was approved as IEEE 802.3az in 2010 with the aim of making Ethernet devices more energy efficient. However, the potential for energy savings, and their dependence on traffic characteristics, is poorly understood. This paper undertakes a comprehensive study of the energy efficiency of EEE, and makes three new contributions: first, we perform extensive measurements on three commercial EEE switches, and show how their power consumption profile depends on factors such as port counts, traffic loads, packet sizes, and traffic burstiness. Second, we develop a simple yet powerful model that gives analytical estimates of the power consumption of EEE switches under various traffic conditions. Third, we validate the energy savings via experiments in typical deployment scenarios, and estimate the overall reduction in annual energy costs that can be realized with widespread adoption of EEE in the Internet.\nTitle:\nAn experimental power profile of Energy Efficient Ethernet switches\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Their large numbers of objectives pose challenges to multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in terms of convergence, diversity, and complexity. Most existing MOEAs can only perform well in one of those three aspects. In view of this, we aim to design a more balanced MOEA on ManyOPs in all three aspects at the same time. Among the existing MOEAs, the two-archive algorithm (Two_Arch) is a low-complexity algorithm with two archives focusing on convergence and diversity separately. Inspired by the idea of Two_Arch, we propose a significantly improved two-archive algorithm (i.e., Two_Arch2) for ManyOPs in this paper. In our Two_Arch2, we assign different selection principles (indicator-based and Pareto-based) to the two archives. In addition, we design a new Lp-norm-based (p <; 1) diversity maintenance scheme for ManyOPs in Two_Arch2. In order to evaluate the performance of Two_Arch2 on ManyOPs, we have compared it with several MOEAs on a wide range of benchmark problems with different numbers of objectives. The experimental results show that Two_Arch2 can cope with ManyOPs (up to 20 objectives) with satisfactory convergence, diversity, and complexity.\nTitle:\nTwo&#x005F;Arch2: An Improved Two-Archive Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

As has already been observed in the literature, the answers to continuous NN-queries in spatio-temporal settings are time parameterized in the sense that the objects in the answer vary over time. Incorporating uncertainty in the model yields additional attributes that affect the semantics of the answer to this type of queries. In this work, we formalize the impact of uncertainty on the answers to the continuous probabilistic NN-queries, provide a compact structure for their representation and efficient algorithms for constructing that structure. We also identify syntactic constructs for several qualitative variants of continuous probabilistic NN-queries for uncertain trajectories and present efficient algorithms for their processing.\nTitle:\nContinuous probabilistic nearest-neighbor queries for uncertain trajectories\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We formulate this problem as learning weakly supervised classifiers for a set of independent spatio-temporal segments. The object seeds obtained using segment-level classifiers are further refined using graphcuts to generate high-precision object masks. Our results, obtained by training on a dataset of 20,000 YouTube videos weakly tagged into 15 classes, demonstrate automatic extraction of pixel-level object masks.

In such networks, topological connectivity is subject to frequent, unpredictable change. Our work focuses on networks with high rate of such changes to connectivity. For such dynamically changing networks we propose protocols which exploit the co-ordinated (by the protocol) motion of a small part of the network. We show that such protocols can be designed to work correctly and efficiently even in the case of arbitrary (but not malicious) movements of the hosts not affected by the protocol. We also propose a methodology for the analysis of the expected behavior of protocols for such networks, based on the assumption that mobile hosts (those whose motion is not guided by the protocol) conduct concurrent random walks in their motion space. In particular, our work examines the fundamental problem of communication and proposes distributed algorithms for it. We provide rigorous proofs of their correctness, and also give performance analyses by combinatorial tools. Finally, we have evaluated these protocols by experimental means.\nTitle:\nDistributed communication algorithms for ad hoc mobile networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We formulate a joint routing and MAC (JRM) optimization problem to determine the optimal max-min throughput of the flows and the optimal configuration of routing and MAC parameters.

One of the current challenges for robots playing in the RoboCup Four-Legged League is choosing the right behaviour in any game situation. We argue that a flexible theoretical model for using case based reasoning for game plays will prove useful in robot soccer.

Based on the non-volatile spin transfer torque (STT) magnetic technology, we introduce a basic set of non-volatile reconfigurable Look-Up-Table (LUT) logic components (NV-STT-based LUTs). STT-based LUT with significantly different set of characteristics compared to CMOS provides new opportunities to enhance design security yet makes it challenging to remain highly competitive with custom CMOS or even SRAM-based LUT in terms of power, performance and area. To address these challenges, we propose several algorithms to select and replace custom CMOS gates with reconfigurable STT-based LUTs during design implementation such that the functionality of STT-based components and therefore the entire design cannot be determined in any manageable time, rendering any design reverse engineering attack ineffective. Our study conducted on a large number of standard circuit benchmarks concludes significant resiliency of hybrid STT-CMOS circuits against various types of attacks. Furthermore, the selection algorithms on average have a small impact of less than 3%, 8%, and 3% on design parametric constraints including performance, power and area, respectively.\nTitle:\nHybrid STT-CMOS designs for reverse-engineering prevention.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

One crucial issue in BoW approaches is the size of vocabulary. BoW descriptors under a small vocabulary can be both robust and efficient, while keeping high recall rate compared with large vocabulary. However, the high false positives exists in small vocabulary also limits its application. To address this problem in small vocabulary, we propose a novel matching algorithm based on salient visual words selection. More specifically, the variation of visual words across a given video are represented as trajectories and those containing locally asymptotically stable points are selected as salient visual words. Then we attempt to measure the similarity of two videos through saliency matching merely based on the selected salient visual words to remove false positives. Our experiments show that a small codebook with saliency matching is quite competitive in video copy detection. With the incorporation of the proposed saliency matching, the precision can be improved by 30% on average compared with the state-of-the-art technique. Moreover, our proposed method is capable of detecting severe transformations, e.g. picture in picture and post production.\nTitle:\nSmall Vocabulary with Saliency Matching for Video Copy Detection.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Conversations provide a promising model for specifying and analyzing the interactions among the peers participating to a composite Web service. In this article, we discuss the following question: What is the impact of asynchronous communication on the conversation behavior? We show that the conversation behavior is significantly different for synchronous and asynchronous communication even if the local behaviors of the peers remain the same. We discuss two techniques for analyzing conversations: synchronizability and realizability analyses. Synchronizability analysis is used to identify bottom-up Web service specifications for which asynchronous communication does not change the conversation behavior. Realizability analysis, on the other hand, is used to identify top-down Web service specifications which are realizable using asynchronous communication. We show that using the synchronizability and realizability analyses it is possible to automatically verify conversation behavior for bottom-up and topdown Web service specifications using model checking.\nTitle:\nAnalyzing conversations of Web services\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The architecture uses constraints as a common knowledge interchange format, expressed against a common ontology. Knowledge held in local sources can be transformed into a common constraint language, and fused with knowledge from other sources. The fused knowledge is then used to solve some problem or deliver some information to a user. Problem solving in KRAFT typically exploits pre-existing constraint solvers. KRAFT uses an open and flexible agent architecture in which knowledge sources, knowledge fusing entities and users are all represented by independent KRAFT agents, communicating using a messaging protocol. Facilitator agents perform matchmaking and brokerage services between the various kinds of agent. KRAFT is being applied to an example application in the domain of network data services design.\nTitle:\nThe KRAFT architecture for knowledge fusion and transformation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

MUGI was proposed by Hitachi, Ltd. in 2002 and it is specified as ISO/IEC 18033-4 for keystream generation. Fault analysis is a side-channel attack that uses the faulty output obtained by inducing faults into secure devices. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first paper that proposes applying fault analysis to MUGI. The proposed attack uses the relation between two kinds of the update functions that are mutually dependent. As a result, our attack can recover a 128-bit secret key using 12.54 pairs of correct and faulty outputs on average within 1 sec.\nTitle:\nFault analysis on stream cipher MUGI\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In the FSA attack, fault injections are used to test out the sensitive information leakage called fault sensitivity.

We demonstrate that without using the values of the faulty outputs, attackers can obtain the information of the secret key based on the data-dependency of the collected fault sensitivity data.

Accordingly, energy-saving methods must consider those QoS parameters. In this paper, we survey the most recent work on energy efficiency in WSNs and we discuss the impacts of these methods on the QoS provided. Moreover, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer procedure to deal with the trade-off between energy consumption and other QoS parameters. The idea is to tackle a certain source of energy consumption to minimize the drawn energy. Subsequently, this energy-saving method is refined to consider other service qualities. To support the correctness of our claim, three energy-saving methods, taking the QoS issues into consideration, are given as examples. The first method exploits a so-called Fuzzy transform for shrinking the wireless traffic with highly precise lossy data compression. In the second method, the sensing module is targeted by employing reliable virtual sensors. Such sensors compensate the unavailability of main energy-hungry sensors during sleep periods. The third method exploits a self-adaptive mechanism to improve the QoS parameters via deliberately reducing the lifetime below the maximum time and exploiting design-time knowledge.\nTitle:\nImproving Energy Efficiency In Qos-Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The present paper proposes a novel approach to using continuously streaming moving object trajectories for traffic prediction and management. The approach continuously performs three functions for streams of moving object positions in road networks: 1) management of current evolving trajectories, 2) incremental mining of closed frequent routes, and 3) prediction of near-future locations and densities based on 1) and 2). The approach is empirically evaluated on a large real-world data set of moving object trajectories, originating from a fleet of taxis, illustrating that detailed closed frequent routes can be efficiently discovered and used for prediction.\nTitle:\nFrequent route based continuous moving object location- and density prediction on road networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It proposes a compositional approach which derives symmetries of the applications from primitive constraints. The key insight is the recognition of the special role of global constraints in symmetry detection. Once the symmetries of global constraints are available, it often becomes much easier to derive symmetries compositionally and efficiently. The paper demonstrates the potential of this approach by studying several classes of value and variable symmetries and applying the resulting techniques to two non-trivial applications.

On the other hand, the paradigm in which many applications are developed is object-oriented, and traditional object referencing abstractions typically lack the beneficial loose coupling properties of aforementioned paradigms.

By definition, it is negatively related to knowledge in that knowledge is lost, be it deliberately or not, and therefore, forgetting has not received as much attention in the field of knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) as other processes with a more positive orientation, like query answering, inference, or update. However, from a cognitive view, forgetting also has an ordering function in the human mind, suppressing information that is deemed irrelevant and improving cognitive capabilities to focus and deal only with relevant aspects of the problem under consideration. In this regard, forgetting is a crucial part of reasoning. This paper collects and surveys approaches to forgetting in the field of knowledge representation and reasoning, highlighting their roles in diverse tasks of knowledge processing, and elaborating on common techniques. We recall forgetting operations for propositional and predicate logic, as well as for answer set programming (as an important representative of nonmonotonic logics) and modal logics. We discuss forgetting in the context of (ir)relevance and (in)dependence, and explicit the role of forgetting for specific tasks of knowledge representation, showing its positive impact on solving KRR problems.\nTitle:\nA Brief Survey on Forgetting from a Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Perspective.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

While there are recent works for non-uniform motion deblurring [Whyte et al. 2010; Joshi et al. 2010], those approaches either limit the freedom of camera motions or require special hardware. Our method is based on a novel representation of motion blurs, which models the blur effects using a set of homographies [Tai et al. to appear]. This representation can fully describe the motions of camera shakes in 3D world, which cause non-uniform motion blurs. Our main contribution is the blind motion deblurring algorithm associated with this representation. We solve the ill-posed non-uniform point spread function (PSF) estimation problem by transforming it into a well-posed image registration problem that estimates homographies. To improve the robustness of our method, we use two input images for deblurring. Our method is experimented with both synthetic and real world examples, and produces superior deblurring results compared to previous methods.\nTitle:\nNon-uniform motion deblurring for camera shakes using image registration\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We first introduce a real-time principal direction estimation algorithm to determine the line stroke directions on dynamic opaque objects using neighboring normal ray triplets. To render reflections or refractions in a line-art style, we develop a stroke direction propagation algorithm by using multi-perspective projections to propagate the stroke directions from the nearby opaque objects onto specular surfaces. Finally, we present an image-space stroke mapping method to draw line strokes using the computed or propagated stroke directions.

These requirements are typically expressed as an optimization problem over quality attributes of interest, whose value is determined by the executions of the system. Identifying the optimal variant can be hard due to the state-explosion problem inherent to model checking the exponentially growing number of variants in large VIS. In this paper, we lay the foundations for the application of smart sampling and statistical model checking to solve this problem faster. We design a simple method that samples variants and executions in a uniform manner from a featured weighted automaton and that assesses which of the sampled variants/executions are optimal. We implemented our approach on top of ProVeLines, a tool suite for model-checking VIS and carried out a preliminary evaluation on an industrial embedded system design case study. Our results show that sampling-based approaches indeed holds the potential to improve scalability but should be supported by better heuristics to be competitive.\n\n\nTitle:\nTowards sampling and simulation-based analysis of featured weighted automata\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this case, collections of information granules are obviously constructed through clustering techniques. However, clustering problems are intractable and NP-complete problems with a number of patterns, In this article, we discuss the use of DNA computing as a vehicle of heterogeneous coordinated data clustering, and elaborate on the fundamentals of DNA computing in the context of clustering tasks. A novel DNA-based clustering method is proposed, using statistics-based encoding of DNA strands, for clustering coordinated data from simulated DNA studies and experiments.

Our new approach directly compresses the field of deformation gradient defined on the surface mesh, by decomposing it into rigid-body motion (rotation) and non-rigid-body deformation (stretching) through polar decomposition. It is known that the rotation group has the algebraic topology of 3D ring, which is different from other operations like stretching. Thus we compress these two groups separately, by using Manifold Harmonics Transform to drop out their high-frequency details. Our experimental result shows that the proposed method achieves a good balance between the reconstruction quality and the compression ratio. We compare our results quantitatively with other existing approaches on animation compression, using standard measurement criteria.\nTitle:\nSpectral Animation Compression.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We first define the Global Resource Sharing (GRS) problem. Then, we introduce the Global Inter Basic Block Resource Sharing (GIBBS) technique to solve the GRS problem. We developed five heuristics to solve the GRS problem. The first tries to minimize the number of connections between modules, the second considers the area gain, the third uses the criticality of operations assigned to resources as a measure for deciding on merging any given pair of resources, the fourth tries to capture common resource chains and overlap those to minimize both area and delay, and the fifth is the combination of these heuristics. While applying resource sharing, we also consider the execution frequency of the basic blocks. Using our techniques we synthesized several CDFGs representing applications from MediaBench suite. Our results show that, we can reduce the total area requirement by 44% on average (up to 59%) while increasing the execution time by 6% on average.\nTitle:\nGlobal resource sharing for synthesis of control data flow graphs on FPGAs\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This problem is equivalent to some specific type of edge colourings of complete graphs with two colours, where the number of monochromatic K-4 is minimized. We show that all the extremal colourings must contain monochromatic K-4 only in one of the two colours.

In [1], we introduced a new formalism, in which each transition is associated with a bipartite partially ordered set made of concurrent inputs followed by concurrent outputs. In this paper, we generalize this model to Partial Order Input/Output Automata (POIOA), in which each transition is associated with an almost arbitrary partially ordered set of inputs and outputs. This formalism can be seen as High-Level Messages Sequence Charts with inputs and outputs and allows for the specification of concurrency between inputs and outputs in a very general, direct and concise way. We give a formal definition of this framework, and define several conformance relations for comparing system specifications expressed in this formalism. Then we show how to derive a test suite that guarantees to detect faults defined by a POIOA-specific fault model: missing output faults, unspecified output faults, weaker precondition faults, stronger precondition faults and transfer faults.\nTitle:\nTesting Systems Specified as Partial Order Input/Output Automata\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Freund and Schapire [6] have shown how a different function of the margin distribution can be used to bound the number of mistakes of an on-line learning algorithm for a perceptron, as well as an expected error bound. We show that a slight generalization of their construction can be used to give a pac style bound on the tail of the distribution of the generalization errors that arise from a given sample size. We also derive an algorithm for optimizing the new measure for general kernel based learning machines.

This \"paperless\" government facilitates the transparency of government and fosters collaboration across government agencies and among citizens. The citizen services often require sharing citizen data and documents among many different collaborating government agencies, which may contain sensitive information of citizens. In this environment, the security and privacy issues become a paramount priority to build a trust-worthy and sustainable smart government. Even though the existing PKI systems can provide secure exchange of information between two organizations, preventing illegal modification, edits, or transfers of sensitive data to a third parties for unintended purposes is essential at the end user side. In this paper, we present a security and trusted framework for secure Government Data Sharing (SecureGov), implemented in the Public Information Sharing Center (PISC) under the Ministry of Public Administration and Security in Korea. The layered security framework uses combined technologies, including usage control scheme called Enterprise Digital Right Management (E-DRM) to prevent illegal use and leakage, a forgery prevention technology using a 2-D barcode to prevent illegal modification of the data, and PKI scheme to ensure the authenticity of the data.\nTitle:\nSecureGov: secure data sharing for government services\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

A list L(2,1)-labeling of G is an assignment of a label in C(v) to each vertex v of G such that every two adjacent vertices receive labels which differ by at least 2 and every two vertices of distance two receive labels which differ by at least 1. In this paper, we study the problem of reconfiguring one list L(2,1)-labeling of a graph into another list L(2,1)-labeling of the same graph by changing only one label assignment at a time, while at all times maintaining a list L(2,1)-labeling. First we show that this decision problem is PSPACE-complete, even for bipartite planar graphs and k=6. In contrast, we then show that the problem can be solved in linear time for general graphs if k@?4. We finally consider the problem restricted to trees, and give a sufficient condition for which any two list L(2,1)-labelings of a tree can be transformed into each other.\nTitle:\nReconfiguration of list L (2,1)-labelings in a graph\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Temperature affects reliability, performance and power directly, motivating the need to accurately simulate the thermal profile of a chip. In literature, thermal conductivity is assumed to be a constant in order to obtain a linear system of equations which can be solved efficiently. But thermal conductivity is a nonlinear function of temperature and for silicon it varies by 22% over the range 27.80. C [1]. If the nonlinearity of the thermal conductivity is ignored the thermal profile might be off by 10. C. Thus to get an accurate thermal profile it is important to consider the nonlinear dependence of the thermal conductivity on temperature. In this paper the nonlinear system arising out of considering the nonlinear thermal conductivity is solved efficiently using a variant of Newton-Raphson. In this paper we also study the abstraction levels under which the approximation of a periodic source by a DC source is valid.\nTitle:\nAccurate Thermal Analysis Considering Nonlinear Thermal Conductivity\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

They allow their users to label diverse resources with freely chosen keywords (tags). Our studies of two real-world folksonomies unveil that individual users develop highly personalized vocabularies of tags. While these meet individual needs and preferences, the considerable differences between personal tag vocabularies (personomies) impede services such as social search or customized tag recommendation. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-centric tag model that allows us to derive mappings between personal tag vocabularies and the corresponding folksonomies. Using these mappings, we can infer the meaning of user-assigned tags and can predict choices of tags a user may want to assign to new items. Furthermore, our translational approach helps in reducing common problems related to tag ambiguity, synonymous tags, or multilingualism. We evaluate the applicability of our method in tag recommendation and tag-based social search. Extensive experiments show that our translational model improves the prediction accuracy in both scenarios.\nTitle:\nI tag, you tag: translating tags for advanced user models\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We evaluate the scheduling algorithms that have been proposed for traditional ATM networks. Based on the structure of EC-MAC and the characteristics of wireless channel, we propose a new algorithm that can deal with the burst errors and the location-dependent errors. Most scheduling algorithms proposed for either wired or wireless networks were analyzed with homogeneous traffic or multimedia services with simplified traffic models. We analyze our scheduling algorithm with more realistic multimedia traffic models based on H.263 video traces and self-similar data traffic. One of the key goals of the scheduling algorithms is simplicity and fast implementation. Unlike the time-stamped based algorithms, our algorithm does not need to sort the virtual time, and thus, the complexity of the algorithm is reduced significantly.\nTitle:\nScheduling Multimedia Services in a Low-Power MAC for Wireless and Mobile ATM Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This mere observation justifies plainly the need to investigate alternative ways for verification. In this paper we present such an alternative which uses a compositional verification rule. The basic idea is to automatically compute local properties and combine them such that together they are strong enough to prove global safety properties of systems. In [2] we showed how such a rule works in the framework of timed systems with a fixed number of components and in [3] how the whole approach can be extended to the parameterised case. The application of the compositional verification rule can be pushed even further with respect to two directions: 1 hybrid and 2 parametric systems.

Differently from any other literature proposal, SCORe jointly guarantees the following properties: (i) it is genuine, thus ensuring that only the replicas that maintain data accessed by a transaction are involved in its processing, and (ii) it guarantees that read operations always access consistent snapshots, thanks to a one-copy serializable multiversion scheme, which never aborts read-only transactions and spares them from any (distributed) validation phase. This makes SCORe particularly efficient in presence of read-intensive workloads, as typical of a wide range of real-world applications. We have integrated SCORe into a popular open source distributed data grid and performed a large scale experimental study with well-known benchmarks using both private and public cloud infrastructures.

We discuss proactive approaches in which the data is scanned or sampled (periodically, at optimization time or at query time), or in which exploratory queries are executed. Also discussed are reactive approaches that monitor the results of the query processing.

Running at the application layer, overlay networks usually rely on probing mechanisms for IP-path performance monitoring and failure detection. Their service performance is jointly determined by their topology, parameters of probing mechanism and failure restoration methods. In this paper, we first define metrics to evaluate the performance of overlay networks in terms of failure detection and recovery, network stability and overhead. Second, we model the overlay-based failure detection and recovery process. Through extensive simulations, we investigate how different IP-layer path failure characteristics and overlay topologies, detection and restoration parameters affect service performance of overlay networks. In particular, we examine the tradeoffs among different overlay performance metrics and the optimal performance conditions. Our study helps to understand overlay-based failure recovery and provides practical guidance to overlay network designers and administrators.\nTitle:\nOn the analysis of overlay failure detection and recovery\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The actual challenge of synchronizing the playout of each participant to a reference playout time is a tough task in terms of Quality of Experience (QoE). A possible solution for carrying out the synchronization is Adaptive Media Playout (AMP) where the playout speed of the multimedia is increased or decreased. In this paper we evaluate the impact of the playout variations on the QoE by adopting a crowdsourcing approach. In particular, we investigate the impact of randomly selecting content sections for adapting the playout rate compared to our approach that exploits audio-visual features of the content in order to minimize the impact on the QoE.\nTitle:\nA subjective evaluation using crowdsourcing of Adaptive Media Playout utilizing audio-visual content features\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

On the contrary, there is a wide range of models, methods, techniques, and tools which are selected according to the specific task, the application domain, the professional experience, and the organizational culture. We argue that different approaches and technologies may be combined into a unique platform to satisfy the needs of software systems which evolve over long periods of time.This paper presents the Integrated Environment for Software Evolution Management (IESEM) which includes software repositories, reverse engineering tools, rationale capture tools, software measurement tools, and a user-friendly interface. It can manage heterogeneous systems characterized by various design methods and programming languages. IESEM is based on a central repository which stores software engineering artifacts, program code, design, and implementation decisions in the form of a traceability graph. The repository stores also software measures computed both from programs and external CASE repositories. Measures are used to control software degradation during its evolution and to support decisions based on quality factors.The key concepts of IESEM, its design, and implementation are presented. The use of IESEM during development and maintenance is discussed. A case study shows IESEM's effectiveness in performing maintenance tasks.\nTitle:\nIesem - Integrated Environment For Software Evolution Management\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Existing algorithms for this operation focus almost exclusively on path-patterns or tree-patterns. Requirements in flexible querying of XML data have motivated recently the introduction of query languages that allow a partial specification of path-patterns in a query. In this paper, we focus on the efficient evaluation of partial path queries, a generalization of path pattern queries. Our approach explicitly deals with repeated labels (that is, multiple occurrences of the same label in a query). We show that partial path queries can be represented as rooted dags for which a topological ordering of the nodes exists. We present three algorithms for the efficient evaluation of these queries under the indexed streaming evaluation model. The first one exploits a structural summary of data to generate a set of path-patterns that together are equivalent to a partial path query. To evaluate these path-patterns, we extend PathStack so that it can work on path-patterns with repeated labels. The second one extracts a spanning tree from the query dag, uses a stack-based algorithm to find the matches of the root-to-leaf paths in the tree, and merge-joins the matches to compute the answer. Finally, the third one exploits multiple pointers of stack entries and a topological ordering of the query dag to apply a stack-based holistic technique. An analysis of the algorithms and extensive experimental evaluation shows that the holistic algorithm outperforms the other ones.\nTitle:\nEfficient evaluation of generalized path pattern queries on XML data\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The diversity of algorithms that has resulted from efforts to improve rate adaptation has introduced a new dimension of variability into 802.11 wireless networks, further complicating the already difficult task of understanding and debugging 802.11 performance. To assist with this task, in this paper we present and evaluate a methodology for accurately fingerprinting 802.11 rate adaptation algorithms. Our approach uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classifier that requires only simple passive measurements of 802.11 traffic. We demonstrate that careful conversion of raw packet traces into input features for SVM is necessary for achieving high classification accuracy. We tested our classifier on the four rate adaptation algorithms available in MadWifi, the most popular open source driver for commodity wireless cards. The classifier performs with an accuracy of 95%-100%. We also show that the classifier is robust over a variety of network conditions if the training data includes a sufficient sampling of the range of an algorithm's behavior.\nTitle:\nFingerprinting 802.11 Rate Adaptation Algorithms\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Their joint effects give rise to the variation in responses to the same question by different crowd-workers. This variation is low when the question is easy to answer and objective, and high when it is difficult and subjective. Unfortunately, current quality control methods for crowdsourcing consider only the question difficulty to account for the variation. As a result,these methods cannot distinguish workers personal preferences for different correct answers of a partially subjective question from their ability/expertise to avoid objectively wrong answers for that question. To address this issue, we present a probabilistic model which (i) explicitly encodes question difficulty as a model parameter and (ii) implicitly encodes question subjectivity via latent preference factors for crowd-workers. We show that question subjectivity induces grouping of crowd-workers, revealed through clustering of their latent preferences. Moreover, we develop a quantitative measure of the subjectivity of a question. Experiments show that our model(1) improves the performance of both quality control for crowd-sourced answers and next answer prediction for crowd-workers,and (2) can potentially provide coherent rankings of questions in terms of their difficulty and subjectivity, so that task providers can refine their designs of the crowdsourcing tasks, e.g. by removing highly subjective questions or inappropriately difficult questions.\nTitle:\nDistinguishing Question Subjectivity from Difficulty for Improved Crowdsourcing.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Also, straight-line RAC drawings always exist for IC-planar graphs [9], a subclass of 1-planar graphs.

Due to the scale of today's data enters, the failure of computing resources is a common occurrence that may disrupt the availability of ICT services, leading to revenue loss. Although many high availability (HA) techniques have been proposed to mask resource failures, datacenter users' -- who rent datacenter resources and use them to provide ICT utilities to a global population' -- still have limited management options for dynamically selecting and configuring HA techniques. In this work, we propose Availability-on-Demand (AoD), a mechanism consisting of an API that allows datacenter users to specify availability requirements which can dynamically change, and an availability-aware scheduler that dynamically manages computing resources based on user-specified requirements. The mechanism operates at the level of individual service instance, thus enabling fine-grained control of availability, for example during sudden requirement changes and periodic operations. Through realistic, trace-based simulations, we show that the AoD mechanism can achieve high availability with low cost. The AoD approach consumes about the same CPU hours but with higher availability than approaches which use HA techniques randomly. Moreover, comparing to an ideal approach which has perfect predictions about failures, it consumes 13% to 31% more CPU hours but achieves similar availability for critical parts of applications.\nTitle:\nAn Availability-on-Demand Mechanism for Datacenters\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

With the objective to integrate the two, this article proposes a translation of a timing-sensitive security property for simple multi-threaded programs into a more general security framework. Interestingly, our notion of security for programs is bisimulation-based while the security framework is trace-based.

Traditionally, to provide reliability, lost packets from different flows (applications) are retransmitted separately, leading to inefficient use of wireless bandwidth. Using the proposed hybrid network coding approach, the BS encodes these lost packets, possibly from different flows together before broadcasting them to all wireless users. In this way, multiple wireless receivers can recover their lost packets simultaneously with a single transmission from the BS. Furthermore, simulations and theoretical analysis showed that when used in conjunction with an appropriate channel coding technique under typical channel conditions, this approach can increase the throughput efficiency up to 3.5 times over the Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), and up to 1.5 times over the HARQ techniques.\nTitle:\nA hybrid network coding technique for single-hop wireless networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Salient features are generally determined from the local differential structure of images. They focus on the shape-saliency of the local neighborhood. The majority of these detectors are luminance-based, which has the disadvantage that the distinctiveness of the local color information is completely ignored in determining salient image features. To fully exploit the possibilities of salient point detection in color images, color distinctiveness should be taken into account in addition to shape distinctiveness. In this paper, color distinctiveness is explicitly incorporated into the design of saliency detection. The algorithm, called color saliency boosting, is based on an analysis of the statistics of color image derivatives. Color saliency boosting is designed as a generic method easily adaptable to existing feature detectors. Results show that substantial improvements in information content are acquired by targeting color salient features.\nTitle:\nBoosting Color Saliency in Image Feature Detection\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We present a unified topic model to simultaneously model topical aspects of different objects in the academic network. Based on the learned topic models, we investigate the expertise search problem from three dimensions: ranking, citation tracing analysis, and topical graph search. Specifically, we propose a topic level random walk method for ranking the different objects. In citation tracing analysis, we aim to uncover how a piece of work influences its follow-up work. Finally, we have developed a topical graph search function, based on the topic modeling and citation tracing analysis.

These communities are inherent characteristics of human interaction in online social networks, as well as paper citation networks. Also, communities may evolve over time, due to changes to individuals' roles and social status in the network as well as changes to individuals' research interests. We present an innovative algorithm that deviates from the traditional two-step approach to analyze community evolutions. In the traditional approach, communities are first detected for each time slice, and then compared to determine correspondences. We argue that this approach is inappropriate in applications with noisy data. In this paper, we propose FacetNet for analyzing communities and their evolutions through a robust unified process. This novel framework will discover communities and capture their evolution with temporal smoothness given by historic community structures. Our approach relies on formulating the problem in terms of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, where the community structure is estimated both by the observed networked data and by the prior distribution given by historic community structures. Then we develop an iterative algorithm, with proven low time complexity, which is guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution. We perform extensive experimental studies, on both synthetic datasets and real datasets, to demonstrate that our method discovers meaningful communities and provides additional insights not directly obtainable from traditional methods.\nTitle:\nAnalyzing communities and their evolutions in dynamic social networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Beside textual features, the hierarchical structure of directories reflect additional and important knowledge annotated by experts. It is generally desired to incorporate this information into text mining processes. In this paper, we propose hierarchy-regularized latent semantic indexing, which encodes the hierarchy into a similarity graph of documents and then formulates an optimization problem mapping each document into a low dimensional vector space. The new feature space preserves the intrinsic structure of the original taxonomy and thus provides a meaningful basis for various learning tasks like visualization and classification. Our approach employs the information about class proximity and class specificity, and can naturally cope with multi-labeled documents. Our empirical studies show very encouraging results on two real-world data sets, the new Reuters (RCV1) benchmark and the Swissprot protein database.\nTitle:\nHierarchy-Regularized Latent Semantic Indexing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this work, we investigate the design of on-chip interconnection networks for clustered microarchitectures. This new class of interconnects has different demands and characteristics than traditional multiprocessor networks. In a clustered microarchitecture, a low inter-cluster communication latency is essential for high performance. We propose point-to-point interconnects together with an effective latency-aware instruction steering scheme and show that they achieve much better performance than bus-based interconnects. The results show that the connectivity of the network together with latency-aware steering schemes are key for high performance. We also show that these interconnects can be built with simple hardware and achieve a performance close to that of an idealized contention-free model.\nTitle:\nEfficient interconnects for clustered microarchitectures\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In general, the size of such buffers is not known apriori, i.e., they are considered to be unbounded. As a result, models of asynchronously communicating systems typically exhibit infinite state spaces and it is well-known that reachability and boundedness problems for such models are undecidable. This, in turn, makes automatic verification of asynchronous systems undecidable as well. We discuss a particular class of asynchronous systems over peers for which the interaction behaviors do not change when the peers are made to communicate synchronously. Such systems are referred to as Synchronizable. Automatic verification of synchronizable systems is decidable as the verification of the system can be performed using its synchronous counterpart. Recently, we have proved that checking whether or not a system is synchronizable is decidable. In this paper, we consider different types of asynchronous communication, where the type is described in terms of the nature of buffering and the number of buffers, and discuss how/if synchronizability is decidable for each type. The new results subsume the existing ones and present a comprehensive synchronizability study of asynchronous systems.\nTitle:\nOn deciding synchronizability for asynchronously communicating systems.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This raises severe questions concerning the security and privacy of the data on the external storage. In this paper we consider a scenario where multiple clients want to share data on a server, while hiding all access patterns. We propose here a first solution to this problem based on Oblivious RAM (ORAM) techniques. Data owners can delegate rights to external new clients enabling them to privately access portions of the outsourced data served by a curious server. Our solution is as efficient as the underlying ORAM constructs and allows for delegated read or write access while ensuring strong guarantees for the privacy of the outsourced data. The server does not learn anything about client access patterns while clients do not learn anything more than what their delegated rights permit.\nTitle:\nOblivious outsourced storage with delegation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

These two goals are not easy to reconcile, especially if one also aims at high assurances for correctness. In this paper, we describe a combination of Isabelle/HOL with a proof-producing SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver that contains a SAT engine and a decision procedure for quantifier-free first-order logic with equality. As a result, a user benefits from the expressiveness of Isabelle/HOL when modeling a system, but obtains much better automation for those fragments of the proofs that fall within the scope of the (automatic) SMT solver. Soundness is not compromised because all proofs are submitted to the trusted kernel of Isabelle for certification.

In this paper, we present MobiFeed that is a framework designed for scheduling news feeds for mobile users. MobiFeed consists of three key functions, location prediction, relevance measure, and news feed scheduler. The location prediction function is designed to estimate a mobile user's locations based on a path prediction algorithm. The relevance measure function is implemented by combining the vector space model with non-spatial and spatial factors to determine the relevance of a message to a user. The news feed scheduler works with the other two functions to generate news feeds for a mobile user at her current and predicted locations with the best overall quality. We propose a heuristic algorithm as well as an optimal algorithm for the location-aware news feed scheduler. The performance of MobiFeed is evaluated through extensive experiments using a real road map and a real social network data set. The scalability of MobiFeed is also investigated using a synthetic data set. Experimental results show that MobiFeed obtains a relevance score two times higher than the state-of-the-art approach, and it can scale up to a large number of geo-tagged messages.\nTitle:\nMobiFeed: A location-aware news feed framework for moving users\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Due to the limited transmission capacity of sensor nodes, a single path often cannot meet the requirement of video transmission. Consequently, multi-path transmission is needed. However, not every path found by multi-path routing algorithms may be suitable for transmitting video, because a long routing path with a long end to end transmission delay may not satisfy the time constraint of the video. Furthermore, each video stream includes two kinds of information: image and audio streams. In different applications, image and audio streams play different roles, and the importance levels are different. Higher priority should be given to the more important stream (either the image stream or the audio stream) to guarantee the using of limited bandwidth and energy in WMSNs. In this paper, we propose a Multi-priority Multi-path Selection (MPMPS) scheme in transport layer to choose the maximum number of paths from all found node-disjoint routing paths for maximizing the throughput of streaming data transmission. Simulation results show that MPMPS can effectively choose the maximum number of paths for video transmission.\nTitle:\nMulti-priority Multi-path Selection for Video Streaming in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Proving an SLA violation is considered to be a complex operation to the cloud consumer. This task gets more and more difficult to the consumers as they use services from multiple providers, each with its own monitoring policies. In order to implicitly help the consumer monitor the SLA and detect violations, it is necessary to implement some advanced SLA management strategies. Ontological representation and reasoning techniques in SLA management may be beneficial to the evaluation of the QoS. In this regard, we propose a monitoring approach with a new semantic SLA modeling for cloud computing. Our approach aims to help cloud consumers monitor the SLA documents and detect violations by considering the semantic meaning of SLA concepts and taking profit from the power of reasoning techniques. This maintains a reliable QoS and respects the SLA parameters. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in this paper through a simulation and a case study.\nTitle:\nCloud SLA Modeling and Monitoring\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Sequential rules are potentially useful for analyzing data in sequential format, ranging from purchase histories, network logs and program execution traces. In this work, we investigate and propose a syntactic characterization of a non-redundant set of sequential rules built upon past work on compact set of representative patterns. A rule is redundant if it can be inferred from another rule having the same support and confidence. When using the set of mined rules as a composite filter, replacing a full set of rules with a non-redundant subset of the rules does not impact the accuracy of the filter. We consider several rule sets based on composition of various types of pattern sets-generators, projected-database generators, closed patterns and projected-database closed patterns. We investigate the completeness and tightness of these rule sets. We characterize a tight and complete set of non-redundant rules by defining it based on the composition of two pattern sets. Furthermore, we propose a compressed set of non-redundant rules in a spirit similar to how closed patterns serve as a compressed representation of a full set of patterns. Lastly, we propose an algorithm to mine this compressed set of non-redundant rules. A performance study shows that the proposed algorithm significantly improves both the runtime and compactness of mined rules over mining a full set of sequential rules.\nTitle:\nNon-redundant sequential rules-Theory and algorithm\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We introduce a component-level parallelism for which the number of processors in use depends on the geometry of the solution set of the input system. Our long term goal is to achieve an efficient multi-level parallelism: coarse grained (component) level for tasks computing geometric objects in the solution sets, and medium/fine grained level for polynomial arithmetic such as GCD/resultant computation within each task. Component-level parallelization of triangular decompositions belongs to the class of dynamic irregular parallel applications, which leads us to address the following question: How to exploit geometrical information at an early stage of the solving process that would be favorable to parallelization? We report on the effectiveness of the approaches that we have applied, including \"modular methods\", \"solving by decreasing order of dimension\", \"task pool with dimension and rank guided scheduling\". We have extended the Aldor programming language to support multiprocessed parallelism on SMPs and realized a preliminary implementation. Our experimentation shows promising speedups for some well-known problems and proves that our component-level parallelization is practically efficient. We expect that this speedup would add a multiplicative factor to the speedup of medium/fine grained level parallelization as parallel GCD and resultant computations.\nTitle:\nComponent-level parallelization of triangular decompositions\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Although many of these works show up to an order of magnitude performance improvement, discrete GPUs are not commonly used in modern database systems. However, there is now a proliferation of integrated GPUs which are on the same silicon die as the conventional CPU. With the advent of new programming models like heterogeneous system architecture, these integrated GPUs are considered first-class compute units, with transparent access to CPU virtual addresses and very low overhead for computation offloading. We show that integrated GPUs significantly reduce the overheads of using GPUs in a database environment. Specifically, an integrated GPU is 3x faster than a discrete GPU even though the discrete GPU has 4x the computational capability. Therefore, we develop high performance scan and aggregate algorithms for the integrated GPU. We show that the integrated GPU can outperform a four-core CPU with SIMD extensions by an average of 30% (up to 3:2x) and provides an average of 45% reduction in energy on 16 TPC-H queries.\nTitle:\nToward GPUs being mainstream in analytic processing: An initial argument using simple scan-aggregate queries\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The burden of incorporating NFRs into a system's architecture, as well the determination of new design-level NFRs, can be greatly eased by the use of a structured approach providing guidance to developers. Such structured approaches, however, require equally structured system characterisations. This is especially important for distributed systems, which are inherently complex and multi-faceted. In this paper we propose a form of characterisation which we term architectural decomposition, and present a multi-level conceptual framework for decomposing distributed software architectures. Using the framework for decomposing architectures can help guide the incorporation and, via complementary analysis processes, the determination of NFRs at the architectural level. We describe each of the levels of the framework in turn, propose a complementary analysis process for security based on threat modelling, as well as a process for using the framework itself, and demonstrate the utility of our approach via an example derived from a real-life distributed architecture.\nTitle:\nDecomposing Distributed Software Architectures for the Determination and Incorporation of Security and Other Non-functional Requirements\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Reverse engineering tools often define their own metamodels according to the intended purposes and features. Although each metamodel has its own advantages, its limitations may be addressed by other metamodels. Existing works have evaluated and compared metamodels and tools, but none have considered all the possible characteristics and limitations to provide a comprehensive guideline for classifying, comparing, reusing, and extending program metamodels. To aid practitioners and researchers in classifying, comparing, reusing, and extending program metamodels and their corresponding reverse engineering tools according to the intended goals, we establish a conceptual framework with definitions of program metamodels and related concepts. Then this framework is used to provide a comprehensive taxonomy, named Program Metamodel TAxonomy (ProMeTA), which incorporates newly identified characteristics into those stated in previous works, which were identified via a systematic literature survey on program metamodels, while keeping the orthogonality of the entire taxonomy. Additionally, we validate the taxonomy in terms of its orthogonality and usefulness through the classification of popular metamodels.\nTitle:\nA Taxonomy for Program Metamodels in Program Reverse Engineering\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The proposed framework is intended to be used for the design and evaluation of internal controls by organisations and their auditors. One component of the framework is a modelling language and the other is a process to establish internal controls. The proposed modelling language is based on Secure Tropos modelling language. It extends Secure Tropos in several ways in order to conceptualize some aspects of internal controls in which organisational structure and relationships between major stakeholders are taken into account.

Many sensors will be equipped in buildings and provide data about the context of buildings in the future. We can provide many kinds of services that use various context information acquired from wireless sensor networks. However, sensing programs may not be able to be executed concurrently on the same sensor node because of sensors' resource restrictions. So, sensing programs sometimes have to relocate to other sensors if necessary. In this paper, we suggest a middleware for the relocation of a sensing program. Considering severe resource restrictions in a wireless sensor network, we can make a sensing program with a small code footprint.\nTitle:\nA Sensor Middleware for Lightweight Relocatable Sensing Programs\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The key to better understanding the mechanisms that control this process is to identify the specific substrates that each protease targets. To address this, we have developed iProt-Sub, a powerful bioinformatics tool for the accurate prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites. Importantly, iProt-Sub represents a significantly advanced version of its successful predecessor, PROSPER. It provides optimized cleavage site prediction models with better prediction performance and coverage for more species-specific proteases (4 major protease families and 38 different proteases). iProt-Sub integrates heterogeneous sequence and structural features and uses a two-step feature selection procedure to further remove redundant and irrelevant features in an effort to improve the cleavage site prediction accuracy. Features used by iProt-Sub are encoded by 11 different sequence encoding schemes, including local amino acid sequence profile, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and native disorder, which will allow a more accurate representation of the protease specificity of approximately 38 proteases and training of the prediction models. Benchmarking experiments using cross-validation and independent tests showed that iProt-Sub is able to achieve a better performance than several existing generic tools. We anticipate that iProtSub will be a powerful tool for proteome-wide prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites, and will facilitate hypothesis-driven functional interrogation of protease-specific substrate cleavage and proteolytic events.\nTitle:\niProt-Sub: a comprehensive package for accurately mapping and predicting protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our first signature scheme is a particularly efficient version of the short exponent discrete log based scheme of Girault et al. (J. of Cryptology 2006). Our scheme has a tight reduction to the decisional Short Discrete Logarithm problem, while still maintaining the non-tight reduction to the computational version of the problem upon which the original scheme of Girault et al. is based. The second signature scheme we construct is a modification of the scheme of Lyubashevsky (Asiacrypt 2009) that is based on the worst-case hardness of the shortest vector problem in ideal lattices. And the third scheme is a very simple signature scheme that is based directly on the hardness of the Subset Sum problem. We also present a general transformation that converts, what we term lossy identification schemes, into signature schemes with tight security reductions. We believe that this greatly simplifies the task of constructing and proving the security of such signature schemes.\nTitle:\nTightly-Secure signatures from lossy identification schemes\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this context, we define the term \"Cloud Workflow\" as the specification, execution and provenance tracking of large-scale scientific workflows, as well as the management of data and computing resources to support the execution of large-scale scientific workflows in the Cloud. In this paper, we first analyze the gap between these two complementary technologies, and what it means to bring Clouds and workflows together. Then, we present the key challenges in supporting Cloud workflows, and present our reference framework for scientific workflow management in the Cloud. Last we present our experience in integrating a scientific workflow management system-Swift into the Cloud. We discuss the performance of cluster provisioning within the OpenNebula Cloud platform, the Eucalyptus Cloud platform and Amazon EC2, and we demonstrate the capability and efficiency of the integration using a NASA MODIS image processing workflow and the Montage image mosaic workflow.Note to practitioners. Scientific workflow management plays a very important role for scientific computing and application coordination, while Cloud computing offers scalability and resource on-demand. We devise autonomous methods to integrate scientific workflow management systems with Cloud platforms and also provision resources for large scale workflows, which can facilitate scientists to easily manage their workflows in the Cloud, and take advantage of large scale Cloud resources. There are a few integration options and many challenges in the process, and the experience we gain will help researchers in migrating their workflow management systems and workflow applications into the Cloud. We analyze the major challenges of running scientific workflows on the Cloud.We propose a reference framework to standardize the integration.The implementation experience proves that the framework is feasible and extendible.Cluster-recycling mechanism can improve the resource provisioning efficiency.\nTitle:\nEnabling scalable scientific workflow management in the Cloud\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The management of the resulting collections of process models poses real challenges. One of these challenges concerns model retrieval where support should be provided for the formulation and efficient execution of business process model queries.

It is based on a new version of a cube tester, which uses an improved choice of dynamic variables to eliminate the previously made assumption that ten particular key bits are zero. In addition, the new attack is much faster than the previous weak-key attack, and has a simpler key recovery process. Since it is extremely difficult to mathematically analyze the expected behavior of such attacks, we implemented it on RIVYERA, which is a new massively parallel reconfigurable hardware, and tested its main components for dozens of random keys. These tests experimentally verified the correctness and expected complexity of the attack, by finding a very significant bias in our new cube tester for about 7.5% of the keys we tested. This is the first time that the main components of a complex analytical attack are successfully realized against a full-size cipher with a special-purpose machine. Moreover, it is also the first attack that truly exploits the configurable nature of an FPGA-based cryptanalytical hardware.\nTitle:\nAn experimentally verified attack on full grain-128 using dedicated reconfigurable hardware\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this talk, we will first present an overview on the FlashDB project, which was launched in 2009 and supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 60833005). The project aims at constructing the fundamental theory and design principles of flash-based database systems including a series of key problems, such as system architecture, storage management and indexing, query processing, transaction processing, buffer management, etc. In particular, we focus on establishing a basis for data management involving flash memory, developing database management systems for flash-based SSDs, and preparing a test bed for flash-based database applications. During the past two years, we have made some achievements in buffer management [1, 2], index structures [3], storage management [4], and SSD simulation platform [5].

Our approach results in order of magnitude improvements compared with bigWig and ensures compression rates only a fraction of those produced by cWig. The key features of the smallWig algorithm are statistical data analysis and a combination of source coding methods that ensure high flexibility and make the algorithm suitable for different applications. Furthermore, for general-purpose file compression, the compression rate of smallWig approaches the empirical entropy of the tested WIG data. For compression with random query features, smallWig uses a simple block-based compression scheme that introduces only a minor overhead in the compression rate. For archival or storage space-sensitive applications, the method relies on context mixing techniques that lead to further improvements of the compression rate. Implementations of smallWig can be executed in parallel on different sets of chromosomes using multiple processors, thereby enabling desirable scaling for future transcriptome Big Data platforms. Motivation: The development of next-generation sequencing technologies has led to a dramatic decrease in the cost of DNA/RNA sequencing and expression profiling. RNA-seq has emerged as an important and inexpensive technology that provides information about whole transcriptomes of various species and organisms, as well as different organs and cellular communities. The vast volume of data generated by RNA-seq experiments has significantly increased data storage costs and communication bandwidth requirements. Current compression tools for RNA-seq data such as bigWig and cWig either use general-purpose compressors (gzip) or suboptimal compression schemes that leave significant room for improvement. To substantiate this claim, we performed a statistical analysis of expression data in different transform domains and developed accompanying entropy coding methods that bridge the gap between theoretical and practical WIG file compression rates. Results: We tested different variants of the smallWig compression algorithm on a number of integer-and real-(floating point) valued RNA-seq WIG files generated by the ENCODE project. The results reveal that, on average, smallWig offers 18-fold compression rate improvements, up to 2.5-fold compression time improvements, and 1.5-fold decompression time improvements when compared with bigWig. On the tested files, thememory usage of the algorithm never exceeded 90 KB. When more elaborate context mixing compressors were used within smallWig, the obtained compression rates were as much as 23 times better than those of bigWig. For smallWig used in the random query mode, which also supports retrieval of the summary statistics, an overhead in the compression rate of roughly 3-17% was introduced depending on the chosen system parameters. An increase in encoding and decoding time of 30% and 55% represents an additional performance loss caused by enabling random data access. We also implemented smallWig using multi-processor programming. This parallelization feature decreases the encoding delay 2-3.4 times compared with that of a single-processor implementation, with the number of processors used ranging from 2 to 8; in the same parameter regime, the decoding delay decreased 2-5.2 times.\nTitle:\nsmallWig: parallel compression of RNA-seq WIG files.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

It makes use of the relationship between motion direction and edge direction of macro-blocks, and selects the optimal inter mode by measuring the dominant edge direction using the residual macro-block. Without fully decoding the compressed high resolution video, Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients were extracted and reused in transform domain to construct the residual macro-block. Based on the measurement of dominant edge direction, only a small number of inter-modes are required for Rate Distortion Optimal evaluation.

Comparisons to the following solutions (and variants) are included: `traditional'' CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists), Micali''s Certificate Revocation System (CRS) and Kocher''s Certificate Revocation Trees (CRT). We also consider a scenario in which certificates are not revoked, but frequently issued for short-term periods. Based on the authenticated dictionary scheme, a certificate update scheme is presented in which all certificates are updated by a common message. The suggested solutions for certificate revocation and certificate update problems is better than current solutions with respect to communication costs, update rate, and robustness to changes in parameters and is compatible e.g. with X.500 certificates.\nTitle:\nCertificate Revocation and Certificate Update\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In several of these applications, it is important that in addition to detecting corruption of the data we also localize the corruptions. This motivates us to introduce and investigate the new notion of corruptionlocalizing hashing, defined as a natural extension of collision-intractable hashing. Our main contribution is in formally defining corruption-localizing hash schemes and designing two such schemes, one starting from any collision-intractable hash function, and the other starting from any collision-intractable keyed hash function. Both schemes have attractive efficiency properties in three important metrics: localization factor, tag length and localization running time, capturing the quality of localization, and performance in terms of storage and time complexity, respectively. The closest previous results, when modified to satisfy our formal definitions, only achieve similar properties in the case of a single corruption.\nTitle:\nCorruption-localizing hashing\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Because of prohibitive monetary and energy cost of currently over-engineered communication hardware, dense deployments of shallow water sensor networks remain an elusive goal. To enable dense shallow water networks, we propose a network architecture that builds on the success of terrestrial sensor motes and that relies on the coupling of software modems and widely available speakers and microphones in sensor motes to establish acoustic communication links. In this paper, we analytically and empirically explore the potential of this acoustic communication system for the underwater environment. Our experimental approach first profiles the hardware in water after waterproofing the components with elastic membranes. The medium profiling results expose the favorable frequencies of operation for the hardware, enabling us to design a software FSK modem. Subsequently, our experiments evaluate the data transfer capability of the underwater channel with 8-frequency FSK software modems. The experiments within a 17x8m controlled underwater environment yield an error-free channel capacity of 24bps, and they also demonstrate that the system supports date rates between 6 and 48bps with adaptive fidelity.\nTitle:\nSoftware-driven sensor networks for short-range shallow water applications\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To that end, this paper presents a new architecture called ATM (\"Adding a Tutorial Model\"), which is an extension to model-tracing, that allows these tutors to engage in a dialog that is more like those in which experienced human tutors engage. Specifically, while MTTs provide hints toward doing the next problemsolving step, this 3rd generation of tutors, the ATM architecture, adds the capability to ask questions towards thinking about the knowledge behind the next problem-solving step. We present a new tutor built in ATM, called Ms. Lindquist, which is designed to carry on a tutorial dialog about algebra symbolization. The difference between ATM and MTT is the separate tutorial model that encodes pedagogical content knowledge in the form of different tutorial strategies, which were partially developed by observing an experienced human tutor. Ms. Lindquist has tutored thousands of students at www.AlgebraTutor.org. Future work will reveal if Ms. Lindquist is a better tutor because of the addition of the tutorial model.\nTitle:\nExpanding the Model-Tracing Architecture: A 3rd Generation Intelligent Tutor for Algebra Symbolization\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The dueling bandit gradient descent (DBGD) algorithm has been shown to effectively learn combinations of these features solely from user interactions. DBGD explores the search space by comparing a possibly improved ranker to the current production ranker. To this end, it uses interleaved comparison methods, which can infer with high sensitivity a preference between two rankings based only on interaction data. A limiting factor is that it can compare only to a single exploratory ranker. We propose an online learning to rank algorithm called multileave gradient descent (MGD) that extends DBGD to learn from so-called multileaved comparison methods that can compare a set of rankings instead of merely a pair. We show experimentally that MGD allows for better selection of candidates than DBGD without the need for more comparisons involving users. An important implication of our results is that orders of magnitude less user interaction data is required to find good rankers when multileaved comparisons are used within online learning to rank. Hence, fewer users need to be exposed to possibly inferior rankers and our method allows search engines to adapt more quickly to changes in user preferences.\nTitle:\nMultileave Gradient Descent for Fast Online Learning to Rank.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For classic vertex coloring, the goal is to minimize the maximum color used, and for the sum coloring problem, the goal is to minimize the sum of colors assigned to all input vertices. In the offline variant, the entire graph is presented at once, and in online problems, one vertex is presented for coloring at each time, and the only information is the identity of its neighbors among previously known vertices. In batched graph coloring, vertices are presented in k batches, for a fixed integer \\(k \\ge 2\\), such that the vertices of a batch are presented as a set, and must be colored before the vertices of the next batch are presented. This last model is an intermediate model, which bridges between the two extreme scenarios of the online and offline models. We provide several results, including a general result for sum coloring and results for the classic graph coloring problem on restricted graph classes: We show tight bounds for any graph class containing trees as a subclass (forests, bipartite graphs, planar graphs, and perfect graphs, for example), and an interesting result for interval graphs and \\(k=2\\), where the value of the (strict and asymptotic) competitive ratio depends on whether the graph is presented with its interval representation or not.\nTitle:\nBatch Coloring of Graphs.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Aggregates are very expressive, they allow to represent many problems in a more succinct and elegant way compared to aggregate-free programs. A significant amount of research work has been devoted to aggregates in the ASP community in the last years, and relevant research results on ASP with aggregates have been published, on both theoretical and practical sides. The high expressiveness of aggregates (eliminating aggregates often causes a quadratic blow-up in program size) requires suitable evaluation methods and optimization techniques for an efficient implementation. Nevertheless, in spite of the above-mentioned research developments, aggregates are treated in a quite straightforward way in most ASP systems. In this paper, we explore the exploitation of look-back techniques for an efficient implementation of aggregates. We define a reason calculus for backjumping in ASP programs with aggregates. Furthermore, we describe how these reasons can be used in order to guide look-back heuristics for programs with aggregates. We have implemented both the new reason calculus and the proposed heuristics in the DLV system, and have carried out an experimental analysis on publicly available benchmarks which shows significant performance benefits.\nTitle:\nLook-back Techniques for ASP Programs with Aggregates\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

With increasing cache sizes, coherence misses in such systems will account for a larger fraction of all cache misses. As communication latencies increase, this larger fraction of coherence misses will cause significant and increased performance losses. Tuning coherence protocols for specific communication patterns and applications can reduce communication latencies. However, these optimizations increase a protocol's design complexity, making the protocol difficult to verify. A competing approach requires parallel programmers to tune applications to work well with simpler protocols. Speculative execution has successfully improved performance in various scenarios. We propose a new type of load speculation, called coherence decoupling. Coherence decoupling is a microarchitectural mechanism that implements separate protocols for speculative use and for the eventual verification of values. The technique reduces the effect of long communication latencies while mitigating the burdens on the coherence protocol designer and the parallel programmer\nTitle:\nSpeculative incoherent cache protocols\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The performance scalability of these systems, however, is limited due to partitioning overheads. This paper addresses two of the key performance scalability limitations of composable multicore systems. We present a critical path analysis revealing that communication needed for cross-core register value delivery and fetch stalls due to misspeculation are the two worst bottlenecks that prevent efficient scaling to a large number of fused cores. To alleviate these bottlenecks, this paper proposes a fully distributed framework to exploit criticality in these architectures at different granularities. A coordinator core exploits different types of block-level communication criticality information to fine-tune critical instructions at decode and register forward pipeline stages of their executing cores. The framework exploits the fetch criticality information at a coarser granularity by reissuing all instructions in the blocks previously fetched into the merged cores. This general framework reduces competing bottlenecks in a synergic manner and achieves scalable performance/power efficiency for sequential programs when running across a large number of cores.\nTitle:\nExploiting criticality to reduce bottlenecks in distributed uniprocessors\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

These salient cues can be from spatial distributions of the features (space-based saliency) or contextual/task-dependent features (object-based saliency). Saliency models generally incorporate salient cues either in bottom-up or top-down norm separately. In this work, we combine bottom-up and top-down cues from both space- and object-based salient features on RGB-D data. In addition, we also investigated the ability of various pre-trained convolutional neural networks for extracting top-down saliency on color images based on the object dependent feature activation. We demonstrate that combining salient features from color and dept through bottom-up and top-down methods gives significant improvement on the salient object detection with space-based and object-based salient cues. RGB-D saliency integration framework yields promising results compared with the several state-of-the-art-models.\nTitle:\nAn integration of bottom-up and top-down salient cues on RGB-D data: saliency from objectness versus non-objectness.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The paper discusses the key roles of ontologies with respect to the various abstraction layers and their corresponding impact on the concomitant workproducts. In addition, a peer-to-peer-based service selecting and composing tool is suggested as a way of supporting the process.

The PPI network alignment greatly benefits the understanding of evolutionary relationship among species, helps identify conserved subnetworks, and provides extra information for functional annotations. Although a few methods have been developed for multiple PPI network alignment, the alignment quality is still far from perfect, and thus, new network alignment methods are needed. In this article, we present a novel method, denoted as ConvexAlign, for joint alignment of multiple PPI networks by convex optimization of a scoring function composed of sequence similarity, topological score, and interaction conservation score. In contrast to existing methods that generate multiple alignments in a greedy or progressive manner, our convex method optimizes alignments globally and enforces consistency among all pairwise alignments, resulting in much better alignment quality. Tested on both synthetic and real data, our experimental results show that ConvexAlign outperforms several popular methods in producing functionally coherent alignments. ConvexAlign even has a larger advantage over the others in aligning real PPI networks. ConvexAlign also finds a few conserved complexes, which cannot be detected by the other methods.\nTitle:\nJoint alignment of multiple protein-protein interaction networks via convex optimization.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Each document/datum will be represented as a fuzzy set. In this respect, the fuzzy clustering algorithm, will be constrained additionally in order to cluster fuzzy sets. Then, one needs to find a metric measure in order to detect the overlapping between documents and the cluster prototype (category). In this respect, we use one of the interclass probabilistic reparability measures known as Bhattacharyya distance, which will be incorporated in the general scheme of the fuzzy c-means algorithm for measuring the overlapping between fuzzy sets. This enables the introduction of fuzziness in the document clustering in the sense that it allows a single document to belong to more than one category. This is in line with semantic multiple interpretations conveyed by single words, which support multiple membership to several classes.

In many cases, the upcoming road geometry in front the own vehicle is of particular interest. Although a prediction of the course of the road can be provided based on map data, the accuracy is not sufficient for most driver assistance systems. The goal of this work is to achieve a more accurate and updated prediction of the road geometry at close range. Therefore, the map data is combined with the information from an existing vision-based lane detection system. Since the shape of detected road lines as well as the map data are represented by clothoid curves, the emphasis of this work is placed on the calculation, combination, and connection of clothoid segments.\nTitle:\nFusion of clothoid segments for a more accurate and updated prediction of the road geometry\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We argue that some inductive processes, like ICL, can be seen as a form of defeasible reasoning. We define a consequence relation characterizing which hypotheses can be induced from given sets of examples, and study its properties, showing they correspond to a rather well-behaved non-monotonic logic. We will also show that with the addition of a preference relation on inductive theories we can characterize the inductive bias of ICL algorithms. The second part of the paper shows how this logical characterization of inductive generalization can be integrated with another form of non-monotonic reasoning (argumentation), to define a model of multiagent ICL. This integration allows two or more agents to learn, in a consistent way, both from induction and from arguments used in the communication between them. We show that the inductive theories achieved by multiagent induction plus argumentation are sound, i.e. they are precisely the same as the inductive theories built by a single agent with all data.\nTitle:\nA defeasible reasoning model of inductive concept learning from examples and communication\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Since grid files were originally developed to speed up point (exact match) and range (nearest neighbors within a threshold) queries on multidimensional data with a fixed number of attributes, we extend them to cope with data provided with a varying number of attributes and to deal with a new class of queries relevant to image databases, namely, nearest neighbor queries.

Teachers are incorporating them increasingly into their practice, however it is not common to find both of them aligned. We are working on the definition of a learning design process that takes monitoring issues into account and leads to better and more efficient monitoring when the scripts are put into practice. Moreover, if the learning design is based on patterns, the information given by these patterns can help to shape this enhanced design process. This paper presents a pilot study where a participatory design approach was followed. The first author and a teacher co-designed a CSCL situation in higher education based on the Jigsaw pattern. The analysis of the co-design process gave us a first structure of the data to be considered in monitoring-aware learning designs and a set of measures for enhancing monitoring at design-time.\nTitle:\nTowards a monitoring-aware design process for CSCL scripts\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

This behaviour is highly unlikely to occur in idealized ciphers but persists, for instance, in 5-round AES. Interestingly, the property of key difference invariant bias is independent of the bias value \u03b5 itself and only depends on the form of linear characteristics comprising the linear approximation in question as well as on the key schedule of the cipher. We propose a statistical distinguisher for this property and turn it into an key recovery. As an illustration, we apply our novel cryptanalytic technique to mount related-key attacks on two recent block ciphers -- LBlock and TWINE. In these cases, we break 2 and 3 more rounds, respectively, than the best previous attacks.\nTitle:\nKey Difference Invariant Bias in Block Ciphers\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

During 2001, the annual TREC activity, which has been benchmarking the performance of information retrieval techniques on a range of media for 10 years, included a \"track\" or activity which allowed investigation into approaches to support searching through a video library. This paper is not intended to provide a comprehensive picture of the different approaches taken by the TREC2001 video track participants but instead we give an overview of the TREC video search task and a thumbnail sketch of the approaches taken by different groups. The reason for writing this paper is to highlight the message from the TREC video track that there are now a variety of approaches available for searching and browsing through digital video archives, that these approaches do work, are scalable to larger archives and can yield useful retrieval performance for users. This has important implications in making digital libraries of video information attainable.\nTitle:\nThe TREC2001 Video Track: Information Retrieval on Digital Video Information\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

As part of the Collaborative Research Center 653 which investigates micro-structured metallic surfaces for inherent mechanical data storage, we research into a stable and reliable optical readout of the written data. Since this comprises a qualitative surface reconstruction, we use directed illumination to make the micro structures visible. Then we apply a spectral analysis to obtain image partitioning and perform signal tracking enhanced by a customized Hidden Markov Model. In this paper, we derive the algorithms used and demonstrate reading data from a surface with 1.6kbit/cm2 from a micro-structured groove which varies by only 3\u03bc m in depth (thus a \"scratch\"). We demonstrate the system's robustness with experiments with real and artificially-rendered surfaces.\nTitle:\nReading from Scratch --- A Vision-System for Reading Data on Micro-structured Surfaces\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The loop body contains a set of coarse grain tasks whose computational weights change during the course of the iterations. Using the macro dataflow task: model and software pipelining techniques, we develop an algorithm for computing a heuristic schedule, and provide analytic and experimental results on the correctness and asymptotic performance of this schedule. Using this result, we can show the impact of partitioning on the performance of parallelization. While this result is effective for a class of loops, there are many other methods proposed for loop parallelization. An interesting fundamental question is whether every instance of a nested loop can be efficiently executed, We present some positive and negative results on this issue.\nTitle:\nOn symbolic scheduling and parallel complexity of loops.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

While prior work suggests that trolling behavior is confined to a vocal and antisocial minority, we demonstrate that ordinary people can engage in such behavior as well. We propose two primary trigger mechanisms: the individual's mood, and the surrounding context of a discussion (e.g., exposure to prior trolling behavior). Through an experiment simulating an online discussion, we find that both negative mood and seeing troll posts by others significantly increases the probability of a user trolling, and together double this probability. To support and extend these results, we study how these same mechanisms play out in the wild via a data-driven, longitudinal analysis of a large online news discussion community. This analysis exposes temporal mood effects, and explores long range patterns of repeated exposure to trolling. A predictive model of trolling behavior reveals that mood and discussion context together can explain trolling behavior better than an individual's history of trolling. These results combine to suggest that ordinary people can, under the right circumstances, behave like trolls.\nTitle:\nAnyone Can Become a Troll: Causes of Trolling Behavior in Online Discussions.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We propose a novel automatic framework to efficiently estimate 3D body shapes under clothes. We construct a database of 3D naked and dressed body pairs, based on which we learn how to predict 3D positions of body landmarks (which further constrain a parametric human body model) automatically according to dressed-human silhouettes. Critical vertices are selected on 3D registered human bodies as landmarks to represent body shapes, so as to avoid the time-consuming vertices correspondences finding process for parametric body reconstruction. Our method can estimate 3D body shapes from dressed-human silhouettes within 4 seconds, while the fastest method reported previously need 1 minute. In addition, our estimation error is within the size tolerance for clothing industry. We dress 6042 naked bodies with 3 sets of common clothes by physically based cloth simulation technique. To the best of our knowledge, We are the first to construct such a database containing 3D naked and dressed body pairs and our database may contribute to the areas of human body shapes estimation and cloth simulation.\nTitle:\n3D Body Shapes Estimation from Dressed-Human Silhouettes.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We propose a physically based algorithm that automatically synthesizes crumpling sounds for a given thin shell animation. The resulting sound is a superposition of individually synthesized clicking sounds corresponding to visually significant and insignificant buckling events. We identify visually significant buckling events on the dynamically evolving thin surface mesh, and instantiate visually insignificant buckling events via a stochastic model that seeks to mimic the power-law distribution of buckling energies observed in many materials. In either case, the synthesis of a buckling sound employs linear modal analysis of the deformed thin shell. Because different buckling events in general occur at different deformed configurations, the question arises whether the calculation of linear modes can be reused. We amortize the cost of the linear modal analysis by dynamically partitioning the mesh into nearly rigid pieces: the modal analysis of a rigidly moving piece is retained over time, and the modal analysis of the assembly is obtained via Component Mode Synthesis (CMS). We illustrate our approach through a series of examples and a perceptual user study, demonstrating the utility of the sound synthesis method in producing realistic sounds at practical computation times.\nTitle:\nCrumpling sound synthesis\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

On the contrary, the high reliability and performance of communication links, combined with architectural models that facilitate transparent access to distributed computational and storage resources, propel the development of integrated e-government platforms that support increased citizen mobility. The price we have to pay is the complexity introduced in the design of the security mechanisms required for protecting several heterogeneous information systems-each one supporting some of the services offered through the e-government integrated environment-and ensuring user privacy. This paper demonstrates that the security services offered by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can be employed for fulfilling most of the identified security requirements for an integrated e-government platform. The list of security requirements has been compiled by adopting an organisational framework that facilitates the classification of e-government services according to the security requirements they exhibit. The proposed approach has been applied, as a case study, to the e-government system 'Webocrat', identifying its security requirements and then designing a PKI-based security architecture for fulfilling them.\nTitle:\nSecurity requirements for e-government services: a methodological approach for developing a common PKI-based security policy\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Correlations are created naturally by the usual associative connections. In our simulations, temporal patterns take the form of oscillatory bursts of activity. Model oscillators consist of pairs of local cell populations connected appropriately.

In such systems, processors are usually physically distributed, implying that the communication cost is considerably higher than in tightly coupled multiprocessors. Therefore, scheduling and mapping algorithms for such systems must schedule the tasks as well as the communication traffic by treating both the processors and communication links as important resources. We propose an algorithm that achieves these objectives and adapts its tasks scheduling and mapping decisions according to the given network topology. Just like tasks, messages are also scheduled and mapped to suitable links during the minimization of the finish times of tasks. Heterogeneity of processors is exploited by scheduling critical tasks to the fastest processors. Our extensive experimental study has demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is efficient, robust, and yields consistent performance over a wide range of scheduling parameters\nTitle:\nLink contention-constrained scheduling and mapping of tasks and messages to a network of heterogeneous processors\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Examples of this operation in various data analytic communities include searching for nonlinear combinations of attributes that contribute significantly to a regression (Statistics), searching for items to include in a decision list (machine learning) and association rule hunting (Data Mining). This paper investigates a new, efficient approach to this class of problems, called RADSEARCH (Real-valued All-Dimensions-tree Search). RADSEARCH finds the global optimum, and this gives us the opportunity to empirically evaluate the question: apart from algorithmic elegance what does this attention to optimality buy us? We compare RADSEARCH with other recent successful search algorithms such as CN2, PRIM, APriori, OPUS and DenseMiner. Finally, we introduce RADREG, a new regression algorithm for learning real-valued outputs based on RADSEARCHing for highorder interactions.\nTitle:\nReal-valued all-dimensions search: low-overhead rapid searching over subsets of attributes\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, even if a personal device is able to access to different kinds of information, often it does not represent the best solution to retrieve a stream of data from the Internet or to visualize it with an acceptable quality. This problem is promoting several research efforts oriented to the definition of techniques and network components able to support the migration of working sessions from a device to a more apt one. Research results related to the mobility of hosts are not sufficient to solve the problem of user mobility.

It is by no doubt true that the more AI algorithms and methods are used the more they tend to depart from a pure \"AI\" spirit and end to refer to the sphere of standard software. In a sense, AI seems strongly connected with ideas, methods and tools that are not (yet) used by the general public. On the contrary, a more realistic view of it would be a rich and pervading set of successful paradigms and approaches. Industry is currently perceiving semantic technologies as a key contribution of AI to innovation. In this paper a survey of current industrial experiences is used to discuss different semantic technologies at work in heterogeneous areas, ranging from Web services to semantic search and recommender systems. The resulting picture confirms the vitality of the area and allows to sketch a general taxonomy of approaches, that is the main contribution of this paper.\nTitle:\nSemantic Technologies For Industry: From Knowledge Modeling And Integration To Intelligent Applications\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

While such systems provide useful services individually, there is a need for a meta-service to enable comparison and ensemble of such services, offering optimal solutions for various purposes. Results We have integrated nine event extraction systems in the U-Compare framework, making them inter-compatible and interoperable with other U-Compare components. The U-Compare event meta-service provides various meta-level features for comparison and ensemble of multiple event extraction systems. Experimental results show that the performance improvements achieved by the ensemble are significant. ConclusionsWhile individual event extraction systems themselves provide useful features for bio text mining, the U-Compare meta-service is expected to improve the accessibility to the individual systems, and to enable meta-level uses over multiple event extraction systems such as comparison and ensemble. \u00a9 2011 Kano et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nTitle:\nU-Compare bio-event meta-service: compatible BioNLP event extraction services.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our goal is to create a simple and low-cost casual-viewing design which could be retrofitted and eventually be embedded into smartphones, instead of using larger spatial viewing accessories. We explore different designs and implemented several prototypes. One prototype uses thin and light near-to-eye optics with a smartphone display, thus providing the user with the functionality of a large, high-resolution virtual display. Our designs also enable 3D user interfaces. Easy interaction through various gestures and other modalities is possible by using the inertial and other sensors and camera of the smartphone.

[Question/Problem] Laws contain elements such as conditions and derogations that generate a space of possible compliance alternatives. During requirements engineering, an analyst has to select one of these compliance alternatives and ensure that the requirements specification she is putting together complies with that alternative. However, the space of such alternatives is often large. [Principal ideas and results] This paper extends N\u00f2mos 2, a modeling framework for laws, to support modeling of and reasoning with stakeholder preferences and priorities. The problem of preferred regulatory compliance is then defined as a problem of finding a compliance alternative that matches best stakeholder preferences. [Contribution] The paper defines the concept of preference between situations and integrates it with the N\u00f2mos 2 modeling language. It also presents a reasoning tool for preferences and illustrates its use with an extract from a use case concerning the Italian law on Electronic Health Record.\nTitle:\nChoosing compliance solutions through stakeholder preferences\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Some of the software resides on application hosts that are not necessarily trustworthy. The integrity of these software components is therefore essential to the reliability and trustworthiness of the survivability scheme. In this paper we address the problem of protecting trusted software on untrustworthy hosts by software transformations. Our techniques include a systematic introduction of aliases in combination with a \"break-down\" of the program control-flow; transforming high-level control transfers to indirect addressing through aliased pointers. In so doing, we transform programs to a form that yields data flow information very slowly and/or with little precision. We present a theoretical result which shows that a precise analysis of the transformed program, in the general case, is NP-hard and demonstrate the applicability of our techniques with empirical results.\nTitle:\nProtection of software-based survivability mechanisms\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To deal with this, they will not only need to be programmable in terms of instruction set processors, but also at least partial reconfigurability will be required. In this context, it is important for applications to optimally exploit the memory hierarchy under varying memory availability. This article presents a mapping strategy for wavelet-based applications: depending on the encountered conditions, it switches to different memory optimized instantations or localizations, permitting up to 51% energy gains in memory accesses. Systematic and parameterized mapping guidelines indicate which localization should be selected when, for varying algorithmic wavelet parameters. The results have been formalized and generalized to be applicable to more general wavelet-based applications.\nTitle:\nExploiting Varying Resource Requirements in Wavelet-based Applications in Dynamic Execution Environments\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The clustering procedure relies on the quality of the database searching routine and further improves its results based on a set-theoretic analysis of a highly redundant yet efficient to generate cluster system. Result: Overall, we achieve unambiguous assignment of 80% of SWISS-PROT sequences to non-overlapping sequence clusters in an entirely automatic fashion. Our results are compared to an expert-generated clustering for validation. The database searching method is fast and the clustering technique does not require time-consuming all-against-all comparison.

In particular, our scheme can be safely deployed in settings in which no a-priori bound on the number of encryptions and/or users is known. As a central technical building block, we devise the first structure-preserving signature scheme with a tight security reduction. (This signature scheme may be of independent interest.) Combining this scheme with Groth---Sahai proofs yields a tightly simulation-sound non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system for group equations. If we use this proof system in the Naor---Yung double encryption scheme, we obtain a tightly IND-CCA secure PKE scheme from the decision linear assumption. We point out that our techniques are not specific to PKE security. Rather, we view our signature scheme and proof system as general building blocks that can help to achieve a tight security reduction.\nTitle:\nTightly Secure Signatures and Public-Key Encryption.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The purpose of the concept of quasi-randomness is to express how much a given graph \u201cresembles\u201d a random one. Moreover, a regular partition approximates a given graph by a bounded number of quasi-random graphs. Regarding quasi-randomness, we present a new spectral characterization of low discrepancy, which extends to sparse graphs. Concerning regular partitions, we introduce a concept of regularity that takes into account vertex weights, and show that if $G=(V,E)$ satisfies a certain boundedness condition, then $G$ admits a regular partition. In addition, building on the work of Alon and Naor [Proceedings of the 36th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), Chicago, IL, ACM, New York, 2004, pp. 72-80], we provide an algorithm that computes a regular partition of a given (possibly sparse) graph $G$ in polynomial time. As an application, we present a polynomial time approximation scheme for MAX CUT on (sparse) graphs without \u201cdense spots.\u201d\nTitle:\nQuasi-Randomness and Algorithmic Regularity for Graphs with General Degree Distributions\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Both properties are believed to lead to good generalization ability. We show that these two properties are fundamentally at odds with each other: a sparse algorithm cannot be stable and vice versa. Thus, one has to trade off sparsity and stability in designing a learning algorithm. In particular, our general result implies that $\\ell_1$-regularized regression (Lasso) cannot be stable, while $\\ell_2$-regularized regression is known to have strong stability properties and is therefore not sparse.\nTitle:\nSparse Algorithms are not Stable: A No-free-lunch Theorem.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Specifically, post-retrieval predictors analyze the result list of top-retrieved documents. Departing from the zero-feedback approach, in this paper we show that relevance feedback for even very few top ranked documents can be exploited to dramatically improve prediction quality. Specifically, applying state-of-the-art zero-feedback-based predictors to only a very few relevant documents, rather than to the entire result list as originally designed, substantially improves prediction quality. This novel form of prediction is based on quantifying properties of relevant documents that can attest to query performance. We also show that integrating prediction based on relevant documents with zero-feedback-based prediction is highly effective; specifically, with respect to utilizing state-of-the-art direct estimates of retrieval effectiveness when minimal feedback is available.\nTitle:\nQuery-Performance Prediction Using Minimal Relevance Feedback\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Furthermore, the PSO strategy eliminates degradation of generalization error due to overtrain- ing resulting from the training set size, number of training epochs, and data set structure. Overall results obtained with the PSO strategy reveal the importance of optimizing parameters and weights using a consistent objective function. In fact, the parameters found using this strategy vary significantly according to, e.g., training set size and data set structure, and always differ considerably from the popular choice of parameters that allows to minimize resources.\nTitle:\nParticle Swarm Optimization of Fuzzy ARTMAP Parameters\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, possible applications, and even their raw functionality are constrained by the types of sensors that are currently available. Accelerometers and gyroscopes struggle to capture complex user activities. Microphones and image sensors are more powerful but capture privacy sensitive information. Physiological sensors are obtrusive to users as they often require skin contact and must be placed at certain body positions to function. In contrast, radio-based sensing uses wireless radio signals to capture movements of different parts of the body, and therefore provides a contactless and privacy-preserving approach to detect and monitor human activities. In this paper, we contribute to the search for new sensing modalities for the next generation of wearable devices by exploring the feasibility of mobile radio-based human activity recognition. We believe radio-based sensing has the potential to fundamentally transform wearables as we currently know them. As the first step to achieve our vision, we have designed and developed HeadScan, a first-of-its-kind wearable for radio-based sensing of a number of human activities that involve head and mouth movements. HeadScan only requires a pair of small antennas placed on the shoulder and collar and one wearable unit worn on the arm or the belt of the user. HeadScan uses the fine-grained CSI measurements extracted from radio signals and incorporates a novel signal processing pipeline that converts the raw CSI measurements into the targeted human activities. To examine the feasibility and performance of HeadScan, we have collected approximate 50.5 hours data from seven users. Our wide-ranging experiments include comparisons to a conventional skin-contact audio-based sensing approach to tracking the same set of head and mouth-related activities. Our experimental results highlight the enormous potential of our radio-based mobile sensing approach and provide guidance to future explorations.\nTitle:\nHeadScan: A Wearable System for Radio-Based Sensing of Head and Mouth-Related Activities.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The question for research is how to support learners in unstructured and emerging environments to become aware of their often unconscious learning processes. Based on this question, two design studies and three experiments were conducted, to analyze the effects of indicators on informal learning. From the findings of the research we identified that the reception of interaction information is dependent on the context of the learners. \"Relatedness\" seems to be important for designing indicators that support learning.\nTitle:\nSupporting Reflection in Informal Learning\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Most developments focus on the technology that enables enterprises to describe, publish and compose application services, and to communicate with applications of other enterprises according to their service descriptions. In this paper, we argue that this technology should be complented with modelling languages, design methods and techniques supporting service-oriented design. We consider service-oriented design as the process of designing application support for business processes, using the service-oriented paradigm. We assume that service-oriented computing technology is used to implent application support. The paper presents two main contributions to the area of service-oriented design. First, a systatic service-oriented design approach is presented, identifying generic design milestones and a method for assessing the conformance between application designs at related abstraction levels. Second, a conceptual model for service-oriented design is presented that provides a common and precise understanding of the terminology used in service-oriented design. The ISDL modelling language is introduced to express service-oriented designs, based on this conceptual model.

An experimental evaluation with a prototype implementation shows the better behavior of one of the proposed mappings over the other two.

Whilst lexicographically ordering the rows (columns) breaks all the row (column) symmetries, lexicographically ordering both the rows and the columns fails to break all the compositions of the row and column symmetries. Nevertheless, our experimental results show that this is effective at dealing with these compositions of symmetries. We extend these results to cope with symmetries in any number of dimensions, with partial symmetries, and with symmetric values. Finally, we identify special cases where all compositions of the row and column symmetries can be eliminated by the addition of only a linear number of symmetry-breaking constraints.\nTitle:\nBreaking Row and Column Symmetries in Matrix Models\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Clustering is an optimization procedure based on a specific clustering criterion. Clustering combination can be regarded as a technique that constructs and processes multiple clustering criteria. Since the global and local clustering criteria are complementary rather than competitive, combining these two types of clustering criteria may enhance the clustering performance. In our past work, a multi-objective programming based simultaneous clustering combination algorithm has been proposed, which incorporates multiple criteria into an objective function by a weighting method, and solves this problem with constrained nonlinear optimization programming. But this algorithm has high computational complexity. Here a sequential combination approach is investigated, which first uses the global criterion based clustering to produce an initial result, then uses the local criterion based information to improve the initial result with a probabilistic relaxation algorithm or linear additive model. Compared with the simultaneous combination method, sequential combination has low computational complexity. Results on some simulated data and standard test data are reported. It appears that clustering performance improvement can be achieved at low cost through sequential combination.\nTitle:\nSequential combination methods for data clustering analysis\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Cursive scripts with complex character shapes, such as Arabic and Persian, make the recognition task even more challenging. This complexity requires sophisticated representations and learning methods, and comprehensive data samples. A direct approaches to achieve a better performance is focusing on designing more powerful building blocks of a handwriting recognition system which are pattern representation and pattern classification . In this paper we aim to scale up the efficiency of online recognition systems for Arabic characters by integrating novel representation techniques into efficient classification methods. We investigate the idea of incorporating two novel feature representations for online character data. We advocate the usefulness and practicality of these features in classification methods using neural networks and support vector machines. The combinations of proposed representations with related classifiers can offer a module for recognition tasks which can deal with any two-dimensional online pattern. Our empirical results confirm the higher distinctiveness and robustness to character deformations obtained by the proposed representation compared to currently available techniques.\nTitle:\nIntegration of Contextual Information in Online Handwriting Representation\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

To achieve efficient and scalable query processing, we develop an index, together with effective pruning rules and efficient search algorithms. We propose techniques that use this infrastructure to answer aggregation queries. We also propose an effective maintenance algorithm to handle online updates over RDF repositories.

In general, when a database is scaled up, a large amount of memory is required and retrieval accuracy drops due to insufficient discrimination power of features. To solve these problems, we propose three improvements: memory reduction by sampling feature points, improvement of discrimination power by increasing the number of feature dimensions and stabilizing features by reducing redundancy. From the experimental results, we have confirmed that the proposed method realizes 50% memory reduction, and achieves 99.4% accuracy and 38ms processing time for a database of 10 million pages.\nTitle:\nReal-Time Document Image Retrieval for a 10 Million Pages Database with a Memory Efficient and Stability Improved LLAH\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The state-of-the-art news extraction method is based on template-level wrapper induction, which has two serious limitations. 1) It cannot correctly extract pages belonging to an unseen template until the wrapper for that template has been generated. 2) It is costly to maintain up-to-date wrappers for hundreds of websites, because any change of a template may lead to the invalidation of the corresponding wrapper. In this paper we formalize news extraction as a machine learning problem and learn a template-independent wrapper using a very small number of labeled news pages from a single site. Novel features dedicated to news titles and bodies are developed respectively. Correlations between the news title and the news body are exploited. Our template-independent wrapper can extract news pages from different sites regardless of templates. In experiments, a wrapper is learned from 40 pages from a single news site. It achieved 98.1% accuracy over 3,973 news pages from 12 news sites.\nTitle:\nNews article extraction with template-independent wrapper\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We present Bayesian active learning techniques for stimulus selection given past experiences. In particular, we consider the unknown parameters as stochastic variables and use A-optimality and D-optimality principles to choose optimal stimuli. We derive myopic cost functions in order to maximize the information gain concerning network parameters at each time step. We also derive the A-optimal and D-optimal estimations of the additive noise that perturbs the dynamical system of the RNN. Here we investigate myopic as well as non-myopic estimations, and study the problem of simultaneous estimation of both the system parameters and the noise. Employing conjugate priors our derivations remain approximation-free and give rise to simple update rules for the online learning of the parameters. The efficiency of our method is demonstrated for a number of selected cases, including the task of controlled independent component analysis.\nTitle:\nIdentification of Recurrent Neural Networks by Bayesian Interrogation Techniques\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Unfortunately, by storing duplicate data chunks just once, de-duped system improves storage utilization at cost of error resilience or reliability. In this paper, R-ADMAD, a high reliability provision mechanism is proposed. It packs variable-length data chunks into fixed sized objects, and exploits ECC codes to encode the objects and distributes them among the storage nodes in a redundancy group, which is dynamically generated according to current status and actual failure domains. Upon failures, R-ADMAD proposes a distributed and dynamic recovery process. Experimental results show that R-ADMAD can provide the same storage utilization as RAID-like schemes, but comparable reliability to replication based schemes with much more redundancy. The average recovery time of R-ADMAD based configurations is about 2-6 times less than RAID-like schemes. Moreover, R-ADMAD can provide dynamic load balancing even without the involvement of the overloaded storage nodes.\nTitle:\nR-ADMAD: high reliability provision for large-scale de-duplication archival storage systems\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

They are very efficient since they can be implemented by recursive filtering, and their separability allows a straightforward implementation in any dimension. We analyze their behavior on a parallel computer and demonstrate that parallel AOS schemes on a modern shared-memory multiprocessor system with 8 processors allow a speed-up of two orders of magnitude in comparison to the widely-used explicit scheme on a single processor.\nTitle:\nParallel Implementations of AOS Schemes: A Fast Way of Nonlinear Diffusion Filtering\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The IEEE 802.11 standard does not specify any RA preferences allowing for a competition in performance among vendors, thus numerous proprietary solutions coexist. While the RA schemes implemented in individual user terminals are unknown to the AP of a hotspot, it is well known that the way how individual stations adapt their rates strongly influences the performance of the whole WLAN cell. Therefore, the knowledge of the scheme applied by each station may be useful for the radio resource management in complex networks (e.g., HetNets or dense WLAN deployments in enterprise networks). In this paper, we present a novel approach to estimate the features of the RA schemes implemented in individual stations and demonstrate its efficiency using both simulated WLAN configurations as well as measurements.\nTitle:\nDARA: Estimating the behavior of data rate adaptation algorithms in WLAN hotspots.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Using the framework of probabilistic mod- els allows us to integrate detailed speech models and models of realistic non-stationary noise signals in a principled manner. The framework transforms the denoising problem into a problem of Bayes-optimal signal estimation, producing minimum mean square error estimators of desired features of clean speech from noisy data. We describe a fast and efficient implementation of an algorithm that computes these estimators. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated in robust speech recognition experiments, using the Wall Street Journal speech corpus and Microsoft Whisper large-vocabulary continuous speech recog- nizer. Results show significantly lower word error rates than those under noisy-matched condition. In particular, when the denoising algorithm is applied to the noisy training data and subsequently the recognizer is retrained, very low error rates are obtained.\nTitle:\nA new method for speech denoising and robust speech recognition using probabilistic models for clean speech and for noise\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

These data bear a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better distinguished and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The wide-spread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimensionreduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context style of visualization in 3D. We discuss our approach with respect to clinical datasets from the three major application areas: ischemic stroke diagnosis, breast tumor diagnosis, as well as the diagnosis of the coronary heart disease (CHD). It turns out that the significance of perfusion parameters strongly depends on the individual patient, scanning parameters, and data pre-processing.\nTitle:\nInteractive visual analysis of perfusion data.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper, we introduce the new clustering algorithm DBCLASD (Distribution-Based Clustering of LArge Spatial Databases) to discover clusters of this type. The results of experiments demonstrate that DBCLASD, contrary to partitioning algorithms such as CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based on RANdomized Search), discovers clusters of arbitrary shape. Furthermore, DBCLASD does not require any input parameters, in contrast to the clustering algorithm DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) requiring two input parameters, which may be difficult to provide for large databases. In terms of efficiency, DBCLASD is between CLARANS and DBSCAN, close to DBSCAN. Thus, the efficiency of DBCLASD on large spatial databases is very attractive when considering its nonparametric nature and its good quality for clusters of arbitrary shape\nTitle:\nA distribution-based clustering algorithm for mining in large spatial databases\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper we tackle this challenge in a semi-online workload management system allocating tasks with uncertain duration to physical servers. Our semi-online framework, based on a bin packing approach, allows us to gather information on incoming tasks during a short time window before deciding on their assignments. Our contributions are as follows: (i) we propose a formal framework capturing the semi-online consolidation problem; (ii) we propose a new dynamic and real-time allocation algorithm based on the incremental merging of bins; and (iii) an adaptation of standard bin packing heuristics with a local search algorithm for the semi-online context considered here. We provide a systematic study of the impact of varying time-period size and varying the degrees of uncertainty on the duration of incoming tasks. The policies are compared in terms of solution quality and solving time on a data-set extracted from a real-world cluster trace.\nTitle:\nSemi-online task assignment policies for workload consolidation in cloud computing systems.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In addition, our proposed approach optimizes the program with respect to memory endurance constraints which is of particular importance for in-memory computing architectures.\nTitle:\nAn MIG-based compiler for programmable logic-in-memory architectures.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

DFT features a high fault detection rate while avoiding the intense scalability problems to achieve full path coverage. In this paper we propose to apply data flow testing for SystemC virtual prototypes (VPs). Our contribution is twofold: First, we develop a set of SystemC specific coverage criteria for data flow testing. This requires to consider the SystemC semantics of using non-preemptive thread scheduling with shared memory communication and event-based synchronization. Second, we explain how to automatically compute the data flow coverage result for a given VP using a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques. The coverage result provides clear suggestions for the testing engineer to add new testcases in order to improve the coverage result. Our experimental results on real-world VPs demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of our analysis approach and the SystemC specific coverage criteria to improve the testsuite.\nTitle:\nData flow testing for virtual prototypes.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Therefore, in the last years several encodings have been developed. Independently, also new solvers have been introduced lifting Boolean Satisfiability to higher levels of abstraction, e.g. SAT Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers and word level solvers. Both support bit-vector logic and thus allow more compact encodings of the problems. In this paper we investigate the efficiency of these new solver paradigms applied to optimization problems. We show for two case studies - graph coloring and exact synthesis of reversible logic - that the resulting problem instances can be reduced with respect to the size. In addition for the synthesis problem significant run-time improvements can be achieved.\nTitle:\nUsing Higher Levels of Abstraction for Solving Optimization Problems by Boolean Satisfiability\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Such information has been commonly represented by two types of constraints: pairwise constraints and relative constraints, regarding similarities about instance pairs and triplets, respectively. Prior work has mostly considered these two types of constraints separately and developed individual algorithms to learn from each type. In practice, however, it is critical to understand/compare the usefulness of the two types of constraints as well as the cost of acquiring them, which has not been studied before. This paper provides an extensive comparison of clustering with these two types of constraints. Specifically, we compare their impacts both on human users that provide such constraints and on the learning system that incorporates such constraints into clustering. In addition, to ensure that the comparison of clustering is performed on equal ground (without the potential bias introduced by different learning algorithms), we propose a probabilistic semi-supervised clustering framework that can learn from either type of constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised clustering framework is highly effective at utilizing both types of constraints to aid clustering. Our user study provides valuable insights regarding the impact of the constraints on human users, and our experiments on clustering with the human-labeled constraints reveal that relative constraint is often more efficient at improving clustering.\nTitle:\nComparing Clustering with Pairwise and Relative Constraints: A Unified Framework.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Among the many potential attacks that target or exploit browsers, vulnerabilities in browser extensions have received relatively little attention. Currently, extensions are vetted by manual inspection, which is time consuming and subject to human error. In this paper, we present VEX, a framework for applying static information flow analysis to JavaScript code to identify security vulnerabilities in browser extensions. We describe several patterns of flows that can lead to privilege escalations in Firefox extensions. VEX analyzes Firefox extensions for such flow patterns using high-precision, context-sensitive, flow-sensitive static analysis. We subject 2460 browser extensions to the analysis, and VEX finds 5 of the 18 previously known vulnerabilities and 7 previously unknown vulnerabilities.\nTitle:\nVetting browser extensions for security vulnerabilities with VEX\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our approach operates on low-resolution intensity images that are obtained when the robot grasps an object. We apply a bag-of-words approach for object identification. By means of unsupervised clustering on training data, our approach learns a vocabulary from tactile observations which is used to generate a histogram codebook. The histogram codebook models distributions over the vocabulary and is the core identification mechanism. As the objects are larger than the sensor, the robot typically needs multiple grasp actions at different positions to uniquely identify an object. To reduce the number of required grasp actions, we apply a decision-theoretic framework that minimizes the entropy of the probabilistic belief about the type of the object. In our experiments carried out with various industrial and household objects, we demonstrate that our approach is able to discriminate between a large set of objects. We furthermore show that using our approach, a robot is able to distinguish visually similar objects that have different elasticity properties by using only the information from the touch sensor.\nTitle:\nObject identification with tactile sensors using bag-of-features\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We primarily focus on actions in the form of a classification. Based on the framework we derive several analytical and empirical results that shed light on MBR algorithms. We introduce the notion of an MBR transform, and discuss its utility for learning algorithms.

Three eye tracking experiments that we undertook are discussed and compared to additional work in this area, revealing recurring behaviors and trends. The first two studies are described in greater detail in Granka, Joachims, & Gay (2004), Lorigo et al. (2006), and Pan et al. (2007), and the third study is described for the first time in this article. These studies reveal how users view the ranked results on a search engine results page (SERP), the relationship between the search result abstracts viewed and those clicked on, and whether gender, search task, or search engine influence these behaviors. In addition, we discuss a key challenge that arose in all three studies that applies to the use of eye tracking in studying online behaviors which is due to the limited support for analyzing scanpaths, or sequences of eye fixations. To meet this challenge, we present a preliminary approach that involves a graphical visualization to compare a path with a group of paths. We conclude by summarizing our findings and discussing future work in further understanding online search behavior with the help of eye tracking. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\nTitle:\nEye tracking and online search: Lessons learned and challenges ahead\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The extensive theory of these protocols, however, deals almost exclusively with classical attackers. If we accept that quantum information processing is the most realistic model of physically feasible computation, then we must ask: what classical protocols remain secure against quantum attackers? Our main contribution is showing the existence of classical two-party protocols for the secure evaluation of any polynomial-time function under reasonable computational assumptions (for example, it suffices that the learning with errors problem be hard for quantum polynomial time). Our result shows that the basic two-party feasibility picture from classical cryptography remains unchanged in a quantum world.\nTitle:\nClassical cryptographic protocols in a quantum world\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Much of these spatio-temporal data can be used by organizations and applications, for statistical analysis or to provide services that are based on data. By letting people sell the data they produce, to different consumers, both sides can benefit. Thus, we present here a visionary idea of a geosocial marketplace where people and organizations can sell, buy and exchange geosocial data, that is, trade with spatio-temporal data pertaining people. We discuss the involved challenges, such as how to define supply and demand, pricing data, privacy issues and measuring the amount of data being exchanged. We explain the importance of the approach and its applicability. We believe that the proposed vision could motivate followup research in the area of sharing and exchanging spatio-temporal data as well as determining appropriate price points.\nTitle:\nAn online marketplace for geosocial data.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Algorithms and representations for dynamic graph processing provide the ability to scale as needed for enterprise-level deployments on real-time data streams. We have also developed a visual language for specifying combinations of features, baselines, peer groups, time periods, and algorithms to detect anomalies suggestive of instances of insider threat behavior. We defined over 100 data features in seven categories based on approximately 5.5 million actions per day from approximately 5,500 users.

How much is the loss in the provided security guarantees due to the selfish nature of attacks and defenses? The Price of Defense was recently introduced in [7] as a worst-case measure, over all associated Nash equilibria, of this loss. In the particular strategic game considered in [7], there are two classes of confronting randomized players on a graph G(V, E): \u03bdattackers, each choosing vertices and wishing to minimize the probability of being caught, and a single defender, who chooses edges and gains the expected number of attackers it catches. In this work, we continue the study of the Price of Defense. We obtain the following results: \u2013 The Price of Defense is at least $\\frac{|V|}{2}$; this implies that the Perfect Matching Nash equilibria considered in [7] are optimal with respect to the Price of Defense, so that the lower bound is tight. \u2013 We define Defense-Optimal graphs as those admitting a Nash equilibrium that attains the (tight) lower bound of $\\frac{|V|}{2}$. We obtain: \u2219 A graph is Defense-Optimal if and only if it has a Fractional Perfect Matching. Since graphs with a Fractional Perfect Matching are recognizable in polynomial time, the same holds for Defense-Optimal graphs. \u2219 We identify a very simple graph that is Defense-Optimal but has no Perfect Matching Nash equilibrium. \u2013 Inspired by the established connection between Nash equilibria and Fractional Perfect Matchings, we transfer a known bivaluedness result about Fractional Matchings to a certain class of Nash equilibria. So, the connection to Fractional Graph Theory may be the key to revealing the combinatorial structure of Nash equilibria for our network security game.\nTitle:\nThe price of defense and fractional matchings\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Since 2004, many types of this method have been proposed. In this paper, we consider the 2-layer nonlinear Piece in Hand method as proposed by Tsuji et al. in 2009. The key point of this method is to introduce an invertible quadratic polynomial map on the plaintext variables to add perturbation to the original MPKC. An additional quadratic map allows the owner of the secret key to remove this perturbation from the system. By our analysis, we find that the security of the enhanced scheme depends mainly on the structure of the quadratic polynomials of this auxiliary map. The two examples proposed by Tsuji et al. for this map can not resist the Linearization Equations attack. Given a valid ciphertext, we can easily get a public key which is equivalent to that of the underlying MPKC. If there exists an algorithm that can recover the plaintext corresponding to a valid ciphertext of the underlying MPKC, we can construct an algorithm that can recover the plaintext corresponding to a valid ciphertext of the enhanced MPKC.\nTitle:\nLinearization Equation Attack On 2-Layer Nonlinear Piece In Hand Method\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, to control this new type of robots using conventional model-based robotic control approaches is generally ineffective. In this paper, we investigate the challenge to embed and switch among multiple behaviors for an octopus-inspired soft robotic arm. An online learning method for reservoir computing is exploited for this task. This online learning method does not require a separate teaching data collection phase; thus, it has the potential to achieve autonomy in soft robots. Our result shows the feasibility of this approach.\nTitle:\nOnline Learning For Behavior Switching In A Soft Robotic Arm\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We prove that our generalization is no harder than DDH through a concrete reduction that we show to be rather tight in most practical cases. One important consequence of our result is that it yields significantly simpler security proofs for protocols that use extensions of DDH. We exemplify in the case of several group-key exchange protocols (among others we give an elementary, direct proof for the Burmester-Desmedt protocol). Finally, we use our generalization of DDH to extend the celebrated computational soundness result of Abadi and Rogaway [1] so that it can also handle exponentiation and Diffie-Hellman-like keys. The extension that we propose crucially relies on our generalization and seems hard to achieve through other means.\nTitle:\nA generalization of DDH with applications to protocol analysis and computational soundness\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Before an evolutionary algorithm can be put into real-world applications, it is desirable that the algorithm was tested on a number of benchmark problems. On the other hand, performance measure on benchmarks can reflect if the benchmark suite is representative. In this paper, benchmarks are generated based on the performance comparison among a set of established algorithms. For each algorithm, its uniquely easy (or uniquely difficult) problem instances can be generated by an evolutionary algorithm. The unique difficulty nature of a problem instance to an algorithm is ensured by the Kruskal-Wallis H-test, assisted by a hierarchical fitness assignment method. Experimental results show that an algorithm performs the best (worst) consistently on its uniquely easy (difficult) problem. The testing results are repeatable. Some possible applications of this work include: 1) to compose an alternative benchmark suite; 2) to give a novel method for accessing novel algorithms; and 3) to generate a set of meaningful training and testing problems for evolutionary algorithm selectors and portfolios.\n\n\nTitle:\nEvolving benchmark functions using kruskal-wallis test.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We provide methods with which a user can search a large database of 3D meshes to find parts of interest, cut the desired parts out of the meshes with intelligent scissoring, and composite them together in different ways to form new objects. The main benefit of this approach is that it is both easy to learn and able to produce highly detailed geometric models -- the conceptual design for new models comes from the user, while the geometric details come from examples in the database. The focus of the paper is on the main research issues motivated by the proposed approach: (1) interactive segmentation of 3D surfaces, (2) shape-based search to find 3D models with parts matching a query, and (3) composition of parts to form new models. We provide new research contributions on all three topics and incorporate them into a prototype modeling system. Experience with our prototype system indicates that it allows untrained users to create interesting and detailed 3D models.\nTitle:\nModeling by example\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

DRUID is based on the fundamental concept of recursion, enabling a simple and direct network architecture that unifies the data, control, management, and security aspects of the current Internet, leading to a more trustworthy network. DRUID's architecture is based on a single recursive block that can adapt to support a variety of communication functions, including parameterized mechanisms for hard/soft state, flow and congestion control, sequence control, fragmentation and reassembly, compression, encryption, and error recovery. This recursion is guided by the structure of a graph of translation tables that help compartmentalize the scope of various functions and identifier spaces, while relating these spaces for resource discovery, resolution, and routing. The graph also organizes persistent state that coordinates behavior between individual data events (e.g., coordinating packets as a connection), among different associations (e.g., between connections), as well as helping optimize the recursive discovery process through caching, and supporting prefetching and distributed pre-coordination. This paper describes the DRUID architecture composed of these three parts (recursive block, translation tables, persistent state), and highlights its goals and benefits, including unifying the data, control, management, and security planes currently considered orthogonal aspects of network architecture.\nTitle:\nA Dynamic Recursive Unified Internet Design (DRUID)\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this, a structured matrix is formed by the Kronecker product of a series of smaller orthogonal matrices. This achieves O(dlogd) computational complexity and O(logd) space complexity for d-dimensional data, a drastic improvement over the standard unstructured projections whose computational and space complexities are both O(d^2). The proposed structured matrices are applicable to a number of application domains, and are faster and more compact than other structured matrices used in the past. We also introduce an efficient learning procedure for optimizing such matrices in a data dependent fashion. We demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed approach in solving the approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) image search problem with both binary embedding and quantization. We find that the orthogonality plays a very important role in solving ANN problem, since the random orthogonal Kronecker projection has already provided promising performance. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed approach can achieve similar or better accuracy as the existing state-of-the-art but with significantly less time and memory.\nTitle:\nFast Orthogonal Projection Based on Kronecker Product\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, the capture burden makes long-term manual tracking challenging. In this study on sleep tracking, we examine ways to reduce the capture burden of manual tracking while leveraging its benefits. We report on the design and evaluation of SleepTight, a low-burden, self-monitoring tool that leverages the Android's widgets both to reduce the capture burden and to improve access to information. Through a four-week deployment study (N = 22), we found that participants who used SleepTight with the widgets enabled had a higher sleep diary compliance rate (92%) than participants who used SleepTight without the widgets (73%). In addition, the widgets improved information access and encouraged self-reflection. We discuss how to leverage widgets to help people collect more data and improve access to information, and more broadly, how to design successful manual self-monitoring tools that support self-reflection.\nTitle:\nSleepTight: low-burden, self-monitoring technology for capturing and reflecting on sleep behaviors\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

We also show that the preferential attachment model so obtained has two novel features, saturation and viability, which have natural interpretations in the underlying network and lead to a power-law degree distribution with exponential cutoff. Moreover, we consider a generalized version of this preferential attachment model with independent saturation and viability, leading to a broader class of power laws again with exponential cutoff. We present a collection of empirical observations from social, biological, physical, and technological networks, for which such degree distributions give excellent fits. We suggest that, in general, optimization models that give rise to preferential attachment with saturation and viability effects form a good starting point for the analysis of many networks.\nTitle:\nEmergence Of Tempered Preferential Attachment From Optimization\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The train group behaviors model shows that the method can deal with temporal uncertainty issues during the train's movement including multipath selecting in conflict, train terminal time and the possibility of train operation plan implementation, thus provides the scientific basis for the reasonable train operation plan.

Yet, how such technologies should be evaluated within the context of HCI research remains unclear. In this paper, we argue that the obvious answer to this question - that evaluations should assess whether a technology brought about the intended change in behavior - is too limited. We propose that demonstrating behavior change is often infeasible as well as unnecessary for a meaningful contribution to HCI research, especially when in the early stages of design or when evaluating novel technologies. As an alternative, we suggest that HCI contributions should focus on efficacy evaluations that are tailored to the specific behavior-change intervention strategies (e.g., self-monitoring, conditioning) embodied in the system and studies that help gain a deep understanding of people's experiences with the technology.\nTitle:\nHow to evaluate technologies for health behavior change in HCI research\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

One emergent paradigm is that of ubiquitous collaboration, which provides widespread access to shared services through a variety of interactive devices, irrespective of whether individuals are mobile or deskbound. However, developing groupware that is interoperable across diverse, often mobile, environments can be difficult and costly. The fundamental issue is that current support infrastructures, which will meet the requirements for multi-user application development, are not operable within emerging ubiquitous settings. This paper explores this problem and presents a generic platform that promotes new forms of collaboration through mobility and ever-present computing services. The developed platform seeks to provide a wide range of collaborative services to a very diverse set of devices by adapting and extending existing middleware technologies.\nTitle:\nThe FUSE Platform: Supporting Ubiquitous Collaboration Within Diverse Mobile Environments\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The finger-walking-in-place (FWIP) navigation technique is used as a design example to demonstrate the concept of the action-transferred design approach. Leveraging 3D immersive virtual reality technology, we performed an empirical study to evaluate the performance of the action-transferred FWIP navigation technique in terms of spatial knowledge acquisition. The FWIP navigation technique was compared with a full-body-based walking-like (sensor-fusion walking-in-place; SF-WIP) navigation technique and a well-known, convenient (Joystick) navigation technique using a common input device, that is, a wand with a joystick. Both the action-transferred and the full-body-based navigation techniques were more effective for spatial learning than the navigation technique using the common input device. However, only the action-transferred FWIP navigation technique can provide users with the convenience of navigating with their fingers. These results suggest that the action-transferred design approach is useful in designing a navigation technique supporting users' spatial learning performance more effectively and conveniently. Possible design implications for broader applications are discussed and indicate that the action-transferred design approach is worth further study.\nTitle:\nAction-Transferred Navigation Technique Design Approach Supporting Human Spatial Learning\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Such atoms may be displaced due to the stress caused by high temperature, frequency and current, leading to failures. NBTI (negative bias temperature instability) is one of the most important sources of failure affecting transistors. NBTI degrades PMOS transistors whenever the voltage at the gate is negative (logic input \"0\"). The main consequence is a reduction in the maximum operating frequency and an increase in the minimum supply voltage of storage structures to cope for the degradation. Many PMOS transistors affected by NBTI can be found in both combinational and storage blocks since they observe a \"0\" at their gates most of the time. This paper proposes and evaluates the design of Penelope, an NBTI-aware processor. We propose (i) generic strategies to mitigate degradation in both combinational and storage blocks, (ii) specific techniques to protect individual blocks by applying the global strategies, and (iii) a metric to assess the benefits of reduced degradation and the overheads in performance and power.\nTitle:\nPenelope: The NBTI-Aware Processor\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In this paper we describe a novel method that can aid the understanding and the visualization of very large ER diagrams that is inspired by the link analysis techniques that are used in Web Searching. Specifically, this method takes as input an ER diagram and returns a smaller (top-k) diagram that consists of the major entity and relationship types of the initial diagram. Concerning the drawing of the resulting top-k graphs in the 2D space, we propose a force-directed placement algorithm especially adapted for ER diagrams. Specifically, we describe and analyze experimentally two different force models and various configurations. The experimental evaluation on large diagrams of real world applications proved the effectiveness of this technique.\nTitle:\nHow to tame a very large ER diagram (using link analysis and force-directed drawing algorithms)\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Intuitively, putting together game avatars that complement each other (synergy) and suppress those of opponents (opposition) would result in a stronger team. In-depth understanding of synergy and opposition relationships among game avatars benefits player in making decisions in game avatar drafting and gaining better prediction of match events. However, due to intricate design and complex interactions between game avatars, thorough understanding of their relationships is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose a latent variable model, namely Game Avatar Embedding (GAE), to learn avatarsu0027 numerical representations which encode synergy and opposition relationships between pairs of avatars. The merits of our model are twofold: (1) the captured synergy and opposition relationships are sensible to experienced human playersu0027 perception; (2) the learned numerical representations of game avatars allow many important downstream tasks, such as similar avatar search, match outcome prediction, and avatar pick recommender. To our best knowledge, no previous model is able to simultaneously support both features. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real match data from three commercial MOBA games illustrate the benefits of our model.\nTitle:\nModeling Game Avatar Synergy and Opposition through Embedding in Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, in case of low-resource language pairs such as English-Bengali, the performance is affected by insufficient amount of bilingual training data. Recently, comparable corpora became widely considered as valuable resources for machine translation. Though very few cases of sub-sentential level parallelism are found between two comparable documents, there are still potential parallel phrases in comparable corpora. Mining parallel data from comparable corpora is a promising approach to collect more parallel training data for SMT. In this paper, we propose an automatic alignment of English-Bengali comparable sentences from comparable documents. We use a novel textual entailment method and distributional semantics for text similarity. Subsequently, we apply template-based phrase extraction technique to aligned parallel phrases from comparable sentence pairs. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by using parallel phrases as additional training examples for an English-Bengali phrase-based SMT system. Our system achieves significant improvement in terms of translation quality over the baseline system.\nTitle:\nMining Parallel Resources For Machine Translation From Comparable Corpora\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For networks where all nodes are within transmission range of each other, it has been shown that such schedulers achieve the network capacity in the limiting region of large networks with a small sensing delay. However the design and analysis of CSMA schedulers for general networks has been an open problem due to the complexity of the interaction among coupled interference constraints. For networks with primary interference constraints, we introduce a tractable analysis of such CSMA schedulers based on a fixed point approximation. We then use the approximation to characterize the achievable rate region of static CSMA schedulers. We show that the approximation is asymptotically accurate for the limiting regime of large networks with a small sensing delay, and that in this case the achievable rate region of CSMA converges to the capacity region.\nTitle:\nAchievable Rate Region Of Csma Schedulers In Wireless Networks With Primary Interference Constraints\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Large deviations results are extended from the large buffer regime to the many sources limiting regime. Unfortunately, in the stable case, traditional large-deviations formulae degenerate into not very helpful asymptotic results, unlike the Gaussian case. This has a negative impact in engineering considerations (e.g., connection admission control, buffer management, statistical multiplexing gains), with respect to those results, and leads to alternative solutions, e.g. empirical/numerical and simulation techniques.\nTitle:\nEffective bandwidths and tail probabilities for Gaussian and stable self-similar traffic\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Therefore a lot of interest is currently devoted to the interaction of application level protocols with the QoS mechanism in IP networks. Among them SIP is currently having a lot of attention as a protocol for session signaling over the Internet. This work will describe an enhancement to SIP protocol for the interworking with a QoS enabled IP network. The proposed mechanism is simple and it fully preserves backward compatibility and interoperability with current SIP applications. Moreover the paper describes the application of this mechanism to a particular QoS enabled IP network, which implements DiffServ as transport mechanisms (the DiffServ mechanisms are obtained by means of Traffic Control functionalities with the TCAPI software libraries) and modified COPS clients for resource admission control. A test-bed implementation on Linux PCs of the proposed solutions is finally described.\nTitle:\nSIP Originated Dynamic Resource Configuration in DiffServ Networks: SIP / COPS / Traffic Control Mechanisms\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The ability to influence or even control these factors requires a deep understanding of the complex relations between process and product attributes in relevant contexts. Based on such understanding, decision support is needed to adjust processes so that they match the product quality goals without violating given project constraints. We propose to use a Virtual Software Engineering Laboratory (VSEL) to establish such decision support cost-effectively. VSELs can be considered as being complementary to existing (empirical) Software Engineering Laboratories. This paper gives an introduction into the cornerstones of VSELs, discusses how they complement traditional empirically based Software Engineering Laboratories (SELs), and illustrates with the help of case examples from industrial and research environments, how to use them in support of product-focused trade-off analyses.\nTitle:\nVirtual Software Engineering Laboratories in Support of Trade-off Analyses\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

(2007) [8] and Nikov et al. (2002) [34]. In the generalized setting, a (k,@?)-DOT-(n1) allows a sender to communicate one of n secrets to a receiver with the help of @? servers. Specifically, the transfer task of the sender is distributed among @? servers and the receiver interacts with k out of the @? servers in order to retrieve the secret he is interested in. The DOT protocols we consider in this work are information-theoretically secure. The known (k,@?)-DOT-(n1) protocols require linear (in n) communication complexity between the receiver and servers. In this paper, we construct (k,@?)-DOT-(n1) protocols which only require sublinear (in n) communication complexity between the receiver and servers. Our constructions are based on information-theoretic private information retrieval. In particular, we obtain both a specific reduction from (k,@?)-DOT-(n1) to polynomial interpolation-based information-theoretic private information retrieval and a general reduction from (k,@?)-DOT-(n1) to any information-theoretic private information retrieval. The specific reduction yields (t,@t)-private (k,@?)-DOT-(n1) protocols of communication complexity O(n^1^/^@?^(^k^-^@t^-^1^)^/^t^@?) between a semi-honest receiver and servers for any integers t and @t such that 1=\nTitle:\nCommunication-efficient distributed oblivious transfer\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The approach is based on the efficient use of this memory through the implementation of a software-managed cache. We also present an analytical model for performance analysis of such algorithms. We apply this technique to the implementation of the GPU-based solver of the sum-product or marginalize a product of functions (MPF) problem, which arises in a wide variety of real-life applications in artificial intelligence, statistics, image processing, and digital communications. Our motivation to accelerate MPF originated in the context of the analysis of genetic diseases, which in some cases requires years to complete on modern CPUs. Computing MPF is similar to computing the chain matrix product of multi-dimensional matrices, but is more difficult due to a complex data-dependent access pattern, high data reuse, and a low compute-to-memory access ratio. Our GPU-based MPF solver achieves up to 2700-fold speedup on random data and 270-fold on real-life genetic analysis datasets on GeForce 8800GTX GPU from NVIDIA over the optimized CPU version on an Intel 2.4GHz Core 2 with a 4MB L2 cache.\nTitle:\nEfficient computation of sum-products on GPUs through software-managed cache\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

They implement complex network protocol parsing in the unified packet parser - parsing all supported packet header fields in a single pass - and are commonly co-located with the virtualization layer. We find that this significantly reduces the barrier for low-budget attackers to launch high impact attacks in the cloud. This leads us to introduce the virtual switch attacker model for packet-parsing, in short the vAMP attack. Using OpenStack, a cloud operating system, and Open vSwitch, a virtual switch, we demonstrate how current virtual switch designs cannot withstand vAMP. Thereby giving a weak attacker full control of the cloud in a matter of minutes\n\n\nTitle:\nThe vAMP Attack: Taking Control of Cloud Systems via the Unified Packet Parser.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

One concern in this area is the potential to limit the designer's creativity by over-specifying the meta-design or the design process. This paper explains how design research encapsulates a two-person design team consisting of the design theorist and the artifact instance designer. Design theory embodies a creativity pass down effect in which the creative design thinking is partly executed by the design theorist and the completion of this thinking is deferred to the artifact instance designer. In fact, rather than limiting the instance designer's creativity, the design theorist may create an opportunity for the instance designer to be creative by passing down a design theory. Further, the artifact instance designer operates within the problem domain defined by design theorist, and engages in design thinking to achieve an innovative design by merging theoretical knowledge with experiential knowledge of a design artifact that is being built. The creativity pass down effect was examined through a case that involved developing a tool for multi-outsourcing decision making. The case provides empirical support for the creativity pass down effect.\nTitle:\nThe Creativity Passdown Effect: Sharing Design Thinking Processes with Design Theory\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Recent work suggests that the instantiation of specific roles may be central in bringing about de-escalation. However, few such roles have been identified to date and there has been no systematic study of key roles. In this paper, we therefore explore roles in IT project de-escalation using a single-case approach. Results suggest that de-escalation not only depends on the existence of particular roles, but also on role interaction. We identify seven roles that are of substantial importance in shaping whether and how de-escalation is carried out: messenger, exit sponsor, exit champion, exit blocker, exit catalyst, legitimizer, and scapegoat. Furthermore, we offer a set of propositions that capture key role interactions during de-escalation. Implications for research and practice are discussed.\nTitle:\nMaking IT Project De-Escalation Happen: An Exploration into Key Roles\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

However, some emerging applications with high bandwidth requirements and delay constraints, such as real-time video-on-demand and IPTV, suffer poor performance due to the high compression rate of video frames and/or high packet loss rate in the wireless access networks. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization algorithm referred to as the Network State Dependent Video Compression Rate (NSDVCR) algorithm, which determines the compression rates depending on the video characteristics and the network condition. The proposed NSDVCR algorithm is able to achieve optimal video transmission rate for a given network state characterized by packet loss rate. The simulation results of the proposed mechanism show that significant improvement of the video quality measured in terms of Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), is achieved compared with standard compression mechanisms.\nTitle:\nAdaptive Video Compression Rate Optimization In Wireless Access Networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Chirplet filters embody both the wavelet and STFT as special cases by decoupling the filter bandwidths and center frequencies. Chirplets, by their embodiment of affine geometry in the time-frequency (TF) plane, may also include shears in time and frequency (chirps) and even time-bandwidth product variation (noise bursts) if desired.

The protocol is based on the concepts of peer-to-peer caching of service advertisements and group-based intelligent forwarding of service requests. It does not require a service to be registered with a registry or lookup server. Services are described using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We exploit the semantic class/subClass hierarchy of OWL to describe service groups and use this semantic information to selectively forward service requests. OWL-based service description also enables increased flexibility in service matching. We present simulation results that show that our protocol achieves increased efficiency in discovering services (compared to traditional broadcast-based mechanisms) by efficiently utilizing bandwidth via controlled forwarding of service requests.\nTitle:\nToward Distributed Service Discovery in Pervasive Computing Environments\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

From even a brief exposure, biological motion cues enable the recognition of familiar people, and the inference of attributes such as gender, age, mental state, actions and intentions. In this paper we show that from the output of a video-based 3D human tracking algorithm we can infer physical attributes (e.g., gender and weight) and aspects of mental state (e.g., happiness or sadness). In particular, with 3D articulated tracking we avoid the need for view-based models, specific camera viewpoints, and constrained domains. The task is useful for man-machine communication, and it provides a natural benchmark for evaluating the performance of 3D pose tracking methods (vs. conventional Euclidean joint error metrics).

For feature extraction, the proposed MIDI preprocessing can extract individual, local and global melodic descriptions from MIDI files. In order to match query with target, we extend an existing search engine into a fast approximate melodic matching engine. Based on the integration of those three components, the system can return a list of MIDI files that are ranked by how closely they match the whistling. The systematic evaluation for the query-by-whistling system is finally performed. The results show that careful measurement and objective comparisons can lead us to know the scaling trend about query and target. One encouraging aspect is that the performance can be predicted based on the evaluation methods.\nTitle:\nWhistle for music: using melody transcription and approximate string matching for content-based query over a MIDI database\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Our system, dubbed Match-Net, consists of a deep convolutional network that extracts features from patches and a network of three fully connected layers that computes a similarity between the extracted features. To ensure experimental repeatability, we train MatchNet on standard datasets and employ an input sampler to augment the training set with synthetic exemplar pairs that reduce overfitting. Once trained, we achieve better computational efficiency during matching by disassembling MatchNet and separately applying the feature computation and similarity networks in two sequential stages. We perform a comprehensive set of experiments on standard datasets to carefully study the contributions of each aspect of MatchNet, with direct comparisons to established methods. Our results confirm that our unified approach improves accuracy over previous state-of-the-art results on patch matching datasets, while reducing the storage requirement for descriptors.

The proposed MD-FGS coding scheme is based on a combination of FGS and modified MD scalar quantization (MDSQ), named Base-MDSQ, in which partial prediction is utilized to control drifting error. We also propose an adaptive soft handoff algorithm to effectively mitigate video quality degradation caused by transient channel switching when a mobile client roams in wireless local area networks (WLANs). The handoff algorithm utilizes a channel estimator to decide which channels should be used for delivering video.

Considering the volume of user documents, efficient methods for grouping or searching relevant user documents are required. In the case of Twitter, self-defined metadata called hashtags are attached to tweets for that purpose. However, due to the wide scope of hashtags, users are having difficulty in finding out appropriate hashtags for their tweets. In this paper, we propose a new hashtag recommendation scheme for user tweets based on user tweet analysis and hashtag classification. More specifically, we extract keywords from user tweets using TF-IDF and classify their hashtags into pre-defined classes using Naive Bayes classifier. Next, we select a user interest class based on keywords of user tweets to reflect user interest. To recommend appropriate hashtags to users, we calculate the ranks of candidate hashtags by considering similar tweets, user interest and popularity of hashtags. To show the performance of our scheme, we developed an Android application named \"TWITH\" and evaluate its recommendation accuracy. Through various experiments, we show that our scheme is quite effective in the hashtag recommendation.\nTitle:\nHashtag Recommendation Based On User Tweet And Hashtag Classification On Twitter\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

The goal of this work is to improve power efficiency of superscalar processors through instruction reuse at the execution stage. This paper proposes a new method for reusing instructions when they compose small loops: the loop's instructions are first buffered in the Reorder Buffer and reused afterwards without the need for dynamically unrolling the loop, as commonly implemented by the traditional instruction reusing techniques. The proposed method is implemented with the introduction of two new auxiliary hardware structures in a typical superscalar microarchitecture: a Finite State Machine (FSM), used to detect the reusable loops; and a Log used to store the renaming data for each instruction when the loop is \"unrolled\". In order to evaluate the proposed method we modified the sim-outorder tool from Simplescalar v3.0 for the PISA, and Wattch v1.02 Power Performance simulators. Several different configurations and benchmarks have been used during the simulations. The obtained results show that by implementing this new method in a superscalar microarchitecture, the power efficiency can be improved without significantly affecting neither the performance nor the cost.\nTitle:\nLow power microarchitecture with instruction reuse\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Regardless of the priority of the node, the node closer to the head of bus has more chance to access the empty slots. To improve the ineffectiveness of the priority scheme in DQDB networks, we propose a Dynamic Priority Transmission Mechanism. The mechanism implements pre-emptive priorities. The higher priority node pre-empts lower priority node whenever necessary. The higher priority node buffers the lower priority data in its own queue first, and then transmits its higher priority segments. The average queue length and waiting time are analyzed and simulations are conducted to compare to the basic DQDB protocol and the previous researches. The results show that higher priority nodes in the Dynamic Priority Transmission Mechanism have lower delay and higher throughput than others. Moreover, a detailed implementation of the priority levels is also given and the characteristics are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The major project consists of an academic-year-long design task that is carried out by a group of about 20 students. These students are trained to operate as a multidisciplinary team based of sub- teams that handle the different design problems in a multidisciplinary way. Teaching assistants are added to the team to serve either as expert designer or as project leader of a team. In this way the students learn a lot about the circuits, systems and software they conceive but they also develop their teamwork, leadership and presentation skills. In this paper we will give an overview of the technical content of this project and describe the way how it is organised.

The most relevant contributions of the paper are a procedure for designing an incremental control law, whose different pieces cater for increasingly aggressive control requirements, and a modelling technique for the execution platform that allows us to design provably correct switching policies for the controllers. The methodology is validated by both simulations and experimental results.\nTitle:\nDesigning real-time embedded controllers using the anytime computing paradigm\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Extracting 'Real-Time Intention' (RTI) of a user from such short text updates is a huge opportunity towards web personalization and social networking around dynamic user context. In this paper, we propose novel ensemble approaches for learning and classifying RTI expressions from micro-blogs, based on a wide spectrum of linguistic and statistical features of RTI expressions (viz. high dimensionality, sparseness of data, limited context, grammatical in-correctness, etc.). We demonstrate our approach achieves significant improvement in accuracy, compared to word-level features used in many social media classification tasks. Further, we conduct experiments to study the run-time performance of such classifiers for integration with a variety of applications. Finally, a prototype implementation using an Android-based user device demonstrates how user context (intention) derived from social media sites can be consumed by novel social networking applications.\nTitle:\nDetection of Real-Time Intentions from Micro-blogs.\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

After reviewing the basic dissipativity concept, we stress the connections between Lyapunov designs and the problem of achieving passivity by feedback. Focusing on physical models, we then illustrate how the design of stabilizing feedback can take advantage of the natural energy balance equation of the system. Here stabilization is viewed as the task of shaping the energy of the system to enforce a minimum at the desired equilibrium. Finally, we show the implications of dissipativity theory as an appropriate framework to study the nonlinear H-infinity control problem.\nTitle:\nStabilization and Disturbance Attenuation of Nonlinear Systems Using Dissipativity Theory\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

For non-branching contours, experience has shown that the piecewise linear surface of minimum surface area which connects a pair of contours often provides a good solution. The current algorithm extends this idea by searching for the surface of minimal area which connects two contours comprised of more than one polygon. Several examples that justify this heuristic are provided.\nTitle:\nTriangulation Of Branching Contours Using Area Minimization\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

In the proposed design, we use space concentrators to reduce the switching complexity and multi-wavelength converters to reduce the cost of wavelength conversion in the network. A multi-wavelength converter is capable of simultaneously replicating a signal on an input wavelength to several different output wavelengths. The proposed approach provides a versatile framework for designing multicast switching networks with many a different tradeoffs between switching and conversion complexities to meet variety of application needs and technology constraints. A comparative analysis of the proposed multicast switching network and the existing design is also presented.\nTitle:\nA new class of strictly nonblocking WDM multicast switching networks\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.

Recent efforts attempt to deal with this problem mostly by ensuring that well-known properties of analysis environments are replaced with realistic values, and that any instrumentation artifacts remain hidden. For sandboxes implemented using virtual machines, this can be achieved by scrubbing vendor-specific drivers, processes, BIOS versions, and other VM-revealing indicators, while more sophisticated sandboxes move away from emulation-based and virtualization-based systems towards bare-metal hosts. We observe that as the fidelity and transparency of dynamic malware analysis systems improves, malware authors can resort to other system characteristics that are indicative of artificial environments. We present a novel class of sandbox evasion techniques that exploit the \"wear and tear\" that inevitably occurs on real systems as a result of normal use. By moving beyond how realistic a system looks like, to how realistic its past use looks like, malware can effectively evade even sandboxes that do not expose any instrumentation indicators, including bare-metal systems. We investigate the feasibility of this evasion strategy by conducting a large-scale study of wear-and-tear artifacts collected from real user devices and publicly available malware analysis services. The results of our evaluation are alarming: using simple decision trees derived from the analyzed data, malware can determine that a system is an artificial environment and not a real user device with an accuracy of 92.86%. As a step towards defending against wear-and-tear malware evasion, we develop statistical models that capture a system's age and degree of use, which can be used to aid sandbox operators in creating system images that exhibit a realistic wear-and-tear state.\nTitle:\nSpotless Sandboxes: Evading Malware Analysis Systems Using Wear-and-Tear Artifacts\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, complete the following task.
