On the plus side, it provides the same benefits as other rinses and does it without the burning sensation I get from those with alcohol. Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).\n\nBut how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than \"fresh mint\" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.\n\nI'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.\n\nIf you like really sweet tasting rinses this may be worth a shot. For me, however, it was not something I'd use again.\nProduct:\nCrest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse, Cool Wintergreen, 33.8 Fluid Ounce\n\nReview:\nThis is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!\n\nTo get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.\n\nI agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).\n\nThe water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.\n\nSound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.\n\nThe auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.\n\nIn actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.\n\nGood performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.\nProduct:\nWaterpik Ultra Water Flosser\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, generate a review for the given product purchased by the customer.

I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable.

I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.\n\nI poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water.

I have tried this company's soaps, though, and they are wonderful!\nProduct:\nPre de Provence Maison French Dried Lavender Blossoms for Fragrance\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, generate a review for the given product purchased by the customer.

I could smell it as I was opening the box it was shipped in, not an overpowering fragrance, but an inviting one that made me want to unwrap it and go take a shower with it. It's funny how some soaps are overscented with an artificial smelling fragrance and others have a very natural fragrance that I just can't get enough of. This soap it's definitely the later. This is the perfect soap for someone like me, who isn't a morning person, to have in the shower. It makes me feel good and puts a smile on my face - even early in the morning. It makes me want to linger in the shower just to experience that fragrance. It's a good thing that it's shea butter enriched. It keeps my skin from feeling dry, even it a hot shower.\n\nThis soap lathers really well and seems to be fairly hard milled since it isn't shrinking too fast, even with repeated use.\nProduct:\nPre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry\n\nReview:\nThese Urban Spa Moisturizing Gloves are a very effective way to moisturize your hands when they're dry and rough from gardening, household chores or dry cold weather. Simply use your favorite oil or moisturizer and then slip on these gloves. They keep the creams or oils on your hands instead of having it get all over the bedding while you sleep. In the morning, your hands feel softer and smoother, having been bathed in moisturizers all night. This can be very good for fingernails as well. If you have dry, brittle or peeling nails, the moisture will help to condition them. These gloves ensure that the hand or nail products stay on your hands or nails.\n\nI washed these in cold water the first time, but it was difficult to get much of the oil I used removed from them. The next time I used warm water that seemed to work better, with no detrimental effects to the gloves that I could see. They feel soft and hold up well.\nProduct:\nUrban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized\n\nReview:\nI have shoulder length hair that is kind of thick but very fine and straight. I used this Toni&Guy Volume Plumping Whip to give my hair a little volume and lift at the crown. A lot of volume adding products are too heavy and just weigh my hair down, but this one was different. I applied a little less than the walnut sized amount that they recommend to the roots of my hair right after shampooing and messaged it it, then blow dried it. It was light, so my hair wasn't weighed down and it gave it a small amount of lift and volume. My hair looks clean and not dull or sticky like some products. Realistically, I think the amount of volume that it added was about the max that I'm going to be able to get without weighing down my baby fine hair while still leaving it looking clean and shiny, so I'm giving this product 5 stars.\nProduct:\nToni&amp;Guy Glamour Volume Plumping Whip, 2.82 Fluid Ounce\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, generate a review for the given product purchased by the customer.

The scent is hard to describe. It smells a little floral and a little spicy on the bar. When I shower with it, I pick up more of a sandalwood scent. The scent is very strong from the bar and I smell it in the bathroom, but it doesn't linger on the skin so it won't clash with your perfume. The soap leaves my skin feeling very clean and it doesn't dry it out.\n\nI've used Pre de Provence soaps in the past and have always had good luck with them. The soap is hard milled and doesn't melt away too quickly. I have a wooden Pre de Provence retail display box that is about 10 years old and it still smells like their soap. My grandmother used to tuck scented soaps in her dresser drawers to keep her linens smelling fresh. This soap would be perfect for that.\nProduct:\nPre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry\n\nReview:\nI buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.\n\nThat said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.\nProduct:\nPre de Provence Maison French Dried Lavender Blossoms for Fragrance\n\nReview:\nI really like this nail brush from Urban Spa. The curved shape of the wood as well as the bristles makes it easy to grip when scrubbing under my nails. The wood is smooth and has a light finish on it. The thin row of bristles is cut short and it's stiff, so it really gets under the nails to remove garden dirt or anything else. The other side of the brush has a wider row of slightly softer bristles that clean the skin well. The brush dries quickly after use. Shedding is minimal. Overall, this is a handy little nail brush. I find it much easier to use than the plastic ones that are one-sided.\nProduct:\nUrban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, generate a review for the given product purchased by the customer.
