Purgatory is a BDSM club (so if that makes you squeamish, this isn't the book/series for you!) that is the setting for several novellas in the Purgatory Club Series (ROPED (Purgatory Club BDSM Erotica), Whipped (Purgatory), Displayed (Purgatory Club: BDSM Erotica) & Burned (Purgatory Club BDSM Erotic) -- I've only read \"Roped\" so far & it is H.O.T.!!!).  The Purgatory Masters series are full-length novels - Tucker's Fall is a fair price of $4.99 for around 250 pages.\n\nTucker & Maggie had a kiss in high school... then she went off to college, got married & became a professor with an emphasis on sexuality studies.  Well, Maggie got herself caught up in a FBI sting in a BDSM club and was arrested... so then she got jail time, a divorce, and her pink slip from the college.  She goes back to her hometown to lick her wounds and try to compile all her years of research on BDSM into a book - and runs into Tucker.  Tucker offers to teach her about submission and their relationship begins.  However, Maggie is trying to avoid publicity from her very public arrest / downfall... and Tucker is trying to avoid publicity due to a big secret in his past... and this causes them to be hurtful to each other which may cause the end of their relationship.\n\nOverall, a great read.  While there are some HEAVY  BDSM \"scenes\" between the two, they typically take place at Tucker's home so don't be put off if you don't want to read about the club stuff.  It's not really there.  However, there is bondage, anal toys/sex and use of a crop.  (That was your warning.)  It's a really great set-up for the series, too - you get into the \"mystery\" and get involved in the relationship between the `Masters' and how it has shaped them as men and as Doms.  There are things that could have been developed more, but I think that the hesitance to do so might be more about not wanting to reveal the whole backstory.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\n4.5 stars!!\n\nIT'S A TRAP!\n\nDammit. Y'all know that serials PISS. ME. OFF. Guess what? \"WOLF BAIT is the first book in the Wolf Cove series\" does not, to me, translate to -- \"WOLF BAIT ends in a cliff hanger - so sorry\". I expected that it meant the author planned to then feature other staff from Wolf Cove. Plus, with the title, I thought there might have even been a surprise of a shifter going on and it just wasn't referenced in the blurb (by the way - NO, there is NOT). Imagine my pissed-offed-ness when I reached the end... &*@#$(!!!!!  By the way, don't be put off by the \"lot of sex\".  The main characters don't really have sex until about 90% of the way into the story, but before that there is an (overseen) lesbian scene and masturbation scene... so don't turn the book away thinking it is going to be filled edge to edge with smut.  It's not.\n\nWhat IS it filled with?  Not an ending.  Not even a HFN.  (Sorry - I hold a grudge.  Just think about how many times I've said that I'm still angry with Bella Jewel for beating me to a teary pulp at the end of SHADE.  See.  GRUDGE-HOLDER.)  This is the story of a church sheltered college junior who expects to graduate from her Christian college in a year, marry her childhood / neighbor sweetheart fiance who is the pastor's son, and give him her virginity on their wedding night.  Not that they haven't been tempted by some heavy make-out sessions, but Jed always held back.  Well, except for that time Abbi finds him balls deep in another girl...  So Abbi goes to the job fair & interviews for a summer hotel position at the newly opening \"Wolf's Cove Lodge\" in Alaska, and gets the call that she's gotten on staff.\n\nHer first night there she has her first drink, gets drunk, and runs into Mr. Wolf... and a fascination is born.  If you want to try to pigeonhole it, the Virgin / Billionaire trope probably works best.  There's a lot of subplot going on -- Henry Wolf is controlled by his father dangling control of the Wolf lodge chain in front of him, just as Abbi is controlled by her Mama's approval & fear of the Church teachings. (I'm assuming the second novel will take into account the amount of self-subjugation these characters are willing to endure for their goals!) It's also a novel of awakenings -- Abbi to owning her sexuality and independence, and Henry to balancing the lessons of his grandparents against the goals of his father.  There's also a little subtext in there about self-worth, and not accepting cheating from your significant other just to appease public opinion / community expectations.\n\nOriginally posted on SnarkyMomReads\nSnarky Mom's Scale of Awesomeness!

(As an interesting sidenote - if you click on the author's highlighted name, it takes you to her website.  She is on a quest to write 12 novels in 12 months - looks like she'll do it, too!)  This is the first thing I've read from Dakota Madison, so I wasn't sure what to expect - but what I didn't expect was a novel that is part of a serialized series.  Doesn't make sense?  What I mean is that yes, you could read \"Fire On Ice\" as a standalone because it has an \"ending\"... but it's really NOT an ending because there are so many \"loose threads\".  While I would typically rant & rave about being caught by something like that, I'll be a bit more lenient about my bitching & moaning this time since the author is planning to crank out a book a month.\n\nI did receive a copy of this for free, from Story Cartel, with the request for a review.  I always try to support the indie authors so I try really hard to honor that request & get reviews done, so, here goes!\n\nKian is from the poor end of Boston and has been picked up by a new minor league hockey team in Arizona.  Taylor is a socialite-in-training in college, hoping to get into the psychology doctoral program.  Unfortunately, Taylor has an incredibly upsetting past with a hockey player from high school which means she has not dated anyone in over 3 years.  This is a sports romance; you get some hockey team antics and a game, but it isn't the whole setting of the book.  There's also a lot of angst that is commonly found in the NA genre; both Kian and Taylor thinking they are not good enough for the other (he because of economic/academic disparity, she because of her past/reputation).  Throw in some sex.... hockey... and a wannabe rapist/stalker... and you've got \"Fire On Ice\"!  This is a definite carpool lane read, but don't think too hard about it - it's meant to be a fun read from the author!\nScore:\n3\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

(Check her out here: [...] ) Her fourth in the series just came out a few days ago & I picked it up last night.  H.O.T. !!!  OMG!  So the title is \"Bases Loaded (Mustangs Baseball)\", and apparently it refers to a \"secret club\" that these FICTIONAL major league ballplayers have created, where there is a sexual challenge put forth to women who are invited to participate -- and the result for those who make it through all (4) bases is some jewelry pierced into some... um... personal spots.\n\nAnyway - this is the story of Antonio & Clare - Antonio is new to the Dallas Mustangs baseball club and Clare is a college music professor who moonlights as the baseball team's organist.  He catches sight of her at a fundraiser and realizes then & there that she is his soul-mate.  However, she is \"curvy\" and has massive self-esteem issues, so when he hits on her, she thinks he's being a bully & trying to humiliate her.  The resulting story is how he works through what he thinks are perverted needs for the woman who will bear his children, and she works through her body issues, as they fall in love.  Since it is the off-season, he has lots of free time in which to \"woo\" Clare.  The ultimate problem?  She wants to \"run the bases\" for his \"Bases Loaded\" sex club; he feels too possessive and they have constant clashes over this.  If you want to find out how it all shakes out... READ THE STORY!!!  (Disclaimer:  toy play, anal, m/m/m/f, light bondage.)\n\nOkay, so I'm always a vocalist about digital book pricing, so I will say that this is very well priced for the amount of pages it has - WELL worth the money!!!  This isn't SOLELY sexually based; beyond the character growth of Clare learning to like herself as she is and to realize her inner AND outer beauty, there is a female bully (& don't we ALL know some absolute BITCH who just LIVES to make others feel like crap??!!!??) who threatens public humiliation of Clare and Antonio, which would result in the loss of his contract.  Lots of angst... lots of sex... lots of self-realization that beauty isn't all about Barbie dimensions!\n\nGo read it.  It's awesome.  Just make sure the Partner or BOB is nearby - you may need their \"assistance\".

I absolutely loved her writing style, witty dialogue, and sense of humor.  The Confessions of A Reformed Tom Cat was entertaining, fun, charming, sexy, and romantic.  I loved that the book was written from Toms POV and each chapter was a confession.  He is a fun guy that doesnt take himself too seriously and recognizes his faults as well as strengths.  He loves his family, hes hard working, hes honest, and hes true.  Watching this man whore fall was fun and swoon worthy.\n\nHailey is one of those heroines that is easy to love.  She has known Tom since childhood.  He is her best friends older brother.  Shes got his number, she knows that he is a manwhore with a revolving door.  She still cant help falling for him.  When it becomes clear that she is the perfect woman for him, she gives him a few lessons that will capture his attention and heart.\n\nThis book was a fun, witty, and sexy read.

I can honestly say everything I heard proved to be true.\n\nQuinn is the first book in the Undaunted Men series.  This book is super sexy, fast paced, loaded with action, and has a gritty backstory.  The added bonus is a furry friend becomes a very prominent character in this story.\n\nQuinn owes a mob boss, Tony Moretti, a favor and when the boss decides to collect, it's going to change the coarse of Quinn's life.  Quinn is a former military special ops operator.  After retirement from the military, he and his buddies formed a specialized private security agency.  One of their specialities is retrieval.  When Moretti's daughter runs away, he calls in his favor and hires Quinn to bring her home.\n\nThe story is that she is wanted for murder and very pregnant.  Quinn feels like he isn't getting the complete story but wants his ties to the mob severed.  She has disappeared into the national forest in North Carolina.  It should be pretty easy to track her and bring her home.  She's in his backyard, the playground he grew up in.  Like the old saying goes nothing is ever easy.\n\nAlexis Moretti ran after her fianc framed her for murder.  With the help of her best friend Connor, she disappears into the forest.  The idea is to hide out on the trails for a few weeks and resurface at the safe house.  Her former finance has an agenda and he won't rest until Alexis heels to his commands.\n\nFinding Alexis is easy.  Keeping her safe and alive is another story.  Quinn and Alexis will find something extraordinary on the trails.  They will find that once in a lifetime love.  Their happiness depends on staying alive.  At every turn they are faced with danger, murderers, and the elements.  There is definitely more to what's behind the Moretti family dynamics.  A mafia princess and a seasoned warrior are about to step into a war.\n\nI loved this book and ended on a nail biting cliffhanger.  Readers will be hanging on the edge of their seats to find out what happens to Quinn and Alexis.  They will also be dying to find out the secrets that caused Alexis to flee.\n\nI can't wait for the next book.  Quinn II will release on April 19, 2016.  Quinn and Alexis fate is hanging by a thread.\nScore:\n5\n\nReview:\nI have only one word to describe Love,Chloe by Alessandra Torre\n\nDelightful!\n\nAlessandra Torre never fails to surprise me as a reader.  She is known for her dark, gritty, erotic romances.  She has also proven that she can write a light hearted, fun contemporary romance that has the readers charmed.  Love, Chloe is another great success that she can add to her impressive bibliography.\n\nThis delightful story begins with a spoiled rich heiress losing everything she possessed.  Her parents have abandoned her and are facing prison time.  The FBI has seized her uptown New York City apartment.  Her perfect trust fund billionaire boyfriend is a cheat.  Her best friends are spending time in South Beach rather than commiserating with her new pauper life.  Shes forced to crash on her friends couch.  Shes forced to get a job.  Chloe Madison has to turn a new leaf whether she wants to or not.\n\nOver the next year readers will follow Chloes journey to becoming a new person.  A person that is real, sincere, and has values that go beyond designer shoes.  Shell land her first job as a PA for the adorable pooch Chanel, who has a better wardrobe than she does.  Shell get promoted to PA to the evil condom heiress, Nicole, and not because she was doing her job well.  Along the way shell kiss the hottest movie star in Hollywood and become the latest topic in the tabloids. Shell be gifted diamonds and cars by another pursuer and turn them down on mere principal.  Or maybe because a certain handyman/ super has caught her attention.\n\nChloe Madison is learning about real life.  Chloe Madison is learning who Chloe Madison really is.  When she looks into the mirror she is going to like what she sees.  And the big bonus for Chloe is that shes going to find her prince and the true meaning of love.\n\nI absolutely loved this book.

I had reservations because it is an older game (2006) and I figured going in that the graphics weren't going to be what we're used to here in 2012.  Certainly this is true but the graphics are still really good, I think this game was probably ahead of its time in that area.\n\nThe main reason I wanted to go ahead and play it is that I had never played a Hitman game before but when I saw the trailers for the new Hitman 4 coming out, I got really interested.  I didn't want to make the same mistake I made with GTA though which was I played GTA 4 as my first GTA experience and I LOVED it, it was amazing.  Then I went back and tried to play GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas and I couldn't do it because I had gotten so used to the way GTA 4 worked that going back to a game that was older and didn't look or feel as good simply didn't work for me.  So my plan with Hitman was to play the older one first and that way the new one would feel even better!\n\nSo about the game.  I've played a few missions so far and what I love the most about it is the fact that its kind of open ended.  You get a mission and there's a huge ton of different ways you can complete it.  You can walk around for a while, be patient, take your time. You can make things look like an accident, you can go in guns blazing if you want, you can sneak up on people if you prefer.  You can kill only your targets or you can feel fine with some collateral damage and wipe out a few bystanders.\n\nObviously some choices will give you more credit and lower notoriety than others, but the fact that you have this amazing freedom to figure things out for yourself and that there's really not a \"right\" way or a \"wrong\" way to complete the missions.  As I say, some ways may be more optimal than others, but you can tackle them in the way that fits your style of gameplay best...or even better, you can play missions over and over and try different tactics to see what works and what doesn't.\n\nI'm taking my time with each mission, really thinking about the tactics and discovering the areas so that I can formulate good plans.  This way I feel like I'm really a hitman who considers everything rather than just a guy running in and shooting everything, which obviously could work as well.  This being the case, I see many many hours and hours of potential gameplay in this thing.\n\nI bought this as a download on sale at another website for $2.46.  It works perfectly and is an amazing steal at that price, though frankly I was prepared to spend up to the $10 or so that Amazon had it for as well because I felt it would be worth it, and it definately totally is.  Especially with the new Hitman coming out, if you haven't played the series and are curious about it, try this one and I think you'll be hooked and ready for the next one.  I only wish that in future versions, they allow you to customize your character instead of having to be the bald guy.\nScore:\n4\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, give a score between [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to the following review by the same user.

It was 2 pretty full games in one with a good number of missions and it was neat to see how some of the missions overlap with GTA 4 and the two ELC games overlap with each other.\n\nPersonally I like to play games with customizable characters rather than a predetermined one.  I prefer to play as a girl when I can because playing as a guy is a bit strange but I can overlook it in this case.  As with GTA 4, the world is beautiful and realistic, the cars take damage and are neat, its fun to run over things or shoot at things or whatever.  I didn't feel the same emotional connection at the end as I did with GTA 4, but that's okey.  It was a fun couple of games and if you liked GTA 4 (or any of the other GTA games), then I highly recommend it.  Also, you don't need to have GTA 4 to play these.  Its not an expansion, ELC can stand alone on its own.\nScore:", "output": "5", "model_inf_time": 11.83}]
