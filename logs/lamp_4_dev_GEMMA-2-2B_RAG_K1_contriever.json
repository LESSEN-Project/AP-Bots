Recalling the experience of World War II, Shanghai scholar/entrepreneur Eric X. Li  mocks Abe's pledge in Singapore that the \"new Japanese\" will help their neighbors resist Beijing. The great danger now, writes the Australian scholar Hugh White , is that the ground is being laid for a catastrophic clash since both sides in this conflict assume incorrectly that the other will back down.

Defiant to the end, the philosopher voluntarily drank the poison himself in a suicidal display of dignity.\n\nThis weekend, Greek voters will decide in a referendum whether they will be force-fed more painful austerity, imposed by the jury of other European democracies, or, like Socrates, administer their own poison in a \"no\" vote that will likely push Greece out of the eurozone. Tragedy, too, such as we are witnessing today, had its origins in early Greek drama.\n\nNobel Laureate Joe Stiglitz and Martin Guzman argue that Greece will be better off administering the poison by its own hand. As they point out by examining the Argentine default in 2001, there is \"life after debt and default.\" Manolis Glezos, the elderly firebrand of Syriza, writes from Athens that, in a democracy, \"the people are the measure\" of their fate.

But isn't Pope Francis also right that, in today's diverse and connected world, we must exercise the civil restraint of \"respect\" for the non-fanatic faithful (see the other depiction of the Prophet acceptable among some Muslims on left above), even if we insist on irreverence toward political authority?\n\nFinding an equilibrium amid the frictions and fusions that abound in this global public space will determine whether or not we can forge a new cosmopolitan commons of the 21st century.\n\nThis week, The WorldPost engages this conundrum. Writing from Denmark, Flemming Rose, the Jyllands-Posten editor who commissioned cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad a decade ago that set off riots across the Muslim world, argues against \"the tyranny of silence\" fanatics would impose.
