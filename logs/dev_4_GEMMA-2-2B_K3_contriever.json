The repeated acts of violence emanating from Gaza and the relative calm in the occupied West Bank are used to \"validate\" this claim.

Recalling the experience of World War II, Shanghai scholar/entrepreneur Eric X. Li  mocks Abe's pledge in Singapore that the \"new Japanese\" will help their neighbors resist Beijing. The great danger now, writes the Australian scholar Hugh White , is that the ground is being laid for a catastrophic clash since both sides in this conflict assume incorrectly that the other will back down.

But as Mark Famaner and Hanna Hindstrom point out, it is \"democracy on a leash\" as the long-standing military rulers retain a constraining foothold through the current constitutional arrangement. It remains to be seen if Suu Kyi's elected government will be \"above\" those constraints, as she has boldly asserted. Writing from Yangon, Ma Thida lays out the many issues in the political transition ahead.\n\nHarrison Akins reminds us that the \"shadow\" over Myanmar's democratic turn is the continuing persecution and discrimination against the Muslim Rohingya minority.\n\nIf it stabilizes, Myanmar could have a bright future.

Defiant to the end, the philosopher voluntarily drank the poison himself in a suicidal display of dignity.\n\nThis weekend, Greek voters will decide in a referendum whether they will be force-fed more painful austerity, imposed by the jury of other European democracies, or, like Socrates, administer their own poison in a \"no\" vote that will likely push Greece out of the eurozone. Tragedy, too, such as we are witnessing today, had its origins in early Greek drama.\n\nNobel Laureate Joe Stiglitz and Martin Guzman argue that Greece will be better off administering the poison by its own hand.

It was born out of a contradiction and a paradox.\n\nThe contradiction is that while the world is growing more interdependent, the media is fragmenting -- re-nationalizing, re-localizing and even tribalizing. The resulting paradox is that the information age is becoming the age of non-communication across boundaries -- political, cultural and ideological.\n\nThe aim of The WorldPost is to help bridge this growing chasm by becoming a platform where the whole world meets; a common zone where cross-pollination of ideas and perspectives from all corners of the planet can take place.\n\nTo achieve this aim, The WorldPost strives for a global viewpoint looking around, not a national perspective looking out. Along with intelligent curation of the global news and original reportage, what distinguishes us, above all, are the first person global voices of our contributors. Every week, they weigh in as events break from Havana to Beijing, from Moscow to Mexico City, Paris, New Delhi and Abuja among so many other places.\n\nThe WorldPost seems to have met an outstanding need. Thanks to you, one year later we have reached 28 million monthly views. We've shown that the message can catch up to the medium if we put our minds to it.

Not a leader to rest on the laurels of his country's remarkable success so far in rising to the top ranks of the global economy, Xi wants to leap over the \"middle-income trap\" in which development becomes stuck in a low-wage manufacturing export economy. To do that, he needs to avoid, in his own words, the \"Thucydides trap\" of conflict between China as a rising power and the U.S. as the established power so instability does not disrupt growth prospects.

In light of the West's weak response to Putin's takeover of the Crimea, some Asian allies are concerned about whether the U.S. will stand steady in the event a conflict breaks out between one of its allies and China.\nTitle:\nObama's Asian Pivot: A WorldPost Review\n\nArticle:\nA furious war of words was unleashed at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore last weekend. The U.S. and Japan accused China of trying to change the status quo by coercion and intimidation; the Chinese accused Japan and the U.S. of inciting instability with its \"20th century mentality\" of war and conflict. Following up on his comments in Singapore, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  writes in The WorldPost that China ought to abide by the rule of law in the seas of Asia and calls for negotiations.  Recalling the experience of World War II, Shanghai scholar/entrepreneur Eric X. Li  mocks Abe's pledge in Singapore that the \"new Japanese\" will help their neighbors resist Beijing. The great danger now, writes the Australian scholar Hugh White , is that the ground is being laid for a catastrophic clash since both sides in this conflict assume incorrectly that the other will back down. South Korea's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se  fears a \"Pandora's box\" is being opened in Asia. Marking the 25 years since the Tiananmen massacre, China scholar Perry Link worries that Xi Jinping is becoming \"a Mao-like strongman.\"(continued)\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: The New China Faces the 'New Japanese'\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, generate a title for the given article by the same author.

Writing from Athens, HuffPost Greece Editorial Director Sophia Papaioannou says Alexis Tsipras' electoral victory will give suffering Greeks \"space and time\" to address their predicament. Former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou argues that the path forward after the election is for a national referendum on a \"Greek plan\" for reform that will bind a now polarized nation. Rena Dourou, a deputy of the victorious Syriza party, notes that the vote was as much against the corruption of the formerly ruling political parties in Greece as it was against austerity. (continued)\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: Greece Revolts!\n\nArticle:\nThe savagery of the Islamic State taunted the world once again this week, striking out at both geopolitically toothless Japan and the tribal kingdom of Jordan. Islamic State fighters beheaded the journalist Kenji Goto and revealed that, in an act of unfathomable cruelty, they had burned alive a captured Jordanian pilot.\n\nLast week Japan's former defense chief Yuriko Koike wrote from Tokyo that Japan's constitutional restrictions on using force have prevented it from taking action against ISIS, and argues that that must change. Writing from Beirut, Jordanian analyst Rami Khouri has political misgivings about official support across the Arab world for the anti-ISIS coalition when the public is not consulted. From Amman, WorldPost Middle East Correspondent Sophia Jones reports both on the massive protests against ISIS and on the undercurrent of opposition in Jordan that believes the fight against ISIS \"is not our war.\" (continued)\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: ISIS Savagery Taunts the World\n\nArticle:\nThe first principle of an open society is not to let the intolerant define \"the territory of insult\" -- those areas off limits to criticism or ridicule. But how does one define \"territory\" when media now crosses the boundaries of nations, cultures and civilizations?\n\nIn the end, free societies must defend the right of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists against murder by fanatics, the Sony filmmakers against the North Korean regime and novelists like Salman Rushdie against a fatwa from the ayatollahs. But isn't Pope Francis also right that, in today's diverse and connected world, we must exercise the civil restraint of \"respect\" for the non-fanatic faithful (see the other depiction of the Prophet acceptable among some Muslims on left above), even if we insist on irreverence toward political authority?\n\nFinding an equilibrium amid the frictions and fusions that abound in this global public space will determine whether or not we can forge a new cosmopolitan commons of the 21st century.\n\nThis week, The WorldPost engages this conundrum. Writing from Denmark, Flemming Rose, the Jyllands-Posten editor who commissioned cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad a decade ago that set off riots across the Muslim world, argues against \"the tyranny of silence\" fanatics would impose. Mehdi Hasan says he is \"fed up with free speech fundamentalists\" who feel they have a \"duty to offend.\" (continued)\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: Laughing at God\n\n</EXAMPLES>\nWith the given examples, generate a title for the given article by the same author.

In Tunisia alone the spirit of the Jasmine Revolution still flowers.\n\nWhile the character of Tunisian society and culture has much to celebrate with its success, including just-completed peaceful elections that favored the main secular party, there is another factor: the absence of outside intervention, particularly from the West.\n\nIn The WorldPost this week Rafik Abdessalem, Tunisia's former foreign minister, explains why despotism will never return to his country. Soumaya Ghannoushi argues that the many years that activists from the moderate Islamist Ennahdha Party spent in exile abroad taught them \"the art of compromise and consensus, which may be the hallmark of the nascent Tunisian political model.\" Jonathan Labin, head of Middle East, Africa and Pakistan for Facebook, chronicles how the same social media that fomented political upheaval is now connecting young people in the region to jobs.

This is the inconvenient message emerging in the wake of the Xi-Obama deal on global warming announced in Beijing this week.\n\nBoth leaders will pursue executive action to fulfill their pledges. As Kerry Brown writes, Xi's decision is binding within China because a long process of consultation and consensus building within the Communist Party stands behind it. What Obama can do is up for grabs. No sooner did the pledge escape his lips than the incoming Republican majority leaders in the U.S. Congress make their own pledge to block Obama by any means necessary.\n\nIn The WorldPost this week, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim writes that the landmark Xi-Obama agreement is not only good for the environment, but also for the economy. Environmentalist Bill McKibben parses out \"what the deal is, and what it isn't.\" (continued)\nTitle:\nWeekend Roundup: The Inconvenient Truth About the Xi-Obama Deal -- It Takes a Strong State to Fight Climate Change\n\nArticle:\nOn the same day this week that President Obama announced a measure that could give legal protection to 5 million undocumented immigrants, massive protests raged across Mexico against the impunity and corruption that led to the horrific massacre of 43 students. From Mexico City, Sergio Sarmiento, Elena Poniatowska and Homero Aridjis chronicle the events and ponder what's next. Anthropologist Claudio Lomnitz examines the causes behind Mexico's corrosive impunity.\n\nMeanwhile, as Xin Chunying writes from Beijing, China is also seeking to establish the rule of law through steadily boosting the role of the National People's Congress. While stifling dissent, China's President Xi is taking on both \"tigers and flies\" in his no-holds-barred assault from the top down on corruption.\n\nCan China's effort succeed without active public engagement? Can Mexico learn from China and move from angry protest to systemic change?

Not a leader to rest on the laurels of his country's remarkable success so far in rising to the top ranks of the global economy, Xi wants to leap over the \"middle-income trap\" in which development becomes stuck in a low-wage manufacturing export economy. To do that, he needs to avoid, in his own words, the \"Thucydides trap\" of conflict between China as a rising power and the U.S. as the established power so instability does not disrupt growth prospects.
